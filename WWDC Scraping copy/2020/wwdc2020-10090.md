Search this videoâ€¦Hello and welcome to WWDC.Hi, and welcome to ProRes Decoding with AV Foundation and Video Toolbox.Our goal today is optimizing the path from a ProRes movie file,or really any other video, into your application.So, you have an amazing video-editing app in a really cool Metal rendering engine.You want to ensure that users have the best possible experienceworking with ProRes content in your app.Our goal is to make two things happen:leverage available hardware decoders, like Afterburner,and make sure that you have an optimized and efficient pathfor the flow of compressed data,as well as for the frames coming out of the decoder.So, first we're going to do an overview of some of the conceptsaround integrating video into an app.Then we're gonna discuss how AV Foundation can do it all for you.But doing it all at the AV Foundation level isn't right for everyone,so next we'll talk a little bitabout how you can fetch or construct compressed samplesif you choose to drive the decoder yourself with the Video Toolbox.Then we'll talk a little bit about how to use a VTDecompressionSession.And finally, we'll cover some best practicesfor integrating decoded video frames with Metal.All right, let's talk about some basics for working with video on our platforms.First, let's talk briefly about video decoders.Video decoders do a lot of parsing of bitstreamsthat can come from a wide range of sourcesnot always fully controlled by users.This presents opportunities for malformed mediato destabilize an application,or even exploit vulnerabilities and create security issues.To mitigate these concerns,the Video Toolbox runs decoders out-of-process in a sandboxed server.This both provides security benefitsby running the decoder in a process with limited privileges,but it also adds application stability.If there is a crash in the video decoder, the result is a decode errorrather than crashing your entire application.All right, let's talk about the media stack on mac OS,and for this talk, we're going to be focused on video.At the top, we have AVKit.AVKit provides very high-level optionsfor dropping media functionality into an app.Since we want to integrate with your existing render pipeline,we aren't going to be looking at AVKit.AV Foundation provides a powerful and flexible interfacefor working with all aspects of media.We will be looking at a few interfaces in the AV Foundation framework.We have already, and will continue to talk about Video Toolbox,which provides a low-level interface for working with video decoders and encoders.The Core Media framework provides many basic building blocksfor any media operations on the platform.And finally, Core Video provides basic building blocksfor working specifically with video.So, we're going to be focusing on interfaces from these three frameworks:AV Foundation, Video Toolbox, and Core Video.In AV Foundation, we'll take a closer look at AVAssetReaderas well as AVSampleBufferGenerator.In Video Toolbox, we'll be looking more closely at VTDecompressionSession.And finally, in Core Video,we'll be looking at integrating CVPixelBuffersand CVPixelBufferPools with Metal.Let's talk a little bit about some considerationswhen working at these different API levels.First, in current versions of the OS,all media interfaces will automatically enable hardware decode when available.This includes enabling Afterburner.We'll talk later about how to selectively enable and disable hardware decode,but by default, it will always be used.Earlier, we talked about how video decoders run in a separate process.If CMSampleBuffers are created by AV Foundation,they are automatically generated in a formwhich optimizes them for transfer over the RPC boundary.When working with VTDecompressionSession directly,whether or not you get this optimized RPCdepends on how the CMSampleBuffers are generated.We'll talk more about this later onas we talk about generating CMSampleBuffers.Next, I want to dive into a little glossary.First, let's talk about CVPixelBuffers.CVPixelBuffers are essentially wrappersaround blocks of uncompressed raster image data.They have inherent properties like pixel format, height, width,and row bytes or pitch,but they can also carry attachments which describe the image data,things like color tags.Next we have CMBlockBuffer.This type is defined in the Core Media frameworkand serves as a basic type for wrapping arbitrary blocks of data,usually compressed sample data.Then we have CMSampleBuffers.CMSampleBuffers come in three main flavors.First, a CMSampleBuffer can wrap a CMBlockBuffercontaining compressed audio or video data.Second, a CMSampleBuffer can wrap a CVPixelBuffercontaining uncompressed raster image data.As you can see, both types of CMSampleBufferscontain CMTime valueswhich describe the sample's presentation and decode timestamps.They also contain a CMFormatDescriptionwhich carries information describing the format of the datain the SampleBuffer.CMSampleBuffers can also carry attachments,and this brings us to the third type of CMSampleBuffer,a marker CMSampleBuffer which has no CMBlockBuffer or CVPixelBufferand exists entirely to carry timed attachmentsthrough a media pipeline signaling specific conditions.Next we have IOSurface.An IOSurface is a very clever abstraction around a piece of memory,often used for image data.We talked about the raster data in a CVPixelBuffer.That raster data is usually in the form of an IOSurface.IOSurfaces can also be used as the basis for the memoryfor a texture in Metal as well.IOSurface allows the memory to be efficiently moved between frameworkslike Core Video and Metal,between processes like the sandboxed decoderand your application,or even between different memory regions,such as transfer between VRAM in different GPUs.And our final stop in our glossary is the CVPixelBufferPool.CVPixelBufferPools are objects from Core Videowhich allow video pipelines to efficiently recycle buffers used for image data.In most cases, CVPixelBuffers will wrap IOSurfaces.When a CVPixelBuffer allocated from a pool is releasedand no longer in use,the IOSurface will go back into the CVPixelBufferPoolso that the next CVPixelBuffer allocated from the poolcan reuse that memory.This means that CVPixelBufferPools have some fixed characteristics,just like CVPixelBuffers:the pixel format, height, width, and row bytes or pitch.All right, let's get straight into how AV Foundation can do it all for you.Let's go back to our original problem.You have a ProRes movie file,you have your awesome Metal rendering engine,and you want to get frames from that movie into your renderer.AVAssetReader can do it all for you.It reads samples from the source file,optimizing them for the RPC that will happen in the Video Toolbox.It decodes the video data in the sandbox process,and it provides the decoded CVPixelBuffersin the requested output format.Creating an AVAssetReader is pretty easy.First we create an AVAsset with a URL to a local movie.Then we create an AVAssetReader with that AVAsset,but the AVAssetReader isn't ready to use yet.Requesting decoded data from the AVAssetReaderinvolves configuring an AVAssetReaderTrackOutput.First we need to get the video track.Here we're getting an array of all of the video tracks in the movie,and then selecting the first track in that array.Your logic for selecting tracks may vary.Now we create an AVAssetReaderTrackOutputbased on the video track we selected.In this case, I'm choosing to configure the outputto return 16-bit 4:4:4:4 YCbCr with alpha,or Y416,which is a great native format to use when working with ProRes 4444 content.Next, we're going to instruct the AVAssetReaderTrackOutputto not copy samples when returning them.When setting this, we will get optimal efficiency,but it also indicates that the returned CMSampleBuffersmay be retained elsewhere, and we absolutely must not modify them.And finally, we need to add this output to our AVAssetReader.Running an AVAssetReader is pretty simple.I'll show you it operating in its simplest possible mode here.First, we just start it reading.Then we can loop over calls to copyNextSampleBuffer,and since we've configured it to provide decoded output,we check each output CMSampleBuffer for a CVImageBuffer.We will get some marker CMSampleBuffers with no image buffers, but this is okay.Using an AVAssetReader, you can set time rangesor do other more advanced operationsrather than this simple iteration through the track.Your video pipeline will be most efficientif your renderer is able to consume buffersin a format that is native to the decoder.AVAssetReader will convert the decoder outputfrom the decoder's native format to your requested output formatif you are requesting a format that the decoder does not support.But avoiding these buffer copieswill improve your application efficiency immensely.Here are some guidelines on choosing an output pixel formatthat will not result in a conversion.In the previous example, we configured the AVAssetReaderOutputto return buffers in 16-bit 4:4:4:4 YCbCr with alpha,or Y416,which is the optimal format when using ProRes 4444.For ProRes 422, 16-bit 4:2:2 YCbCr, or v216,is the most native decoder format to request.For ProRes RAW, RGBA half-float, or RGhA, provides the most native output.Sometimes there's reasonswhy one doesn't want to rely on AVAssetReader to do everything.In these cases, you'll need to generate CMSampleBuffersto feed directly to the Video Toolbox.There are three main options here.First, you can use AVAssetReader, much like we described a moment ago,but you can request that it give you the compressed datawithout decoding it first.This provides track-level media access,with awareness of edits and frame dependencies.Second, there is AVSampleBufferGenerator.This provides media-level access to samples,with no awareness of edits and frame dependencies.And finally, you can construct CMSampleBuffers yourself.Letting AVAssetReader generate your samplesprovides compressed data read directly from the AVAsset.AVAssetReader is doing track-level reading,which means it will provide all samples necessaryto display frames at the target time,including handling edits and frame dependencies.Also, as noted earlier,AVAssetReader will provide samples which are optimized for RPC,reducing sandbox overhead when the frames are sent to the Video Toolbox.In order to get raw compressed output from the AVAssetReader,you simply need to construct the AVAssetReader as described earlier,but when creating the AVAssetReaderTrackOutput,you'll set the outputSettings to nilrather than providing a dictionary specifying a pixel format.AVSampleBufferGenerator provides samples read directly from the mediain an AVAssetTrack.It uses an AVSampleBufferCursor to control the position in the trackfrom which it will read media.It has no inherent awareness of frame dependencies,so this may be straightforward to use with ProRes,but care must be taken when using this interfacewith content with inter-frame dependencies,like HEVC and H.264.Here's a brief code snippet showing how an AVSampleBufferGenerator is created.First you need to create an AVSampleCursorwhich will be used for stepping through samples.You must also create an AVSampleBufferRequestwhich describes the actual sample requests you will be making.Now you can create the AVSampleBufferGeneratorwith your source AVAsset.Note that I'm setting the timebase to nil here,which will result in synchronous operation.For optimal performance with AVSampleBufferGenerator,you would provide a timebase and run your requests asynchronously.Finally, I'm looping over calls to createSampleBufferForRequestand stepping the cursor forward one frame at a time.Again, this shows the simplest possible synchronous operation.For optimal performance, one would use async versions of these requests.Finally, you can create CMSampleBuffers yourselfif you're doing your own file readingor getting sample data from some other source, like the network.It's important to note that this sample datawill not be optimized for transfer over the sandbox RPC.Earlier, we talked about the components of a CMSampleBuffer.Once again, there's the data in a CMBlockBuffer,a CMFormatDescription, and some timestamps.So, first you need to pack your sample datain a CMBlockBuffer.Then you need to create a CMVideoFormatDescriptiondescribing the data.Here it would be important to include the color tagsin your extensionsDictionaryto ensure proper color management for your video.Next you would create some timestamps in a CMSampleTimingInfo struct.And finally, create a CMSampleBuffer using the CMBlockBuffer,the CMVideoFormatDescription and the CMSampleTimingInfo.Okay, you've decided to do it yourselfand you've created a source for CMSampleBuffers.On to the Video Toolbox.Let's take a look at the anatomy of a VTDecompressionSession.The VTDecompressionSession, of course, has a video decoder,and as described earlier,this will be running in a separate sandboxed process.The session also has a CVPixelBufferPoolwhich is being used to create the output buffersfor decoded video frames.And finally, if you have requested outputin a format which doesn't match what the decoder can provide,there will be a VTPixelTransferSession to do the required conversion.Before you get started, if your application needs to accessthe set of specialized decoders distributed for Pro video workflows,your application can make a callto VTRegisterProfessional- VideoWorkflowVideoDecoders.This only needs to happen once in your application.The steps to use a VTDecompressionSessionare pretty simple.First, create a VTDecompressionSession.Second, do any necessary configuration of the VTDecompressionSessionvia VTSessionSetProperty calls.This isn't always needed.Finally, begin sending frames using callsto VTDecompressionSession- DecodeFrameWithOutputHandler,or simply VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame.For optimal performance, it's recommended that asynchronous decode be enabledin your DecodeFrame calls.Let's look more closely at creating a VTDecompressionSession.There are three major options that need to be specified.First is the videoFormatDescription.This tells the VTDecompressionSession what codec will be used,and provides more details about the format of the datain the CMSampleBuffers.This should match the CMVideoFormatDescriptionof the CMSampleBuffers that you are about to send to the session.Next is the destinationImageBufferAttributes.This describes your output pixelBuffer requirements.This can include dimensionsif you want the Video Toolbox to scale output to a certain size.It can contain a specific pixelFormat if your rendering engine requires it.If you only know how to consume 8-bit RGB samples,this is where you would request that.This can also be a high-level directive,like a request to just provide Core Animation-compatible output.Next is the videoDecoderSpecification,which provides hints about factors for decoder selection.This is where you specify non-default hardware decoder requests.Speaking of hardware decoder usage,as mentioned earlier, on current OS versions,hardware decoder usage is enabled by defaultfor all formats where it's supported.This is a slight change from a few years ago when it was an opt-in.In current OSes, all hardware-accelerated codecsare available by default with no opt-ins required.If you want to guarantee that your VTDecompressionSessionis created with a hardware decoder,and want session creation to fail if it isn't possible,you can pass in the RequireHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoderspecification option set to true.Similarly, if you want to disable hardware decodeand use a software decoder,you can include EnableHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoderspecification option set to false.These two keys are awfully similar, so once more,the first key is RequireHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoderand the second is EnableHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoder.This sample shows the basics of VTDecompressionSession creation.The first thing that we need is a formatDescriptionto tell the session what type of data to expect.We pull this straight from a CMSampleBufferthat will be passed to the session later.If we want a specific pixelFormat for our output,we need to create a pixelBufferAttributes dictionarydescribing what we need.So, just like in the earlier AVAssetReader example,we're requesting 16-bit 4:4:4:4 YCbCr with alpha.Now we can create the VTDecompressionSession.Note that we're passing in NULL for the third parameter,the videoDecoderSpecification.This NULL means that the Video Toolboxwill do its default hardware decoder selection.Once the VTDecompressionSession is created,the calls to DecodeFrame are fairly straightforward.As mentioned earlier, for optimal performance,the kVTDecodeFrame_Enable- AsynchronousDecompression flagshould be set in the decodeFlags.The block-based VTDecompressionSession- DecodeFrameWithOutputHandlertakes the compressed sampleBuffer,the inFlags, which control decoder behavior,and an output block which will be called with the results of the decode operation.As long as the VTDecompressionSession- DecodeFrameWithOutputHandler calldoesn't return an error,your output block will be called with the results of the frame decode,either a CVImageBuffer or a decoder error.A quick note about decompression output.Decoder output is serialized.You should only see a single frame being returned from the decoder at a time.If you block inside of the decoder output,it will effectively block subsequent frame outputand ultimately cause back pressure through the decoder.For best performance, you should make sure that processing and work is doneoutside of your session's output block or callback.Now let's talk a little bit about using decoded CVPixelBuffers with Metal.Before diving into this,it's important to review exactly how a CVPixelBufferPool works.As described before,when a CVPixelBuffer which was allocated from a CVPixelBufferPool is released,its IOSurface goes back into the CVPixelBufferPool,and the next time a CVPixelBuffer is allocated from the pool,the IOSurface will be recycled and used for the new CVPixelBuffer.With this in mind, it's easier to understandthe pitfalls that one can encounter working with CVPixelBuffers and Metal.We need to ensure that IOSurfaces are not recycledwhile still being used by Metal.There are two main approaches to using CVPixelBuffers with Metal.One is the obvious bridge through IOSurface.The CVPixelBuffer contains an IOSurfaceand Metal knows how to use an IOSurface for texturing.But this path requires a bit of extra care.The second path is through Core Video's CVMetalTextureCache.This is less obvious, but generally simpler to use in a safe manner,and can provide some performance benefits.Using the IOSurface backing from a CVPixelBufferdirectly with Metal appears straightforward,but there's a trick to ensuring that the IOSurface is not recycledby the CVPixelBufferPool while it's still in use by Metal.To go this route, you first need to get the IOSurface from the CVPixelBuffer,and you can then create a Metal texture with that IOSurface.But you need to ensure that the IOSurfaceis not recycled by the CVPixelBufferPoolwhile it's still in use by Metal.So, we use the IOSurfaceIncrementUseCount call.To release the IOSurface back into the poolwhen Metal has finished with it,we set up a MTLCommandBuffer completion handlerto run after our CommandBuffer completes,and we decrement the IOSurfaceUseCount here.Using CVMetalTextureCache to manage the interfacebetween CVPixelBuffer and MetalTexture simplifies things,removing the need to manually track IOSurfaces and IOSurfaceUseCounts.To use this facility, you need to first create a CVMetalTextureCache.You can specify the Metal device you want to associate with here.Now you can call CVMetalTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImageto create a CVMetalTexture object associated with your CVPixelBuffer.And getting the actual Metal texture from the CVMetalTextureCacheis a simple call to CVMetalTextureGetTexture.And the last thing to keep in mind here is that once again,you must set up a handler on your Metal command buffer completion,or otherwise ensure that Metal is done with the texturebefore you release the CVMetalTexture.CVMetalTextureCache also saves you from repeating the IOSurface texture bindingwhen IOSurfaces which come from a CVPixelBufferPoolare reused and are seen again, making it a little bit more efficient.Okay, so we covered a few topics here.We talked about when you will get hardware decode, and how to control it.We talked about how AV Foundation's AVAssetReadercan simply and easily allow you to integrate accelerated video decodingwith your custom rendering pipeline.We talked about how to construct CMSampleBuffersand use them with the Video Toolboxif using AVAssetReader on its own isn't a good fit for your use case.And finally, we talked about some best practicesaround using CVPixelBuffers with Metal.I hope that what we've discussed todayhelps you make your amazing video app a little bit more amazing.Thanks for watching and have a great WWDC.

Hello and welcome to WWDC.

Hi, and welcome to ProRes Decoding with AV Foundation and Video Toolbox.Our goal today is optimizing the path from a ProRes movie file,or really any other video, into your application.

So, you have an amazing video-editing app in a really cool Metal rendering engine.You want to ensure that users have the best possible experienceworking with ProRes content in your app.

Our goal is to make two things happen:leverage available hardware decoders, like Afterburner,and make sure that you have an optimized and efficient pathfor the flow of compressed data,as well as for the frames coming out of the decoder.So, first we're going to do an overview of some of the conceptsaround integrating video into an app.Then we're gonna discuss how AV Foundation can do it all for you.

But doing it all at the AV Foundation level isn't right for everyone,so next we'll talk a little bitabout how you can fetch or construct compressed samplesif you choose to drive the decoder yourself with the Video Toolbox.

Then we'll talk a little bit about how to use a VTDecompressionSession.And finally, we'll cover some best practicesfor integrating decoded video frames with Metal.

All right, let's talk about some basics for working with video on our platforms.First, let's talk briefly about video decoders.Video decoders do a lot of parsing of bitstreamsthat can come from a wide range of sourcesnot always fully controlled by users.This presents opportunities for malformed mediato destabilize an application,or even exploit vulnerabilities and create security issues.

To mitigate these concerns,the Video Toolbox runs decoders out-of-process in a sandboxed server.

This both provides security benefitsby running the decoder in a process with limited privileges,but it also adds application stability.If there is a crash in the video decoder, the result is a decode errorrather than crashing your entire application.All right, let's talk about the media stack on mac OS,and for this talk, we're going to be focused on video.

At the top, we have AVKit.AVKit provides very high-level optionsfor dropping media functionality into an app.Since we want to integrate with your existing render pipeline,we aren't going to be looking at AVKit.

AV Foundation provides a powerful and flexible interfacefor working with all aspects of media.We will be looking at a few interfaces in the AV Foundation framework.

We have already, and will continue to talk about Video Toolbox,which provides a low-level interface for working with video decoders and encoders.

The Core Media framework provides many basic building blocksfor any media operations on the platform.

And finally, Core Video provides basic building blocksfor working specifically with video.So, we're going to be focusing on interfaces from these three frameworks:AV Foundation, Video Toolbox, and Core Video.

In AV Foundation, we'll take a closer look at AVAssetReaderas well as AVSampleBufferGenerator.In Video Toolbox, we'll be looking more closely at VTDecompressionSession.

And finally, in Core Video,we'll be looking at integrating CVPixelBuffersand CVPixelBufferPools with Metal.

Let's talk a little bit about some considerationswhen working at these different API levels.

First, in current versions of the OS,all media interfaces will automatically enable hardware decode when available.This includes enabling Afterburner.We'll talk later about how to selectively enable and disable hardware decode,but by default, it will always be used.

Earlier, we talked about how video decoders run in a separate process.If CMSampleBuffers are created by AV Foundation,they are automatically generated in a formwhich optimizes them for transfer over the RPC boundary.

When working with VTDecompressionSession directly,whether or not you get this optimized RPCdepends on how the CMSampleBuffers are generated.We'll talk more about this later onas we talk about generating CMSampleBuffers.

Next, I want to dive into a little glossary.

First, let's talk about CVPixelBuffers.CVPixelBuffers are essentially wrappersaround blocks of uncompressed raster image data.They have inherent properties like pixel format, height, width,and row bytes or pitch,but they can also carry attachments which describe the image data,things like color tags.

Next we have CMBlockBuffer.This type is defined in the Core Media frameworkand serves as a basic type for wrapping arbitrary blocks of data,usually compressed sample data.

Then we have CMSampleBuffers.CMSampleBuffers come in three main flavors.First, a CMSampleBuffer can wrap a CMBlockBuffercontaining compressed audio or video data.

Second, a CMSampleBuffer can wrap a CVPixelBuffercontaining uncompressed raster image data.

As you can see, both types of CMSampleBufferscontain CMTime valueswhich describe the sample's presentation and decode timestamps.They also contain a CMFormatDescriptionwhich carries information describing the format of the datain the SampleBuffer.

CMSampleBuffers can also carry attachments,and this brings us to the third type of CMSampleBuffer,a marker CMSampleBuffer which has no CMBlockBuffer or CVPixelBufferand exists entirely to carry timed attachmentsthrough a media pipeline signaling specific conditions.

Next we have IOSurface.An IOSurface is a very clever abstraction around a piece of memory,often used for image data.We talked about the raster data in a CVPixelBuffer.That raster data is usually in the form of an IOSurface.

IOSurfaces can also be used as the basis for the memoryfor a texture in Metal as well.

IOSurface allows the memory to be efficiently moved between frameworkslike Core Video and Metal,between processes like the sandboxed decoderand your application,or even between different memory regions,such as transfer between VRAM in different GPUs.

And our final stop in our glossary is the CVPixelBufferPool.

CVPixelBufferPools are objects from Core Videowhich allow video pipelines to efficiently recycle buffers used for image data.

In most cases, CVPixelBuffers will wrap IOSurfaces.When a CVPixelBuffer allocated from a pool is releasedand no longer in use,the IOSurface will go back into the CVPixelBufferPoolso that the next CVPixelBuffer allocated from the poolcan reuse that memory.This means that CVPixelBufferPools have some fixed characteristics,just like CVPixelBuffers:the pixel format, height, width, and row bytes or pitch.

All right, let's get straight into how AV Foundation can do it all for you.Let's go back to our original problem.You have a ProRes movie file,you have your awesome Metal rendering engine,and you want to get frames from that movie into your renderer.

AVAssetReader can do it all for you.It reads samples from the source file,optimizing them for the RPC that will happen in the Video Toolbox.It decodes the video data in the sandbox process,and it provides the decoded CVPixelBuffersin the requested output format.

Creating an AVAssetReader is pretty easy.First we create an AVAsset with a URL to a local movie.

Then we create an AVAssetReader with that AVAsset,but the AVAssetReader isn't ready to use yet.

Requesting decoded data from the AVAssetReaderinvolves configuring an AVAssetReaderTrackOutput.

First we need to get the video track.Here we're getting an array of all of the video tracks in the movie,and then selecting the first track in that array.Your logic for selecting tracks may vary.

Now we create an AVAssetReaderTrackOutputbased on the video track we selected.In this case, I'm choosing to configure the outputto return 16-bit 4:4:4:4 YCbCr with alpha,or Y416,which is a great native format to use when working with ProRes 4444 content.Next, we're going to instruct the AVAssetReaderTrackOutputto not copy samples when returning them.When setting this, we will get optimal efficiency,but it also indicates that the returned CMSampleBuffersmay be retained elsewhere, and we absolutely must not modify them.

And finally, we need to add this output to our AVAssetReader.

Running an AVAssetReader is pretty simple.I'll show you it operating in its simplest possible mode here.First, we just start it reading.

Then we can loop over calls to copyNextSampleBuffer,and since we've configured it to provide decoded output,we check each output CMSampleBuffer for a CVImageBuffer.We will get some marker CMSampleBuffers with no image buffers, but this is okay.Using an AVAssetReader, you can set time rangesor do other more advanced operationsrather than this simple iteration through the track.Your video pipeline will be most efficientif your renderer is able to consume buffersin a format that is native to the decoder.AVAssetReader will convert the decoder outputfrom the decoder's native format to your requested output formatif you are requesting a format that the decoder does not support.But avoiding these buffer copieswill improve your application efficiency immensely.Here are some guidelines on choosing an output pixel formatthat will not result in a conversion.

In the previous example, we configured the AVAssetReaderOutputto return buffers in 16-bit 4:4:4:4 YCbCr with alpha,or Y416,which is the optimal format when using ProRes 4444.

For ProRes 422, 16-bit 4:2:2 YCbCr, or v216,is the most native decoder format to request.

For ProRes RAW, RGBA half-float, or RGhA, provides the most native output.

Sometimes there's reasonswhy one doesn't want to rely on AVAssetReader to do everything.In these cases, you'll need to generate CMSampleBuffersto feed directly to the Video Toolbox.There are three main options here.First, you can use AVAssetReader, much like we described a moment ago,but you can request that it give you the compressed datawithout decoding it first.This provides track-level media access,with awareness of edits and frame dependencies.

Second, there is AVSampleBufferGenerator.This provides media-level access to samples,with no awareness of edits and frame dependencies.

And finally, you can construct CMSampleBuffers yourself.

Letting AVAssetReader generate your samplesprovides compressed data read directly from the AVAsset.AVAssetReader is doing track-level reading,which means it will provide all samples necessaryto display frames at the target time,including handling edits and frame dependencies.Also, as noted earlier,AVAssetReader will provide samples which are optimized for RPC,reducing sandbox overhead when the frames are sent to the Video Toolbox.

In order to get raw compressed output from the AVAssetReader,you simply need to construct the AVAssetReader as described earlier,but when creating the AVAssetReaderTrackOutput,you'll set the outputSettings to nilrather than providing a dictionary specifying a pixel format.

AVSampleBufferGenerator provides samples read directly from the mediain an AVAssetTrack.It uses an AVSampleBufferCursor to control the position in the trackfrom which it will read media.It has no inherent awareness of frame dependencies,so this may be straightforward to use with ProRes,but care must be taken when using this interfacewith content with inter-frame dependencies,like HEVC and H.264.Here's a brief code snippet showing how an AVSampleBufferGenerator is created.First you need to create an AVSampleCursorwhich will be used for stepping through samples.

You must also create an AVSampleBufferRequestwhich describes the actual sample requests you will be making.

Now you can create the AVSampleBufferGeneratorwith your source AVAsset.

Note that I'm setting the timebase to nil here,which will result in synchronous operation.For optimal performance with AVSampleBufferGenerator,you would provide a timebase and run your requests asynchronously.

Finally, I'm looping over calls to createSampleBufferForRequestand stepping the cursor forward one frame at a time.Again, this shows the simplest possible synchronous operation.For optimal performance, one would use async versions of these requests.Finally, you can create CMSampleBuffers yourselfif you're doing your own file readingor getting sample data from some other source, like the network.It's important to note that this sample datawill not be optimized for transfer over the sandbox RPC.

Earlier, we talked about the components of a CMSampleBuffer.Once again, there's the data in a CMBlockBuffer,a CMFormatDescription, and some timestamps.

So, first you need to pack your sample datain a CMBlockBuffer.

Then you need to create a CMVideoFormatDescriptiondescribing the data.Here it would be important to include the color tagsin your extensionsDictionaryto ensure proper color management for your video.

Next you would create some timestamps in a CMSampleTimingInfo struct.And finally, create a CMSampleBuffer using the CMBlockBuffer,the CMVideoFormatDescription and the CMSampleTimingInfo.

Okay, you've decided to do it yourselfand you've created a source for CMSampleBuffers.On to the Video Toolbox.Let's take a look at the anatomy of a VTDecompressionSession.

The VTDecompressionSession, of course, has a video decoder,and as described earlier,this will be running in a separate sandboxed process.

The session also has a CVPixelBufferPoolwhich is being used to create the output buffersfor decoded video frames.

And finally, if you have requested outputin a format which doesn't match what the decoder can provide,there will be a VTPixelTransferSession to do the required conversion.Before you get started, if your application needs to accessthe set of specialized decoders distributed for Pro video workflows,your application can make a callto VTRegisterProfessional- VideoWorkflowVideoDecoders.This only needs to happen once in your application.The steps to use a VTDecompressionSessionare pretty simple.First, create a VTDecompressionSession.

Second, do any necessary configuration of the VTDecompressionSessionvia VTSessionSetProperty calls.This isn't always needed.

Finally, begin sending frames using callsto VTDecompressionSession- DecodeFrameWithOutputHandler,or simply VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame.

For optimal performance, it's recommended that asynchronous decode be enabledin your DecodeFrame calls.Let's look more closely at creating a VTDecompressionSession.There are three major options that need to be specified.

First is the videoFormatDescription.This tells the VTDecompressionSession what codec will be used,and provides more details about the format of the datain the CMSampleBuffers.This should match the CMVideoFormatDescriptionof the CMSampleBuffers that you are about to send to the session.

Next is the destinationImageBufferAttributes.This describes your output pixelBuffer requirements.This can include dimensionsif you want the Video Toolbox to scale output to a certain size.

It can contain a specific pixelFormat if your rendering engine requires it.If you only know how to consume 8-bit RGB samples,this is where you would request that.

This can also be a high-level directive,like a request to just provide Core Animation-compatible output.

Next is the videoDecoderSpecification,which provides hints about factors for decoder selection.This is where you specify non-default hardware decoder requests.

Speaking of hardware decoder usage,as mentioned earlier, on current OS versions,hardware decoder usage is enabled by defaultfor all formats where it's supported.This is a slight change from a few years ago when it was an opt-in.In current OSes, all hardware-accelerated codecsare available by default with no opt-ins required.If you want to guarantee that your VTDecompressionSessionis created with a hardware decoder,and want session creation to fail if it isn't possible,you can pass in the RequireHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoderspecification option set to true.

Similarly, if you want to disable hardware decodeand use a software decoder,you can include EnableHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoderspecification option set to false.These two keys are awfully similar, so once more,the first key is RequireHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoderand the second is EnableHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoder.This sample shows the basics of VTDecompressionSession creation.The first thing that we need is a formatDescriptionto tell the session what type of data to expect.We pull this straight from a CMSampleBufferthat will be passed to the session later.If we want a specific pixelFormat for our output,we need to create a pixelBufferAttributes dictionarydescribing what we need.So, just like in the earlier AVAssetReader example,we're requesting 16-bit 4:4:4:4 YCbCr with alpha.Now we can create the VTDecompressionSession.Note that we're passing in NULL for the third parameter,the videoDecoderSpecification.This NULL means that the Video Toolboxwill do its default hardware decoder selection.

Once the VTDecompressionSession is created,the calls to DecodeFrame are fairly straightforward.As mentioned earlier, for optimal performance,the kVTDecodeFrame_Enable- AsynchronousDecompression flagshould be set in the decodeFlags.

The block-based VTDecompressionSession- DecodeFrameWithOutputHandlertakes the compressed sampleBuffer,the inFlags, which control decoder behavior,and an output block which will be called with the results of the decode operation.

As long as the VTDecompressionSession- DecodeFrameWithOutputHandler calldoesn't return an error,your output block will be called with the results of the frame decode,either a CVImageBuffer or a decoder error.A quick note about decompression output.Decoder output is serialized.You should only see a single frame being returned from the decoder at a time.If you block inside of the decoder output,it will effectively block subsequent frame outputand ultimately cause back pressure through the decoder.

For best performance, you should make sure that processing and work is doneoutside of your session's output block or callback.

Now let's talk a little bit about using decoded CVPixelBuffers with Metal.Before diving into this,it's important to review exactly how a CVPixelBufferPool works.

As described before,when a CVPixelBuffer which was allocated from a CVPixelBufferPool is released,its IOSurface goes back into the CVPixelBufferPool,and the next time a CVPixelBuffer is allocated from the pool,the IOSurface will be recycled and used for the new CVPixelBuffer.

With this in mind, it's easier to understandthe pitfalls that one can encounter working with CVPixelBuffers and Metal.We need to ensure that IOSurfaces are not recycledwhile still being used by Metal.

There are two main approaches to using CVPixelBuffers with Metal.One is the obvious bridge through IOSurface.The CVPixelBuffer contains an IOSurfaceand Metal knows how to use an IOSurface for texturing.But this path requires a bit of extra care.

The second path is through Core Video's CVMetalTextureCache.This is less obvious, but generally simpler to use in a safe manner,and can provide some performance benefits.

Using the IOSurface backing from a CVPixelBufferdirectly with Metal appears straightforward,but there's a trick to ensuring that the IOSurface is not recycledby the CVPixelBufferPool while it's still in use by Metal.

To go this route, you first need to get the IOSurface from the CVPixelBuffer,and you can then create a Metal texture with that IOSurface.

But you need to ensure that the IOSurfaceis not recycled by the CVPixelBufferPoolwhile it's still in use by Metal.So, we use the IOSurfaceIncrementUseCount call.

To release the IOSurface back into the poolwhen Metal has finished with it,we set up a MTLCommandBuffer completion handlerto run after our CommandBuffer completes,and we decrement the IOSurfaceUseCount here.

Using CVMetalTextureCache to manage the interfacebetween CVPixelBuffer and MetalTexture simplifies things,removing the need to manually track IOSurfaces and IOSurfaceUseCounts.

To use this facility, you need to first create a CVMetalTextureCache.You can specify the Metal device you want to associate with here.

Now you can call CVMetalTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImageto create a CVMetalTexture object associated with your CVPixelBuffer.

And getting the actual Metal texture from the CVMetalTextureCacheis a simple call to CVMetalTextureGetTexture.

And the last thing to keep in mind here is that once again,you must set up a handler on your Metal command buffer completion,or otherwise ensure that Metal is done with the texturebefore you release the CVMetalTexture.

CVMetalTextureCache also saves you from repeating the IOSurface texture bindingwhen IOSurfaces which come from a CVPixelBufferPoolare reused and are seen again, making it a little bit more efficient.

Okay, so we covered a few topics here.We talked about when you will get hardware decode, and how to control it.We talked about how AV Foundation's AVAssetReadercan simply and easily allow you to integrate accelerated video decodingwith your custom rendering pipeline.We talked about how to construct CMSampleBuffersand use them with the Video Toolboxif using AVAssetReader on its own isn't a good fit for your use case.

And finally, we talked about some best practicesaround using CVPixelBuffers with Metal.I hope that what we've discussed todayhelps you make your amazing video app a little bit more amazing.Thanks for watching and have a great WWDC.
