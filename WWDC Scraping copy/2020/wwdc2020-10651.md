the App Store Connect team.So as with every WWDC,we have a ton of exciting new features for you.Today, I'll talk to you about how to use App Store Connectto configure and test App Clipsas well as how to take advantage of new Game Center featureslike Challenges and Recurring Leaderboards.I'm also going to give you some exciting updatesabout both in-app purchases and the App Store Connect API.So, as you heard in the keynote,an App Clip is essentially a small part of your Appthat's discoverable at the moment you need it,and is focused on performing a specific task.From a technical standpoint, an App Clip is simply a binarythat you package alongside your appand runs on device just like an app.The App Clip binary is delivered to the device when it's invoked,and we limit the size of the binaryto make sure the Invocation of the App Clip feels very fast.Now in order to deliver a great App Clip experience,there are a few major areas to think about.First you'll want to beta test your App Clipto make sure you're providing a solid user experience.Then, when you're ready to release your App Clipto the rest of your users,you'll set up App Clip Card Metadatato provide meaningful information to your customersabout what your App Clip does.And finally, you'll need to properly definedomain associations to enable your App Clips to launch.But before we get into these,I want to spend a few minutes talking about a conceptthat's foundational to all of these areas.And that's what an App Clip Invocation isand why it's important.I'll start off with an example of invoking an App Clipfrom Safari.Here, we're on the forestexplorer.org website.The first thing you'll noticeis this banner at the top of the page.We call this the Safari App Clip Banner.It appears when a website is associated with an App Clip.In Safari we invoke the App Clipby tapping the OPEN button in this banner.And this brings up what we call the App Clip Card.This Card contains more information about the App Clipbefore it's launched on the user's device.Tapping the open button on the app the Cardlaunches the App Clip itself.And once your App Clip is running,a link to your full app on the App Storewill briefly appear at the top of the screen.There are many ways to invoke an App Clip.As you just saw an App Clip can be invoked from Safari.But App Clips can also be invoked from Messages,Maps, via NFC tags and QR Codes, and based on a user's location.But no matter how it's invoked,almost every App Clip Invocationwill be associated with an Invocation URL.A simple example of an Invocation URLis a URL of the web page that we just saw in our last example,forestexplorer.org.A second example is a piece of functionalitythat we're introducing to Forest Explorer.Users will be able to use our App Clipto reserve campsites from Apple Maps.Here you see the Invocation URL, camp.forestexplorer.org/reserveand then the ID of the campground for the reservation.Now users will also be able to check into the campsitesthat they reserve by scanning and NFC tag at the campsite.This URL contains the ID of the campgroundalong with the specific campsite number.So the Invocation URL serves two main purposes.The first is when an App Clip is displayed,the Invocation URL is used to determinewhat metadata is shown on the App Clip Card.Then, when the App Clip is launched on the user's devicethe Invocation URL is passed into the App Clip to deep linkthe user into a specific piece of App Clip functionality,similar to how you can deep link into Apps today.So, now that you're a bit more familiarwith how an App Clip is invoked,let's talk about how to deliver and beta test your App Clip.So after you finished developing your App Clip in Xcode,you'll generate a build.This build contains both your appand your App Clip together.An App Clip can not be packaged separately from your full app.The build is then delivered into App Store Connect.You can find the build in the TestFlight viewof App Store Connect.And you'll know that it's a build that contains an App Clipbecause it has an extra row containing the same informationyou're used to seeing with apps, but specific to the App Clip.When you click into the build details for this buildyou'll see a new App Clip Invocation section on the page.From here you can configure up to three Invocation URLsfor your testers to test.To do this you provide a title,which appears in the TestFight Appalong with the Invocation URL itself.Now once the App Clip Invocationshave been configured, clicking savewill make them available to testers immediately.Now let's look at what testers will see.In the App detail view, you'll see a new App Clip section.Here we see a list of App Clip Invocationsthat we just set up in App Store Connect.Tapping the TEST button will launch the App Clipassociated with the current buildand pass the configured Invocation URLinto the App Clip to support deep linking.Now one thing to noteis that TestFlight is the only App Clip Invocation casethat does not show an App Clip Cardbefore launching the App Clip itself.If testers encounter any issues with this App Clip,TestFlight Feedback will be available to collect informationfrom testers just like it is for apps.So once beta testing is complete,it's time to think about the metadatathat will display to your users on the App Clip Card.The App Clip Card contains a header image, a title,a subtitle, and a call to action.Toward the bottom of the Card,you'll also see more information about the full appand a link to the app on the App Store.The App Clip Card is part of the overall App Clip experience.It's easy to get started with App Clipsby setting up a default set of App Clip Card metadatain App Store Connect.In fact, the default metadata is required for all App Clips.And of all the Invocation methodsthat I spoke about earlier,this metadata will only appear when an App Clip is invokedfrom Safari or from Messages.And for many of you,this is all you'll need to set upbefore releasing your App Clip to the world.To configure your default experience in App Store Connect,you'll start on the iOS version page.Here, you'll enter the default experience metadata,including the header image, subtitle,and you'll choose a call to action verb.When you're App Clip is invoked from Safari or from Messages,you'll see this metadata appear on the App Clip Card.Now you might be wondering how Safari knowsthat a web page is associated with your App Clipin order to invoke your default App Clip experience.Well to make this association,you simply include a metatag on the web page itselfwith the name "apple-itunes-app".This is the same tag that's usedfor Safari Smart App banners today.But with an extra attribute for the App Clip,the App Clip bundle ID attributeidentifies which App Clip to associate with this web page.And for your customers who are on iOS 13 and earlierwho can't run App Clips, you can add an app ID attributethat'll link them to your full app on the App Store.And that's how you set up a default App Clip experience.Some of you may want more controlover your App Clip experiences.For example, you may want to set upcustomized App Clip Card metadatafor specific Invocation URLs.You can do this by creating advanced App Clip experiences.Not only can you customize App Clip Card metadatawith advanced experiences,but you can also associate these experienceswith places on Apple Maps.Finally, advanced App Clip experiencessupport all of the Invocation methodsI told you about earlier.So, now let's look at a few examplesof advanced Clip experiences for Forest Explorer.First, is the ability to invokea campsite reservation experience from Apple Maps.When a user taps the button on the Apple Maps place Cardfor this campground,the App Clip Card for this experience will appear.We want this App Clip Cardto display a photo of the campgroundas well as a meaningful title and subtitle.In this case we set the title to "Reserve"and subtitle to the name of the campground.Next let's take a look at the campsite check-in experience.Now campers will be able to check intoour high tech campgrounds by scanning on-site NFC tagsencoded with our campsite check-in URL.Just like the reservation case, we want this experienceto display the campground photo and name,but this time we want the title to say "Check-in."Now looking at the Invocation URL,you'll notice that this URL is specific to each campsite.But we want a single set of metadata to appearfor all campsites.If we register metadata for the URL as you see it,we will need to register the same metadatafor every single site.And this would get repetitive very quickly.So instead,we'll only associate the campground metadatato the first part of the Invocation URL.Any URL beginning with this prefixwill display the same metadata.And now we've configured metadatafor all of the campsites with a single registration.These are just a few waysto configure advanced App Clip experiences.Now I'd like to show you how to set upadvance experiences in App Store Connect.First, we'll head back to the iOS version page.Next, we'll click on the Get Started linkin the Advanced App Clip experiences section.And then we land on this page.We'll get some backgroundon what you'll be asked to providefor the experience you're registering.First, you need to specify the App Clip Invocation URLfor your App Clip experience.In this case I'm going to register the full URLfor the campground reservation experience.Below the URL Is the bundle ID of the App Clip itself.After setting up your URL,it is time to enter the metadata for the App Clip Card.First, we upload metadata that includes the header,image title, and subtitle for this App Clip Card.And after entering the metadata we answer the questionof whether to associate this experiencewith a place in Apple Maps.The campground is represented as a place on Apple Maps,so we select "Yes" for the place selection.Then, we select a Maps Action that best fits the experienceby selecting Open Reserve Room.To complete setting up the place association,we select the campgroundthat we're creating the experience for.In this case, Lakeside Campground.And once we've chosen a place we're asked a few questionsabout the relationship between the App developer and the place.Since Forest Explorer does not own the campgroundbut does have a relationship with the campground,we select "Authorized by Owner" for the relationship.And then in response to what is promoted in this experience,we choose a different business or servicesince we're promoting the campgroundand not Forest Explorer.And generally the answer to what is promotedwill fall into one of two main categories:Your business and Other businesses.Most of you will set up experiencespromoting your own businessbecause your App Clip represents surface offeringsthat your business provides.But some of you will set upexperiences for other businesses.This makes sense when you represent other businesses,for example, the way Yelp does.Notice that the icon that displayswhen the experience represents another businessis a category icon and not the App icon.This icon is displayed in history,the Safari App Clip bannerand other parts of the App Clip Experience.Once you've completed the processof setting up your experience,you'll see all the experiences you've configuredalong with their statuses on the App Clip Experiences page.And that's how you set up advanced App Clip Experiencesin App Store Connect.Now once this is done,it's time to think about domain associations.Every Invocation URL contains a domain.Now we need to make sure you're authorized to use these domainsto invoke your App Clips.To do this, first you specify which domainsyou want to associate with your App Clipsby using the Associated Domains Entitlement.Next, you set up Apple App Site Association filesto be served from those domains.These need to contain a referenceto the App Clip App ID.If everything checks out,then your App Clip can be invoked on device.If you want to check the validation statusof your App Clip,go to the build details page in App Store Connect.From here, click the View Status link in the App Clip section,and this will bring up a modalshowing domain validation status.The cache status column is what drives App Clip Invocationson your customers devices.And if, for example,you're working on your Apple App Site Association file,and you want to find out whether your changes are valid,you can click the Load Debug Status link.By doing this we'll reach out to your servers in real timeand validate the App Clip portions of your file.If there are any issues, you can get more detail here.Now, there's a lot more to learn about associating domains.So for a full walkthrough of the process,be sure to check outthe What's New in Universal Links session.There are also a number of other informative sessionsfocusing on various aspects of App Clipsthat are linked in the resources associated with this session.And that's how you set up App Clips in App Store Connect.Next, I'd like to show you how to use App Store Connectto take advantage of the new featuresin Game Center on iOS 14.First, we have challenges.Now, Challenges enable players to challenge other playersto complete an achievement or to beat a leaderboard score.To enable this feature for your game,go to the Game Center landing page under Features.From there,you click the "Allow challenges in this game" checkbox.Once you save this change,your players will be able to challenge each other.Next, we have Recurring Leaderboards.Recurring Leaderboards are a new kind of leaderboardthat allow you to collect scoresfor a predetermined period of time.Then that period is then scheduled to repeatat specific intervals.As an example,let's say you create a Recurring Leaderboardthat begins for the first time on October 13 at 6:00 pm.It lasts for four hours and repeats every week.This means that scores are posted to this leaderboardbeginning on Tuesday the 13th at 6:00 pm,and the leaderboard continues to collect scores for four hoursuntil 10:00 pm.And every week after the 13th from 6:00 to 10:00 pm,a fresh leaderboard opens up again to take new scores.This is the page where you set up Recurring Leaderboardsin App Store Connect.If you set up leaderboards in the past,most of these fields will look familiar to you.For Recurring Leaderboards, we've just added a start time,a duration, and a fieldwhere you can specify the recurrence rules.We have two additional sessions that coverthe full breadth of new Game Center features,so be sure to check those out.Next, I want to give you an exciting updateabout our subscriptions program.Now Subscriptions are one ofthe fastest growing business models on the App Store.And we know that customers loveour Family Sharing capabilities,which let them share Apple services like Music,Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+,which is why we're so excited to announcethat starting this Fall, Family Sharing for subscriptionswill be available to all App developers.For the first time, everyone in the familycan have access to great subscriptionsfrom the App Store with a single purchase.Family Sharing will be availablefor both autorenewal subscriptionsas well as nonconsumable in-app purchases.Family sharing is flexible enoughto adapt to your different business needs.For example, if you would like to makea Family Shared subscriptionand upgrade from an individual one,you can do just that.When you enable Family Sharing for your subscriptionor nonconsumable in-app purchase,all new customers will automatically share the purchasewith their family.Be sure to update your in-app purchase metadatato appropriately communicate that it is a shared purchase.On the other hand, if you have existing subscribers,those subscribers will need to take an action to opt-into sharing the subscription with their families.To configure Family Sharing in App Store Connect,navigate to the In-App Purchase detail page.Once you arrive here,you'll want to think about your metadatato make sure you're communicatingthat this is a Family Shared in-app purchase.When you're ready to enable Family Sharing,click the Turn On link toward the middle of the page.When you do this we will ask you to confirm your decision.Please consider your decision carefullybecause once you enable Family Sharingfor a live in-app purchase, you cannot turn it off again.Once you confirm, Family Sharing will go into effect immediately.For more information about how to support Family Sharingwith StoreKit along with other updates to StoreKit APIs,watch the What's New in In-App Purchase session.We've also added an exciting set of testing featuresthat includes local testing of in-app purchasesdirectly from within Xcode,and we've made enhancements to the sandbox testing experience.We'll take a deep dive into these featuresin Testing in-App Purchases.And finally, if you want to make the mostof subscription features for your business,you'll want to watch Architecting for Subscriptions.And finally, we'd like to tell youabout our expanded App Store Connect API.Two years ago we launched the App Store Connect APIwith support for TestFlight, User management,Provisioning, and Reporting.Later this year,we're excited to be adding two powerful new sets of APIs.We'll be introducing a suite of App Metadata APIsthat will let you manage your presence on the App Storeas well as a new Power and Performance APIthat'll let you download the same aggregate datathat drives the new power and performance analysis toolsin Xcode.In fact, just between these two new categoriesof API functionality,we're adding over 200 new endpoints.For app metadata, you will be able to do thingslike create new App Store versions,set pricing and availability,edit app and version-level metadata,associate builds to your App Store versions,and submit those versions for review.Now we can't even begin to scratch the surfaceof the new APIs in this session.So be sure to check out the new App Store Connect API sessionfor deep dive into the new APIs and walkthroughsof some common use cases that you may encounter.So we've covered a lot of ground today.We talked about using App Store Connectto configure App Clips and new Game Center featureslike Challenges and Recurring Leaderboards.You'll soon be able to make your subscriptionsFamily Shareable,and we're adding a ton of new functionalityto the App Store Connect API.We're very excited about all of these new features,and we can't wait to see what you'll do with them.Thank you for watching this sessionand please enjoy the rest of your conference.♪

♪Voiceover: Hello, and welcome to WWDC.

Daniel Miao: Hi, everyone.

Welcome to our session on What's New in App Store Connect.

My name is Daniel Miao,and I'm an engineering manager on the App Store Connect team.

So as with every WWDC,we have a ton of exciting new features for you.

Today, I'll talk to you about how to use App Store Connectto configure and test App Clipsas well as how to take advantage of new Game Center featureslike Challenges and Recurring Leaderboards.

I'm also going to give you some exciting updatesabout both in-app purchases and the App Store Connect API.

So, as you heard in the keynote,an App Clip is essentially a small part of your Appthat's discoverable at the moment you need it,and is focused on performing a specific task.

From a technical standpoint, an App Clip is simply a binarythat you package alongside your appand runs on device just like an app.

The App Clip binary is delivered to the device when it's invoked,and we limit the size of the binaryto make sure the Invocation of the App Clip feels very fast.

Now in order to deliver a great App Clip experience,there are a few major areas to think about.

First you'll want to beta test your App Clipto make sure you're providing a solid user experience.

Then, when you're ready to release your App Clipto the rest of your users,you'll set up App Clip Card Metadatato provide meaningful information to your customersabout what your App Clip does.

And finally, you'll need to properly definedomain associations to enable your App Clips to launch.

But before we get into these,I want to spend a few minutes talking about a conceptthat's foundational to all of these areas.

And that's what an App Clip Invocation isand why it's important.

I'll start off with an example of invoking an App Clipfrom Safari.

Here, we're on the forestexplorer.org website.

The first thing you'll noticeis this banner at the top of the page.

We call this the Safari App Clip Banner.

It appears when a website is associated with an App Clip.

In Safari we invoke the App Clipby tapping the OPEN button in this banner.

And this brings up what we call the App Clip Card.

This Card contains more information about the App Clipbefore it's launched on the user's device.

Tapping the open button on the app the Cardlaunches the App Clip itself.

And once your App Clip is running,a link to your full app on the App Storewill briefly appear at the top of the screen.

There are many ways to invoke an App Clip.

As you just saw an App Clip can be invoked from Safari.

But App Clips can also be invoked from Messages,Maps, via NFC tags and QR Codes, and based on a user's location.

But no matter how it's invoked,almost every App Clip Invocationwill be associated with an Invocation URL.

A simple example of an Invocation URLis a URL of the web page that we just saw in our last example,forestexplorer.org.

A second example is a piece of functionalitythat we're introducing to Forest Explorer.

Users will be able to use our App Clipto reserve campsites from Apple Maps.

Here you see the Invocation URL, camp.forestexplorer.org/reserveand then the ID of the campground for the reservation.

Now users will also be able to check into the campsitesthat they reserve by scanning and NFC tag at the campsite.

This URL contains the ID of the campgroundalong with the specific campsite number.

So the Invocation URL serves two main purposes.

The first is when an App Clip is displayed,the Invocation URL is used to determinewhat metadata is shown on the App Clip Card.

Then, when the App Clip is launched on the user's devicethe Invocation URL is passed into the App Clip to deep linkthe user into a specific piece of App Clip functionality,similar to how you can deep link into Apps today.

So, now that you're a bit more familiarwith how an App Clip is invoked,let's talk about how to deliver and beta test your App Clip.

So after you finished developing your App Clip in Xcode,you'll generate a build.

This build contains both your appand your App Clip together.

An App Clip can not be packaged separately from your full app.

The build is then delivered into App Store Connect.

You can find the build in the TestFlight viewof App Store Connect.

And you'll know that it's a build that contains an App Clipbecause it has an extra row containing the same informationyou're used to seeing with apps, but specific to the App Clip.

When you click into the build details for this buildyou'll see a new App Clip Invocation section on the page.

From here you can configure up to three Invocation URLsfor your testers to test.

To do this you provide a title,which appears in the TestFight Appalong with the Invocation URL itself.

Now once the App Clip Invocationshave been configured, clicking savewill make them available to testers immediately.

Now let's look at what testers will see.

In the App detail view, you'll see a new App Clip section.

Here we see a list of App Clip Invocationsthat we just set up in App Store Connect.

Tapping the TEST button will launch the App Clipassociated with the current buildand pass the configured Invocation URLinto the App Clip to support deep linking.

Now one thing to noteis that TestFlight is the only App Clip Invocation casethat does not show an App Clip Cardbefore launching the App Clip itself.

If testers encounter any issues with this App Clip,TestFlight Feedback will be available to collect informationfrom testers just like it is for apps.

So once beta testing is complete,it's time to think about the metadatathat will display to your users on the App Clip Card.

The App Clip Card contains a header image, a title,a subtitle, and a call to action.

Toward the bottom of the Card,you'll also see more information about the full appand a link to the app on the App Store.

The App Clip Card is part of the overall App Clip experience.

It's easy to get started with App Clipsby setting up a default set of App Clip Card metadatain App Store Connect.

In fact, the default metadata is required for all App Clips.

And of all the Invocation methodsthat I spoke about earlier,this metadata will only appear when an App Clip is invokedfrom Safari or from Messages.

And for many of you,this is all you'll need to set upbefore releasing your App Clip to the world.

To configure your default experience in App Store Connect,you'll start on the iOS version page.

Here, you'll enter the default experience metadata,including the header image, subtitle,and you'll choose a call to action verb.

When you're App Clip is invoked from Safari or from Messages,you'll see this metadata appear on the App Clip Card.

Now you might be wondering how Safari knowsthat a web page is associated with your App Clipin order to invoke your default App Clip experience.

Well to make this association,you simply include a metatag on the web page itselfwith the name "apple-itunes-app".

This is the same tag that's usedfor Safari Smart App banners today.

But with an extra attribute for the App Clip,the App Clip bundle ID attributeidentifies which App Clip to associate with this web page.

And for your customers who are on iOS 13 and earlierwho can't run App Clips, you can add an app ID attributethat'll link them to your full app on the App Store.

And that's how you set up a default App Clip experience.

Some of you may want more controlover your App Clip experiences.

For example, you may want to set upcustomized App Clip Card metadatafor specific Invocation URLs.

You can do this by creating advanced App Clip experiences.

Not only can you customize App Clip Card metadatawith advanced experiences,but you can also associate these experienceswith places on Apple Maps.

Finally, advanced App Clip experiencessupport all of the Invocation methodsI told you about earlier.

So, now let's look at a few examplesof advanced Clip experiences for Forest Explorer.

First, is the ability to invokea campsite reservation experience from Apple Maps.

When a user taps the button on the Apple Maps place Cardfor this campground,the App Clip Card for this experience will appear.

We want this App Clip Cardto display a photo of the campgroundas well as a meaningful title and subtitle.

In this case we set the title to "Reserve"and subtitle to the name of the campground.

Next let's take a look at the campsite check-in experience.

Now campers will be able to check intoour high tech campgrounds by scanning on-site NFC tagsencoded with our campsite check-in URL.

Just like the reservation case, we want this experienceto display the campground photo and name,but this time we want the title to say "Check-in."Now looking at the Invocation URL,you'll notice that this URL is specific to each campsite.

But we want a single set of metadata to appearfor all campsites.

If we register metadata for the URL as you see it,we will need to register the same metadatafor every single site.

And this would get repetitive very quickly.

So instead,we'll only associate the campground metadatato the first part of the Invocation URL.

Any URL beginning with this prefixwill display the same metadata.

And now we've configured metadatafor all of the campsites with a single registration.

These are just a few waysto configure advanced App Clip experiences.

Now I'd like to show you how to set upadvance experiences in App Store Connect.

First, we'll head back to the iOS version page.

Next, we'll click on the Get Started linkin the Advanced App Clip experiences section.

And then we land on this page.

We'll get some backgroundon what you'll be asked to providefor the experience you're registering.

First, you need to specify the App Clip Invocation URLfor your App Clip experience.

In this case I'm going to register the full URLfor the campground reservation experience.

Below the URL Is the bundle ID of the App Clip itself.

After setting up your URL,it is time to enter the metadata for the App Clip Card.

First, we upload metadata that includes the header,image title, and subtitle for this App Clip Card.

And after entering the metadata we answer the questionof whether to associate this experiencewith a place in Apple Maps.

The campground is represented as a place on Apple Maps,so we select "Yes" for the place selection.

Then, we select a Maps Action that best fits the experienceby selecting Open Reserve Room.

To complete setting up the place association,we select the campgroundthat we're creating the experience for.

In this case, Lakeside Campground.

And once we've chosen a place we're asked a few questionsabout the relationship between the App developer and the place.

Since Forest Explorer does not own the campgroundbut does have a relationship with the campground,we select "Authorized by Owner" for the relationship.

And then in response to what is promoted in this experience,we choose a different business or servicesince we're promoting the campgroundand not Forest Explorer.

And generally the answer to what is promotedwill fall into one of two main categories:Your business and Other businesses.

Most of you will set up experiencespromoting your own businessbecause your App Clip represents surface offeringsthat your business provides.

But some of you will set upexperiences for other businesses.

This makes sense when you represent other businesses,for example, the way Yelp does.

Notice that the icon that displayswhen the experience represents another businessis a category icon and not the App icon.

This icon is displayed in history,the Safari App Clip bannerand other parts of the App Clip Experience.

Once you've completed the processof setting up your experience,you'll see all the experiences you've configuredalong with their statuses on the App Clip Experiences page.

And that's how you set up advanced App Clip Experiencesin App Store Connect.

Now once this is done,it's time to think about domain associations.

Every Invocation URL contains a domain.

Now we need to make sure you're authorized to use these domainsto invoke your App Clips.

To do this, first you specify which domainsyou want to associate with your App Clipsby using the Associated Domains Entitlement.

Next, you set up Apple App Site Association filesto be served from those domains.

These need to contain a referenceto the App Clip App ID.

If everything checks out,then your App Clip can be invoked on device.

If you want to check the validation statusof your App Clip,go to the build details page in App Store Connect.

From here, click the View Status link in the App Clip section,and this will bring up a modalshowing domain validation status.

The cache status column is what drives App Clip Invocationson your customers devices.

And if, for example,you're working on your Apple App Site Association file,and you want to find out whether your changes are valid,you can click the Load Debug Status link.

By doing this we'll reach out to your servers in real timeand validate the App Clip portions of your file.

If there are any issues, you can get more detail here.

Now, there's a lot more to learn about associating domains.

So for a full walkthrough of the process,be sure to check outthe What's New in Universal Links session.

There are also a number of other informative sessionsfocusing on various aspects of App Clipsthat are linked in the resources associated with this session.

And that's how you set up App Clips in App Store Connect.

Next, I'd like to show you how to use App Store Connectto take advantage of the new featuresin Game Center on iOS 14.

First, we have challenges.

Now, Challenges enable players to challenge other playersto complete an achievement or to beat a leaderboard score.

To enable this feature for your game,go to the Game Center landing page under Features.

From there,you click the "Allow challenges in this game" checkbox.

Once you save this change,your players will be able to challenge each other.

Next, we have Recurring Leaderboards.

Recurring Leaderboards are a new kind of leaderboardthat allow you to collect scoresfor a predetermined period of time.

Then that period is then scheduled to repeatat specific intervals.

As an example,let's say you create a Recurring Leaderboardthat begins for the first time on October 13 at 6:00 pm.

It lasts for four hours and repeats every week.

This means that scores are posted to this leaderboardbeginning on Tuesday the 13th at 6:00 pm,and the leaderboard continues to collect scores for four hoursuntil 10:00 pm.

And every week after the 13th from 6:00 to 10:00 pm,a fresh leaderboard opens up again to take new scores.

This is the page where you set up Recurring Leaderboardsin App Store Connect.

If you set up leaderboards in the past,most of these fields will look familiar to you.

For Recurring Leaderboards, we've just added a start time,a duration, and a fieldwhere you can specify the recurrence rules.

We have two additional sessions that coverthe full breadth of new Game Center features,so be sure to check those out.

Next, I want to give you an exciting updateabout our subscriptions program.

Now Subscriptions are one ofthe fastest growing business models on the App Store.

And we know that customers loveour Family Sharing capabilities,which let them share Apple services like Music,Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+,which is why we're so excited to announcethat starting this Fall, Family Sharing for subscriptionswill be available to all App developers.

For the first time, everyone in the familycan have access to great subscriptionsfrom the App Store with a single purchase.

Family Sharing will be availablefor both autorenewal subscriptionsas well as nonconsumable in-app purchases.

Family sharing is flexible enoughto adapt to your different business needs.

For example, if you would like to makea Family Shared subscriptionand upgrade from an individual one,you can do just that.

When you enable Family Sharing for your subscriptionor nonconsumable in-app purchase,all new customers will automatically share the purchasewith their family.

Be sure to update your in-app purchase metadatato appropriately communicate that it is a shared purchase.

On the other hand, if you have existing subscribers,those subscribers will need to take an action to opt-into sharing the subscription with their families.

To configure Family Sharing in App Store Connect,navigate to the In-App Purchase detail page.

Once you arrive here,you'll want to think about your metadatato make sure you're communicatingthat this is a Family Shared in-app purchase.

When you're ready to enable Family Sharing,click the Turn On link toward the middle of the page.

When you do this we will ask you to confirm your decision.

Please consider your decision carefullybecause once you enable Family Sharingfor a live in-app purchase, you cannot turn it off again.

Once you confirm, Family Sharing will go into effect immediately.

For more information about how to support Family Sharingwith StoreKit along with other updates to StoreKit APIs,watch the What's New in In-App Purchase session.

We've also added an exciting set of testing featuresthat includes local testing of in-app purchasesdirectly from within Xcode,and we've made enhancements to the sandbox testing experience.

We'll take a deep dive into these featuresin Testing in-App Purchases.

And finally, if you want to make the mostof subscription features for your business,you'll want to watch Architecting for Subscriptions.

And finally, we'd like to tell youabout our expanded App Store Connect API.

Two years ago we launched the App Store Connect APIwith support for TestFlight, User management,Provisioning, and Reporting.

Later this year,we're excited to be adding two powerful new sets of APIs.

We'll be introducing a suite of App Metadata APIsthat will let you manage your presence on the App Storeas well as a new Power and Performance APIthat'll let you download the same aggregate datathat drives the new power and performance analysis toolsin Xcode.

In fact, just between these two new categoriesof API functionality,we're adding over 200 new endpoints.

For app metadata, you will be able to do thingslike create new App Store versions,set pricing and availability,edit app and version-level metadata,associate builds to your App Store versions,and submit those versions for review.

Now we can't even begin to scratch the surfaceof the new APIs in this session.

So be sure to check out the new App Store Connect API sessionfor deep dive into the new APIs and walkthroughsof some common use cases that you may encounter.

So we've covered a lot of ground today.

We talked about using App Store Connectto configure App Clips and new Game Center featureslike Challenges and Recurring Leaderboards.

You'll soon be able to make your subscriptionsFamily Shareable,and we're adding a ton of new functionalityto the App Store Connect API.

We're very excited about all of these new features,and we can't wait to see what you'll do with them.

Thank you for watching this sessionand please enjoy the rest of your conference.
