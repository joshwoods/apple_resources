Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC.Hi. My name is Elliot Garner, and in this video,I'm going to be discussing push notifications.Let's begin with an overview of push notifications,what they are and why you might use them.Then, I will be discussing how you can add them to your application.Push notifications allow applications to be engaging and interactive.They provide you the ability to deliver updates to your application in real time.This allows for a more dynamic experiencewhen it comes to updating your application.So, what exactly are the advantagesto adding push notifications to your application?First, they do not require your application to be in the foreground.Push notifications are delivered to your applicationregardless of the app stateand, if necessary, your application will be launched.Push notifications are power-efficientand are a great way to engage with your customers.There are two types of push notifications:Alert notifications and background notifications.Alert notifications allow you to deliver visible alertsthat can be interacted with in ways that your app can customize.Background notifications allow your application to receive runtimewhile it is not in the foreground in order to keep your content up-to-date.Now, let's talk about alert pushes first.Alert pushes allow you to deliver a visible alertto give an update about your application.This alert should be used to inform about new informationthat can be interacted with.This alert does not require your application to be runningand will be displayed regardless of app state.And, most importantly, it's entirely customizable.How the alert looks, and its interact-ability, is up to you.Let's look at how you would begin setting up your applicationfor alert notifications.The first thing you need to do is register for remote notifications.This will register the device for Apple Push Notification system, or APNs,and will return a device token to your application.This token is used to identify the device and lets you target it for notifications.Next, you will need to declare your AppDelegatea UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate.Once you have done that,you will assign your AppDelegate as a delegate of the Notification Center.This will let your application be notified when your alert gets opened.Once you have called registerForRemoteNotifications,you will receive a callback on one of these two methods.If you failed to get a token for the device,didFailToRegisterFor RemoteNotificationsWithErrorwill be called with the error describing why registration failed.If you succeeded in getting a token,you need to send that token to your back end push serverso you can deliver notifications to this device.Let's take a look at an example of that.The device token is delivered to your application as a data object.So, in order to send it to your server, it needs to be converted into a string.You can do that by separating the data into its components,converting those components into a hexadecimal string,and then joining them back together into a single string.You then append that string to your URLQueryto make your fully qualified endpoint.Then, you perform a URLSessionto send that token to your server to register it in your database.Lastly, before the device can receive any notifications,you need to ask for permissions for your application to display alerts.Calling requestAuthorization results in a prompt being displayedasking if your application can display alerts.The result of that decision will be passed to the completionHandlerand is set in device settings.Any successive calls to this methodwill return the status in device settings and will not result in a prompt.As you can see, this function is asking for permissions to display an alert,play a sound, and present a badge on the application icon.Only request authorization in response to an action when there is context.You are much more likely to get permissions with this context.Before discussing how to handle a notification payload,let's look at an example payload.Let's say that you're building an application for a restaurantthat wants to be able to alert users whenever there is a new special.As you can see, this alert is telling usthat the Avocado Bacon Burger is now on sale.Let's step through this payload piece by pieceto make sure that it's understood.First is the aps dictionary.This aps dictionary tells the device how to render the notification.Inside of the aps dictionary is the alert dictionary.This tells the system what text to use for the notification.Inside of that are the title and body fields.The title field is a short stringdescribing the purpose of the notification.This needs to be short and easy to understand.The body field is the full descriptive text of the alert message.Next is the sound field.This field is optionaland should be included when you want the device to play a soundwhen the alert is received.If you wanna use the default sound, simply use default like this.However, you can also provide custom sounds for your application.Next is the badge field.This is an optional field which is used to modify the badge of your app icon.This is an absolute value which will be displayed on the app icon.This value can be modified programmatically,so once the alert has been opened,set this value to zero when handling the notification.Outside of the aps field, you have any custom datathat you might wanna provide alongside the notification.Here, it's telling the application what the special is for today,and how much it costs.Now that we know what our payload looks like,let's examine how to handle receiving a notification.This method is the UNUser NotificationCenterDelegate methodthat is called whenever your notification is opened.This method has a completionHandlerthat must be called before returning from the function.The payload that was delivered to the applicationcan be extracted from the userInfo property of the notification's content.Once you have the payload, parse the datafrom the dictionary representation of the JSON.If the data isn't there as is expected,call the completionHandler before returning.This lets the system knowthat you have finished handling the opening of the notification.Once you have the data, you can perform any updates necessary to your application.You should be opening the part of your application relevant to the alert.In the example of the restaurant, when the alert is tapped,the item is added to the cart and the cart is displayed.Once you're done, call the completionHandlerto tell the system that you finished.And that's it.That's all that you need to do to set up your applicationto handle and receive alert notifications.Now that we've examined implementing alert pushes,let's discuss background pushesand how you can use them in your application.Background pushes are similar to alert pushesbut there are some crucial differences that are important to remember.Background notifications allow your application to fetch datafrom the background upon receiving push notifications.These should be used to keep your application up-to-dateeven if the application isn't running.The system will launch your application and give you necessary runtimein order to perform your background update.However, there are some limitations.The system limits applications to so many background operations a day,and background updates will not be performedif the device is under certain constraints.For example, if the device is in a low battery state.So, what do you need to do in order to set up your applicationto register for and handle receiving background pushes?Like with alert pushes, you need to register your applicationfor remote notificationsin order to obtain a device token for your application.However, unlike alert pushes,you do not need to make your application a UNUserNotificationCenterDelegateor assign it to the UNUserNotificationCenter.That's because the UNUserNotificationCenterDelegateis only used when handling alert notifications.And since background notifications are all that's being implemented here,it's unnecessary.Because registerForRemoteNotifications was called,you still need to handle receiving a device token,and you still need to send that device to your push serverfor your own registration.This is exactly the same as what needs to be done for alert notifications.Now, let's examine the payload for a background notification.As you can see, background notification payloadsare much more simple than alert notifications.The only field required for background notificationsis the content-available field inside of the aps dictionary.This field tells the system that this is a background notificationand that your application should be launched to perform your updates.Just like alert notifications,the outside of the aps dictionary can be used for custom data.Now, let's look at how you would handle a background push.When the device receives any remote notification,didReceiveRemoteNotification is called.Use this method to handle your background notification.This function also has a completionHandler.However, unlike the completionHandler when handling alert notifications,this completionHandler has one parameter.This parameter is an enumwhich tells the system whether your background update failed...received no data...or received new data.This allows the system to be smartabout when to launch your application in the future.So, in the case of the restaurant application,background notifications are being used to fetch the menu every dayin order to make sure its content is up-to-date.If the URL for the current version of the menu fails to be made,call the completionHandler and tell it the background update failed.Once the URL is created, a URLSession needs to be createdin order to fetch the data for today's menu.If no data was received, call the completionHandlerand tell it that the background update finished successfully with no data.Otherwise, now that the updated menu has been fetched,the application can use that data to update its contents.And once that has been finished,the completionHandler can be called to tell the systemthat the background update has succeeded and retrieved new data.And that's all it takes to get your applicationto handle background notifications.Now that you know what push notifications are,how they can be used, and how to implement them,it should be no problem to add them to your application.All that you need to do is enable push notifications in the developer portaland follow these steps to add push notifications to your application.Download the sample app.It has all of the codes shown in this video.Look through it, and use it as a jumping-off pointfor adding notifications to your apps.Once you have done these things,you are well on your way to creating an enriched experience for your applications.Thank you.

Hello and welcome to WWDC.

Hi. My name is Elliot Garner, and in this video,I'm going to be discussing push notifications.Let's begin with an overview of push notifications,what they are and why you might use them.Then, I will be discussing how you can add them to your application.

Push notifications allow applications to be engaging and interactive.They provide you the ability to deliver updates to your application in real time.

Push notifications are power-efficientand are a great way to engage with your customers.There are two types of push notifications:Alert notifications and background notifications.Alert notifications allow you to deliver visible alertsthat can be interacted with in ways that your app can customize.

Now that we've examined implementing alert pushes,let's discuss background pushesand how you can use them in your application.Background pushes are similar to alert pushesbut there are some crucial differences that are important to remember.

Background notifications allow your application to fetch datafrom the background upon receiving push notifications.

These should be used to keep your application up-to-dateeven if the application isn't running.The system will launch your application and give you necessary runtimein order to perform your background update.However, there are some limitations.The system limits applications to so many background operations a day,and background updates will not be performedif the device is under certain constraints.For example, if the device is in a low battery state.

So, what do you need to do in order to set up your applicationto register for and handle receiving background pushes?Like with alert pushes, you need to register your applicationfor remote notificationsin order to obtain a device token for your application.

When the device receives any remote notification,didReceiveRemoteNotification is called.

Use this method to handle your background notification.

This function also has a completionHandler.However, unlike the completionHandler when handling alert notifications,this completionHandler has one parameter.

This parameter is an enumwhich tells the system whether your background update failed...received no data...or received new data.

This allows the system to be smartabout when to launch your application in the future.

So, in the case of the restaurant application,background notifications are being used to fetch the menu every dayin order to make sure its content is up-to-date.

If the URL for the current version of the menu fails to be made,call the completionHandler and tell it the background update failed.

Once the URL is created, a URLSession needs to be createdin order to fetch the data for today's menu.

If no data was received, call the completionHandlerand tell it that the background update finished successfully with no data.

Otherwise, now that the updated menu has been fetched,the application can use that data to update its contents.And once that has been finished,the completionHandler can be called to tell the systemthat the background update has succeeded and retrieved new data.

And that's all it takes to get your applicationto handle background notifications.

Now that you know what push notifications are,how they can be used, and how to implement them,it should be no problem to add them to your application.
