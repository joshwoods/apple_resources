Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC.Hello, my name is Ashish,and I'm a performance tools engineer at Apple.Yeounoh will join me later,and we are very excited to talk to you about the new App Store Connect APIfor obtaining power and performance data.The amazing work done by developers in building great applicationsis an essential part of our users' overall software experience.And two of the most important aspects of ensuring a great user experienceare optimizing the power and performance impactof your applications.At Apple, we are deeply committed towards providing you actionable toolsto help you easily identify the areas to focus on.Last year at WWDC 2019,we first introduced a new feature within Xcode 11for out-of-the-box power and performance analytics.The Xcode Organizer allows you to viewaggregated power, performance and I/O metricsto help identify areas for improvements in your applications.Since that release, we have received many requeststo be able to access the same Xcode data programmatically.One of the common requests we heardwas the ability to consume this datain your own analytics and monitoring pipelines.So, we are very excited to announce the new Power and Performance APIwhich is part of the App Store Connect API being released later this year.We highly recommend you to check outthe "Expanding Automation with the App Store Connect API" videoto learn more about App Store Connect.The new API enables you to programmatically accessthe Xcode metrics and diagnostics data,allowing you to consume this data yourself.We've also provided a new built-in smart insights featureto identify your application's power and performance hotspotswithout any additional effort.As people use your application,we collect the power and performance data from consented devices.This data is then aggregated on our serversand made available to you through the App Store Connect API.You can use data from this new APIfor building highly customized analytics pipelines,as well as automated monitoring of your app's performancethrough dashboards.During the rest of this talk,we'll first go through a brief overview of this new APIand the data types vended by it.Next, we'll walk through a few examples of accessing the same aggregated datathat drives the power and performance analytics in Xcode,as well as the new smart insights.Finally, we'll present a live demoto extract aggregated metrics, insights and diagnosticsfor a sample application and wrap up with a brief summary.Now, let's walk through an overview of this API.There are four new REST API resources available this year.Let's take a look at each resource.The first API resource uses your application's IDto provide aggregated metrics and insights for your app's most recent versions.The smart insights help identify your application's hotspots.We'll go into more details of this data in the next section.The second API resourceallows you to download metrics for a specific app version.To get this data, you'll need to provide the build IDprovided by App Store Connect API for a specific application version.Next, you can access top diagnostic signaturesfor a specific app version.These signatures are used to group common problems.We also recommend you check outthis year's talk on Xcode Organizer,which goes into details about accessingthe same diagnostics data through Xcode.Finally, you can download logscorresponding to diagnostic signatures for your root cause analysis.This requires the diagnostic signature ID as part of the GET request.To summarize the new API,you can incorporate these four endpoints into your analytics workflowsto automatically track your application's footprintusing aggregated metrics, smart insights and diagnostics data.Now, let's walk through a few examplesto get data and insights through these API endpoints,starting with aggregated metrics data.The power and performance metrics data for an applicationis aggregated by each unique metric and device type.These metrics are the same as those available in Xcode Organizer today,such as battery drain, launch and disk writes.The new API currently supports vending this datafor all iPhone and iPad device groups.As discussed earlier, you need to make the following GET requestwith your application IDto receive both aggregated metricsand insights for your recent app versions.This returns a structured JSON string with two major sections:aggregated metrics, which is represented as productData, and insights.Let's take a look at the sample metrics JSON.For each metric, such as hangRate,the JSON structure contains some metadata, such as unit.And for each unique device and metric combination,the JSON contains the 50th and 90th percentile values.Finally, the metric summary is generatedfor up to eight most recent versions of the application.As this example JSON indicates, you can use this datato build highly customized power and performance analyticsacross different metrics, devices and percentiles.But we didn't stop here.Our team went one step furtherto also help you quickly identifyyour application's power and performance hotspotswithout the need for custom analytics.We are very excited to bring you the new smart insights feature.These smart insights use the earlier metrics datato automatically flag major hotspots in your application.This is especially helpful if you want to tracktop application regressions in the field without any additional effort.Currently, these insights flag regressions and uptick in metric values.The insights JSON response contains three sections:the versions analyzed for the insight, a summary of the regression,and a list of impacted devices and percentiles.Let's walk through the details of a sample insight.The highlighted section indicates the metric typeand summary of the identified regression.You can use these summary stringsto track top regressions for your application.As shown here, the application's launch time is regressedonly for the 90th percentile iPhone users.Such insights can help you take more focused actionsto improve your app's performance.The population sectioncontains a detailed structure list of impacted percentiles and devices.And the third part contains the metadata,such as the latest application version,and the list of previous application versions used for comparison.In the final part of this section,let's take a look at diagnostics data for root cause analysis.Over to Yeounoh now to continue the rest of the talk.Thank you, Ashish.Hi, I'm Yeounoh, a performance tools engineer at Apple.In addition to metrics and smart insights,we also provide diagnostics datato help you deep-dive into regressions.There are two parts to power and performance diagnostics.First, we use diagnostic signatures to group similar problems together.For instance, similar disk writes exceptionsare aggregated to generate disk writes signatures.Using diagnostic signatures,we can do root cause analysis by problem group.The API returns most prevalent top signatures for your app version,and given a top signature and its ID,you can get related diagnostic logs with more details.To receive top signatures for your app version,you need to make following GET request with build IDfrom App Store Connect API.This year, you can access disk writes diagnosticSignaturesfrom both Xcode and the API.The response contains a list of top signatures in data,and each signature contains a unique signature ID and attributes.From these attributes,you can tell that this is an example of a disk writes signature,and the signature stringis the call frame that represents the call stack in Xcode UI.And weight is the normalized signature weightwhich indicates the relative importance of this signature.And it also comes with a URL to get diagnostic logs.As you can see, this URL already contains the signature ID.The second part of power and performance diagnosticsis diagnostic log.It contains anonymized diagnostic details from individual devices.And this includes metadata information, such as platform,OS version and device type.And also, the log contains function call stack trees,which can be extremely helpfulto understand what is causing the power and performance hotspots.The diagnostic call stack JSON structure is also shared with MetricKit.So check out this year's MetricKit talkto learn more about on-device power and performance diagnostics.Getting diagnostic logs requires the following GET requestwith a signature ID.This is the same kind of URLthat we have seen from the diagnosticSignature response.The response contains a list of diagnosticLogs,and each log contains diagnosticMetadatawith information like deviceType, osVersion and buildVersion.In this example, the log is generated for a disk writes exception event.The log also comes with callStacks.Each callStack frame contains rawFrameand parsed frame information,and a list of subFrames.Following the subFrames from the root frame,you can traverse the entire call stack tree structure.Now, let's jump into a demo.In this demo, you will see how to access the API yourself,as well as using a sample scriptthat will be released with the API later this year.For the purpose of this demo,let's assume that I'm a developer for an app called MealPlanner.This app helps me plan meals and save recipes.In the latest release, we introduced a new featureto save delicious photos with entries.And now, I can use Power and Performance APIto make sure that app users don't experience any regression.To access the API, we first need to generate an API access token.I will run a script to generate the tokenusing an App Store Connect API key.With the token, I can access perfPowerMetrics resourcewith MealPlanner app ID.As you can see in this response, we get insights, as well as productData,in the same format that we have seen during the talk.And productData contains a lot of aggregated metrics information.So, let's go look at smart insights to see if we have any regression.Taking insights regression and its summary string,we see that there is a disk writes regressionfor the latest app version for 50th percentile users on all iPhones.To further investigate this, let's get diagnostics logsand look at exception call stacks.First, I will request top diagnosticSignaturesusing the latest app version build ID.By taking the top disk writes signature and its related URL...I will request diagnosticLogs for the signature.The diagnosticLog response contains callStack information...and this call stack structure is efficient for machine processing.And for us to look at the original call stack,I've written a sample codeto parse and pretty-print this stack information.The sample script programmatically accessthe same diagnostic API resources.Hit Enter, we get the original call stack from the log.Looking at the call function frames from the bottom...I see that the new feature to add photos with the entriesis causing heavy disk writes I/O.By following the stack trace,I can go to the exact location in the source codeto debug and optimize the implementation.The sample codes to generate a token, as well as to get diagnostics datawill be released with the API later this year.So, please check out the sample codes for a quick reference to API access.To summarize this demo,you can view and monitor aggregated metrics using the API,and use smart insights to identify power and performance regression.And finally, use diagnostics datato do root cause analysis of the problem.Let's recap what we have discussed today.We introduced our new App Store Connect APIfor power and performance.With this new API, you can programmatically accessthe same metrics and diagnostics data as Xcode Organizer,and build customized data analytics and monitoring systemsaround power and performance metrics.We also introduced smart insightsthat can help you identify key trends and regression in metrics.We are very excited about this new APIfor you to continue building amazing apps.So, we kindly ask you to try it out
and give us your feedback. Thank you.
