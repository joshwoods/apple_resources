Design for intelligence: Meet people where they areUnderstand what motivates people to use your app — and how you can use system intelligence to help them and achieve your own goals as a developer. We'll take a look at a typical person's journey to better understand how an app can become a key part of their routine — and why some apps just don't stick. Learn how you can provide the right kind of value at the right time to help them in their everyday tasks, and how your app and the system can evolve alongside them.ResourcesHD VideoSD VideoRelated VideosWWDC20Add configuration and intelligence to your widgetsBroaden your reach with Siri Event SuggestionsCreate quick interactions with Shortcuts on watchOSDecipher and deal with common Siri errorsDesign for intelligence: Apps, evolvedDesign for intelligence: Discover new opportunitiesDesign for intelligence: Make friends with "The System"Design high quality Siri media interactionsEmpower your intentsEvaluate and optimize voice interaction for your appExpand your SiriKit Media Intents to more platformsFeature your actions in the Shortcuts appIntegrate your app with Wind DownWhat's new in SiriKit and Shortcuts

Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC.Hi, my name is Radhika, and I work on the Proactive Intelligence team here at Apple.As JP just mentioned in the previous video,it's clear that the intelligent system experienceprovides a lot of value for the developer.Now, we'll look at how this benefits users.To do this, let's walk through how system intelligencecan actually help people, even before they download an app,and how it can help through every step of the wayfrom someone who's just starting to use an appto becoming a power user.To illustrate this, we'll use something relatable,like breaking up the workweek by doing some exercise.I'll tell this story from the perspective of someone that's just starting to learnhow to take advantage of all the cool stuff on their phone.Let's say this person always works out with a friend.That friend might text themwith the address of a new gym they're going to today.And before they even type the address in Maps,there's a suggestion to get driving directions to that gymthat's just a tap away right there in Maps.So again, no gym app installed yet,but Maps is smart enough to pick up on the location of the gym from Messages.Pretty cool, right?Let's say she arrives with her friend at this gymand they decide they want to do a workout class together.They don't really know what classes are available at this gym,so they're looking for the gym's class schedule.Starting with iOS 14, there'll be an App Clip for that.She could walk past the same reception desk every day,but this time, there could be an NFC tag for an App Clip at the register.By just holding her phone close to the tag,she could see the schedule just like it would appear in the gym's appbut without needing to hunt down and download something.What's really cool is that if she finds this particular App Clip useful,there's a way to download the full app right there.Now, this imaginary gym rat has gone from going to the gym without an appto realizing how the App Clip can help her plan out her week.In fact, she might want to start picking the day she wants to go to the gymbased on what classes are scheduled.So, she ends up downloading the app.Now, she's starting to plan ahead.Discovering this app helped her solve a problemshe didn't even know she had.Our new app user is now being far more proactivein building healthy habits and creating an intentional schedule.She's started planning out her week on Sunday mornings,which is a very responsible thing to do.In fact, she's gotten even faster at opening her appsby pulling down to reveal Search.And lo and behold, when she pulls down, even before she starts typing,the app is waiting for her right there in Siri Suggestions.That's because Siri can actually learn and predictwhat app she wants to launch based on how she uses her phone.So, she has the app on her device,and she's starting to use the various features within the app,like looking at the yoga schedule and finding new classes she can try out.She's pretty familiar with the app,and can get to the information she needs most of the time.She's really into yoga.So even though she has her week planned,she's always trying to squeeze in an extra yoga class.She usually checks the yoga schedule after work by going into the app,but recently, she's been using the timely shortcut suggestions.She can jump right to the yoga schedule by tapping on it in Search.It ends up saving her a couple of steps, and most importantly,she can probably get in some extra yoga time.So, our friend is now pretty accustomed with the appand is really loving her new gym routine.There have been some hiccups, though,so she's looking for ways to make things even easier for herself.She ended up missing a group class recentlybecause she didn't notice a schedule update.With a busy workweek, she didn't end up checking the app frequently enough.Luckily, this year, with the new widgets,there's an intelligent experience available right on her Home Screen.With a few quick taps,she can create a Smart Stack with all her favorite widgets,including Mission Gym, and add it to her Home Screen.Thanks to system intelligence, the stack will rotate automaticallyto show the most relevant and timely widget.So, in her case, if the class schedule changes,the stack will automatically rotate to the gym widget,giving her enough time to react to any changes.This way she'll never miss a class.More importantly, in the future,she can browse upcoming class times directly on her Home Screenby glancing at the widget and picking a time that works for her.If she wants to learn more,she can always tap on the widget to jump to the right place in the app.So instead of looking for the app and then navigating through it,she can find everything right on her Home Screen.Our friend has been working out pretty frequently now.She did notice, however, she has been repeating the same few thingsright before she works out.She always checks the bus schedule before starting the workout,and she uses the Mission Gym app to track her exercise.This is where Shortcuts is bound to come in handy.She can set up a Shortcut automation that will run when she arrives at the gym.So when she gets there,she can see the bus schedule and start her workout.So, as you can see through this user's journey,system intelligence can help people discover new appsand accelerate them every step of the way after that.By leveraging these intelligence touch points,you can work with the systemto deliver better, more holistic experience for your usersat the right time and place.Now, I'm going to hand it over to my colleague Sufiyanwho will talk about the underlying technologiesthat power all of these experiences.[chimes]

Hi, my name is Radhika, and I work on the Proactive Intelligence team here at Apple.As JP just mentioned in the previous video,it's clear that the intelligent system experienceprovides a lot of value for the developer.Now, we'll look at how this benefits users.

To do this, let's walk through how system intelligencecan actually help people, even before they download an app,and how it can help through every step of the wayfrom someone who's just starting to use an appto becoming a power user.

To illustrate this, we'll use something relatable,like breaking up the workweek by doing some exercise.I'll tell this story from the perspective of someone that's just starting to learnhow to take advantage of all the cool stuff on their phone.Let's say this person always works out with a friend.

That friend might text themwith the address of a new gym they're going to today.

And before they even type the address in Maps,there's a suggestion to get driving directions to that gymthat's just a tap away right there in Maps.

So again, no gym app installed yet,but Maps is smart enough to pick up on the location of the gym from Messages.Pretty cool, right?Let's say she arrives with her friend at this gymand they decide they want to do a workout class together.They don't really know what classes are available at this gym,so they're looking for the gym's class schedule.Starting with iOS 14, there'll be an App Clip for that.
