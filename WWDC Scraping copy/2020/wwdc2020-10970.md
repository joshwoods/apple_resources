a very needed conversation.LISA JACKSON: Something we can no longer avoid andthat we shouldn't avoid.ERIC HOLDER: I think that's just, you know,that's the beginning.We have to have the conversation but then wehave to use that conversation and thatnecessary interaction to come up with concretesteps to take us to that better place, changepolicies, put in place measures that willalleviate the unfairness, the injustice that stillexists in this country.LISA JACKSON: So, that's - that's interesting.Let's talk about policy because I know you're anexpert on the police system.You were our nation's top law enforcement officialand so much of your career centered on lawenforcement at all levels.How do you contextualize the fight for justice withthe glaring injustices we're seeing carriedout by police?And what do you see from a policy perspective aboutmoving forward?ERIC HOLDER: Well, firstly, I think peopleneed to understand that you know, people findracism in the criminal justice system.Well, that shouldn't be shocking.We are still a nation that is dealing with racismthroughout our society.And so, if you look at any component of that society,you would expect to find racism.Now, that's particularly troublesome when it comesto the criminal justice system where property,where life can be taken by the state.And so, you want to make sure that we have asneutral a system as we possibly can.I mean, there are concrete steps that can be taken.We need to, you know, ban chokeholds.We need to have better training.We need to be better in our selection of whoserves as police officers.We can investigate police departments.All of those things are important, extremelyimportant, but we've really got to deal withthose larger societal issues if we want to moveour criminal justice system to a better place.And that gets back, again, to facing our history anddealing with these larger issues, the fact that wedon't have an educational system that works foreverybody in this country, that fair employment isnot necessarily something that everybody enjoyshere, that housing in the United States of Americais not necessarily made available to everybody onan equal basis.You have to deal with these core issues inaddition to dealing with those things that aremanifest in the criminal justice system if we wantto get to that better place.LISA JACKSON: To these systemic issues, the onesthat are sort of embedded in how we run and how welive our daily lives.ERIC HOLDER: Exactly.I mean, it's - you can't divorce the criminaljustice system from the society that it is apart of.And you know, this sounds like a daunting task, youknow, talking about systemic changes of thingsthat have been in place for hundreds of years, butat the end of the day, we're talking aboutmanmade problems that are susceptible to manmade andwomanmade solutions.And that's what makes me relatively, you know,relatively confident here.We've got this new awakening.We've got people in the streets.We have a new level of civic engagement, a newlevel of interest, a new willingness, I think, toconfront those hard issues.If we can maintain this, this moment that we havecan be turned into a movement.So, that's what I think can be done.I think it's going to probably be led by youngpeople as social change in the past has tended tobe as well.So, as I said, I'm cautiously - cautiously optimistic.LISA JACKSON: Now, you know, Apple just announcedour new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.So, at the heart of it is Apple using our platforms,our voice, our resources to challenge systemic racism.I know a lot of times, inequalities are hiddenin the system.They're not always directly able to be seen.Can you share some examples of how this hasshown up maybe in your own life or in your career,the inequities you've seen?ERIC HOLDER: Well, as an African American man inthe United States of America, you know, we allhave stories, you know, that we can tell.I remember going to run to a movie in Georgetownwhich is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., very richneighborhood, a predominantly white neighborhood.It was evening, dark, so I was running to a moviealong with my cousin.Stopped by the police because they saw two Blackmen running in a white neighborhood and assumedthat something must have gone wrong here.It must be something inappropriate.Stopped us, put the spotlight on us, asked uswhat were we doing.I said well, you know, going to see a movie.What they didn't understand, the policeofficer didn't understand is that they had stoppedmy cousin, a Vietnam veteran and me.At the time, I was a federal prosecutor.I was an employee of the United States Departmentof Justice who worked with police officers and FBI agents.But they didn't see that.They just saw two Black guys and so you know, a story.And you know, my story is not different than othersthat - other Black men - that other Black men can share.So, that's, you know, a very visible, personal thing.But then there are systemic things that tendto be a little more hidden.When you look at the ways in which people arerefused mortgages - red lining is what we call itin the United States.You know, areas are forbidden.Certain areas are forbidden for people ofcolor to locate in.So, you go to a bank, you fill out an application,and your application is rejected.You don't really know why but it's aresult of discrimination.We've brought lawsuits against banks when I wasthe Attorney General to stop, you know, to stop that practice.If you look at the Fortune 500, if you look at lawfirms, people of color are simply not represented tothe degree that you would expect as leadersof those organizations.And these are people who are, you know, there aresignificant numbers of people of color who arequalified, who should have opportunities to lead, butthey simply don't get those opportunities and asa result, we have again, these silent barriers,these silent glass ceilings that keep peopleaway from positions of leadership that theyotherwise should have.LISA JACKSON: Yeah.When I'm explaining it to people, I sometimes remindthem of something I'm sure you heard from yourparents, which is my mother and father used tosay, you have to be three times as good to get youknow, a third as much.So, I think, you know, this idea of striving.We're not afraid of doing the work but if the systemis stacked against you, it leads to frustration.It leads to anger.ERIC HOLDER: Yeah.You know, it's interesting because I've heard certainpeople say it's an exhausting thing to be anAfrican American and have to deal with thesestereotypes, to deal with the prejudice, to dealwith the discrimination.And I thought to myself, you know what?It really isn't exhausting because we train for thisfrom the day that we leave the womb.It's something that on a day to day basis,we get used to.It's something that we - it's almost like trainingfor a marathon. You know?Day after day after day, you have to put up with this.You have to figure out ways in which youdeal with it.And after a while, it becomes almost unconscious.It's just kind of the way you think that you have tolead your life.But you know, if you're a person of color and youcan imagine a world where you wouldn't have to dealwith all of those things, boy, it would be a muchbetter existence.And I think that hidden - that hidden thing that wehave to deal with really does have a perniciouseffect both on our psyche and I think researchshows, on our bodies as well.High levels of tension that leads to all kinds ofhealth problems.But again, it's not something that you'reconscious of on a day to day basis because you dealwith it all the time and you just accept it,unfortunately, for the way life has to be.And that - that has to change.LISA JACKSON: You know, I'm going to change thesubject a little bit.I'm going to let that sit there for a second butthen I'm going to change the subject just a bit.I was thinking back on the drive this morning, toinauguration day in 2009.You and I, we were next to each other with ourspouses that morning.The weight of history, the pageant of it all.We were both the first Black heads of ourrespective cabinet agencies.I am immensely proud of that.I always say I was the first Black EPAAdministrator for the first Black president.But it says something about our country and ourprogress or lack thereof.Is it something you think about and you know, howdoes that hit you?ERIC HOLDER: Yeah.I mean, it's certainly something thatI thought about then.It's certainly something I reflect on now.It's clear.I wasn't the first Black lawyer who was qualifiedto be Attorney General of the United States.I mean, I'm very grateful for the fact that I wasgiven that opportunity.I hope I did a good job.You know, there's kind of a dual pressure that youfeel being the first.You don't want to disappoint people who havesacrificed and supported you and made it possiblefor you to become the first head of the EPA, thefirst head of the Justice Department.People sacrificed.People died.People committed themselves so that other -next generations would have opportunities towhich they were denied.And so, there's that pressure.Then there's also that pressure that you want tomake sure that you perform for the larger world andso that the stereotypes of lack of ability, of lackof performance, you dispel those and you feel thatpressure as well.You know, it's - it's a lot of this stuff is aboutpressure, as I talked about before.But again, you know, given those opportunities, Ithink I felt and I'm sure you felt a real duty toperform as best we could, to move the needle, toopen the doors for people who would come - who wouldcome after us.You know, it was great to serve with you, to servewith President Obama.I remember that day in 2009 and the hope that Ifelt and I think the hope that the nation felt.I think actually, the hope that the world felt.And I think, you know, we had a good eight-year run.There have been some reversals since thatperiod of time but I think as I said, the UnitedStates, and I think the world, is really on theverge of a new era, a new and better era.LISA JACKSON: One thing we worked on together wasenvironmental racism or to fight environmentalracism, to bring about environmental justice.And you know, if we're talking, environment isgoing to come up.We know that communities of color aredisproportionately impacted by a range ofenvironmental ills, whether it's climatechange, air quality, water quality, drinking waterquality, land use decisions about what landwe are even able to - to consider developing interms of housing or schools.Is there space for an issue like that in theconversations that we're having in this moment?ERIC HOLDER: Oh, there's not onlyspace for that.That is a necessary part of the conversation.We're really talking about life and death issues there.I mean, we can put in place all kinds of newstructures, change attitudes, makeopportunities available, but you need to havepeople live and live in a way that enables them touse the God-given talents that they have.I mean, we have seen, you know, the negative impactsof environmental racism shortening lives,negatively impacting lives, curtailing peoples'ability to reach all that they are capable of doing.Environmental racism is something that I think fortoo long has not been front and centerand needs to be.I mean, it has to be because you're talkingabout you know, the way in which a society treats,you know, its people.And locating things next to communities of colorthat are going to cause high rates of cancer, highrates of asthma, you know, the kinds of things thatcurtail, again, peoples' abilities.These are the kinds of things that people ingovernment have to stop, that societies have to saythis is unacceptable, and we have to be, I think,more conscious of our environment and the impactthat environment has on all of our people.LISA JACKSON: So agree.I even like to point out to younger people, eventhe roads we're driving on oftentimes cut a swathright through the heart of Black prosperity and theBlack community.I grew up in New Orleans where Claiborne Avenuebecame an underpass, right?And it has a huge impact.So, New Orleans.I'm also going to talk about music.It is Black Music Month.I know music is in your blood as well.We just celebrated Friday, Juneteenth.We talked about Black music as the soundtrackfor protest and you're no stranger to protests.You were even on the ground with activists inFerguson, Missouri.What has been the soundtrack of yourstruggles through the years?And follow-up question; what's the music that'sgiving you life right now?ERIC HOLDER: Well, when I think about protests andmusic that I like, there is one album.What's Going On, Marvin Gaye, 1971-1972.It was a great album then.I think it's the greatest album that's ever been made.With, you know, all due respect to the Beatles andother artists.It was great back in the early 70's and it stillresonates in the 21st Century.You know, What's Going On.You listen to Marvin sing in that song, over thecourse of that whole album, you know, both sides.It's - he talks about the problems that heconfronted, his brother confronted in Vietnam, butit speaks also to issues that we have herein the 21st Century.You know, and so, I still listen to that.I still love that.But now, you know, it's interesting.You know, what am I listening to now?I mean, 21st Century, this is a turbulent time and Ilook for peace in my music and so I've gone back.I'm kind of hanging out in the 70's.So, Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, Aretha Franklin,Earth, Wind, and Fire, the Stylistics.All - this is the music of my youth.A turbulent time but a time that we got through,a time that gives me hope, makes me think that youknow, as turbulent as the late 60's and early 70'swere, we got through it and we made a better America.We have turbulent times now in the early part ofthe 21st Century and again, I'm cautiously optimistic.I think we'll get through it again and music helpsme have that optimism.LISA JACKSON: Yeah. Me too.I'm going to bump Living Just Enough for the Cityup on that playlist too.I always - Innervisions.I think that's the reason I actually became anenvironmentalist, listening to the story ofthis brother getting off the bus in New York andwhat happened to him, you know, in those decades after.ERIC HOLDER: If you look at What's Going On,you've got to remember Mercy, Mercy Me, the Ecology.I mean, Marvin covered everything, you know?He covered protests, demonstrations, Vietnam,the Ecology.It's a - it's a masterpiece.LISA JACKSON: It is. It is.Alright, let me take it to the tech community.This is a wonderful audience listening to us,dynamic, talented developers who - who areinterested in this fight, interested in the fightfor change, and I've heard from so many people acrossApple, throughout our network, who are lookingfor ways to help.What are some ways that tech and developers, appdevelopers specifically, can help tackle racism inthe work that they do every day?ERIC HOLDER: Well, tell you, you know, thisis an unbelievably creative community and Ithink using the skills that you have to - toaggregate, to massage, to work with data and then toshare information, I think that's - I mean, that'sthe core of what it is that developers do, Ithink, at their best, you know, simplifying things,making things accessible to people around the world.So, I would say that you know, I am not as creativenor technically proficient as people are in thisaudience, but using those - those skills, thosereally special skills to come up with ways in whichyou make available to people the possibilitiesthat they have, opportunities with regardto how they can make their lives better,opportunities in which they can you know, monitorthings that are being done in their societies, waysin which the information can be shared across borders.This is all the kinds of stuff that you all do soextremely well.I would ask you to think, you know, about maybeturning your focus from the things that are moretraditionally have been expected of you and thinkabout new ways that you can look at this, thisother frontier, this racial frontier that isnot only in the United States but in othercountries as well, and think about ways in whichyou can focus that creativity, those skillson this problem of race and ethnic strife.What are the things that you can do there that canalleviate those problems?I'm really confident.Again, if this community focuses on those issues,coupled with great companies like Apple, youall could have a really meaningful impact for thegood on the issues that we have been discussing.LISA JACKSON: Alright.We will take that.Eric, it is always such an honor to talk to you, suchtime well spent, so much to take away fromour time together.I just want to thank you so much for joining us,for all you do, for all you've been in service toequality to our community.Just huge thank you.And thanks to all of you for tuning in.Enjoy the rest of Dub-Dub.

LISA JACKSON: Hi.

I'm Lisa Jackson and I lead Environment, Policy,and Social Initiatives for Apple.

Thank you so much for joining us for today'sWWDC conversation on race in America.

I am so honored to be here today and beyond excitedto be joined by my dear friend and former cabinetcolleague, former Attorney General of the UnitedStates, Eric Holder.

Now, before we get started, I want to say afew things about Eric.There's the obvious.

He was the very first Black Attorney General ofthe United States and one of the longest servingAGs, a tough job in a tough town.

He came to the administration with aremarkable record as a successful attorney bothin government and in the private sector.But the most notable attribute I want to callout is his unwavering commitment to equal justice.

In fact, Time Magazine noted this when they namedhim to their list of one hundred mostinfluential people.And that's a big part of what we're going totalk about today.

So, Eric, welcome to your first Dub-Dub.

Thanks for being here.ERIC HOLDER: Well, thanks for having me, Lisa.It's always good to see you.LISA JACKSON: Now, s we're talking aboutjustice now in a time where we're surroundedby gripping and painful reminders thatthe fight continues.For many of us, this has been a reality of our life.But for others, this seems to be a new realization.

So, what do you make of what feels like anall-time high in public awareness around thisset of issues?ERIC HOLDER: Well, you know, I think we're in thethroes of a generational racial awakening.I think that these happen every so often in Americanhistory and I think we're on the verge ofanother one here.

What people saw in Minneapolis with thedeath, the killing of George Floyd, coupled withother videos that people have seen, coupled withjust, I think, a general unease about things racialin the United States, I think we've seen peopleget into the streets, express concerns not onlyabout what we see in our criminal justice system,but more generally about the condition of people ofcolor in the United States.

I think we are as I said, at the beginning ofsomething that I think ultimately is going tolead to some positive change.

I'm actually cautiously optimistic about wherethis movement is going to take us.

LISA JACKSON: Wow.

That's great to hear because there's definitelya lot of energy out in the streets and there's alsoenergy in places across the country, inboardrooms, in companies, in schools.

In 2009, you famously called this country anation of cowards for our failure to talk openlyabout racial issues.And you took some heat for that comment.

Now look at us.So, how many people have called to apologize?ERIC HOLDER: I'm still waiting by the phone toget those apologies or you know, some indication thatmaybe I called something right back in 2009.The point of that speech was, and it's still true,I think, today, here in the United States, we areexperts at avoiding conversations about raceand in a lot of ways, that's understandable.

These are painful, awkward conversations but they'renecessary conversations.

If we want to get to a better place when it comesto racial things, we've got to discuss ourhistory, we have to be cognizant of what thepresent is all about, and we have to talk aboutwhere we want to go in the future.

Now, this means that we have to ask toughquestions of one another.

We have to face some hard historical truths.But if we don't engage in these conversations, we'renot going to make the kind of progress that we want.

So, that was the point of that speech.I think the speech has actually held up prettywell and what I said back then, you know, aboutAmericans being reluctant, hesitant to talk aboutracial things, I think is unfortunately still true,but I think those people in the streets, thosepeople in the streets are going to force this nationinto a very needed - a very needed conversation.

LISA JACKSON: Something we can no longer avoid andthat we shouldn't avoid.

ERIC HOLDER: I think that's just, you know,that's the beginning.We have to have the conversation but then wehave to use that conversation and thatnecessary interaction to come up with concretesteps to take us to that better place, changepolicies, put in place measures that willalleviate the unfairness, the injustice that stillexists in this country.

LISA JACKSON: So, that's - that's interesting.Let's talk about policy because I know you're anexpert on the police system.

You were our nation's top law enforcement officialand so much of your career centered on lawenforcement at all levels.

How do you contextualize the fight for justice withthe glaring injustices we're seeing carriedout by police?And what do you see from a policy perspective aboutmoving forward?ERIC HOLDER: Well, firstly, I think peopleneed to understand that you know, people findracism in the criminal justice system.

Well, that shouldn't be shocking.We are still a nation that is dealing with racismthroughout our society.

And so, if you look at any component of that society,you would expect to find racism.

Now, that's particularly troublesome when it comesto the criminal justice system where property,where life can be taken by the state.

And so, you want to make sure that we have asneutral a system as we possibly can.

I mean, there are concrete steps that can be taken.

We need to, you know, ban chokeholds.

We need to have better training.We need to be better in our selection of whoserves as police officers.We can investigate police departments.All of those things are important, extremelyimportant, but we've really got to deal withthose larger societal issues if we want to moveour criminal justice system to a better place.

And that gets back, again, to facing our history anddealing with these larger issues, the fact that wedon't have an educational system that works foreverybody in this country, that fair employment isnot necessarily something that everybody enjoyshere, that housing in the United States of Americais not necessarily made available to everybody onan equal basis.

You have to deal with these core issues inaddition to dealing with those things that aremanifest in the criminal justice system if we wantto get to that better place.LISA JACKSON: To these systemic issues, the onesthat are sort of embedded in how we run and how welive our daily lives.

ERIC HOLDER: Exactly.

I mean, it's - you can't divorce the criminaljustice system from the society that it is apart of.And you know, this sounds like a daunting task, youknow, talking about systemic changes of thingsthat have been in place for hundreds of years, butat the end of the day, we're talking aboutmanmade problems that are susceptible to manmade andwomanmade solutions.

And that's what makes me relatively, you know,relatively confident here.

We've got this new awakening.

We've got people in the streets.We have a new level of civic engagement, a newlevel of interest, a new willingness, I think, toconfront those hard issues.

If we can maintain this, this moment that we havecan be turned into a movement.So, that's what I think can be done.I think it's going to probably be led by youngpeople as social change in the past has tended tobe as well.

So, as I said, I'm cautiously - cautiously optimistic.

LISA JACKSON: Now, you know, Apple just announcedour new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.

So, at the heart of it is Apple using our platforms,our voice, our resources to challenge systemic racism.

I know a lot of times, inequalities are hiddenin the system.

They're not always directly able to be seen.Can you share some examples of how this hasshown up maybe in your own life or in your career,the inequities you've seen?ERIC HOLDER: Well, as an African American man inthe United States of America, you know, we allhave stories, you know, that we can tell.I remember going to run to a movie in Georgetownwhich is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., very richneighborhood, a predominantly white neighborhood.

It was evening, dark, so I was running to a moviealong with my cousin.Stopped by the police because they saw two Blackmen running in a white neighborhood and assumedthat something must have gone wrong here.

It must be something inappropriate.

Stopped us, put the spotlight on us, asked uswhat were we doing.I said well, you know, going to see a movie.What they didn't understand, the policeofficer didn't understand is that they had stoppedmy cousin, a Vietnam veteran and me.At the time, I was a federal prosecutor.I was an employee of the United States Departmentof Justice who worked with police officers and FBI agents.

But they didn't see that.

They just saw two Black guys and so you know, a story.And you know, my story is not different than othersthat - other Black men - that other Black men can share.So, that's, you know, a very visible, personal thing.But then there are systemic things that tendto be a little more hidden.

When you look at the ways in which people arerefused mortgages - red lining is what we call itin the United States.You know, areas are forbidden.

Certain areas are forbidden for people ofcolor to locate in.So, you go to a bank, you fill out an application,and your application is rejected.You don't really know why but it's aresult of discrimination.We've brought lawsuits against banks when I wasthe Attorney General to stop, you know, to stop that practice.

If you look at the Fortune 500, if you look at lawfirms, people of color are simply not represented tothe degree that you would expect as leadersof those organizations.And these are people who are, you know, there aresignificant numbers of people of color who arequalified, who should have opportunities to lead, butthey simply don't get those opportunities and asa result, we have again, these silent barriers,these silent glass ceilings that keep peopleaway from positions of leadership that theyotherwise should have.

LISA JACKSON: Yeah.

When I'm explaining it to people, I sometimes remindthem of something I'm sure you heard from yourparents, which is my mother and father used tosay, you have to be three times as good to get youknow, a third as much.

So, I think, you know, this idea of striving.

We're not afraid of doing the work but if the systemis stacked against you, it leads to frustration.

It leads to anger.

ERIC HOLDER: Yeah.

You know, it's interesting because I've heard certainpeople say it's an exhausting thing to be anAfrican American and have to deal with thesestereotypes, to deal with the prejudice, to dealwith the discrimination.And I thought to myself, you know what?It really isn't exhausting because we train for thisfrom the day that we leave the womb.

It's something that on a day to day basis,we get used to.

It's something that we - it's almost like trainingfor a marathon. You know?Day after day after day, you have to put up with this.

You have to figure out ways in which youdeal with it.

And after a while, it becomes almost unconscious.

It's just kind of the way you think that you have tolead your life.But you know, if you're a person of color and youcan imagine a world where you wouldn't have to dealwith all of those things, boy, it would be a muchbetter existence.

And I think that hidden - that hidden thing that wehave to deal with really does have a perniciouseffect both on our psyche and I think researchshows, on our bodies as well.

High levels of tension that leads to all kinds ofhealth problems.

But again, it's not something that you'reconscious of on a day to day basis because you dealwith it all the time and you just accept it,unfortunately, for the way life has to be.And that - that has to change.

LISA JACKSON: You know, I'm going to change thesubject a little bit.

I'm going to let that sit there for a second butthen I'm going to change the subject just a bit.

I was thinking back on the drive this morning, toinauguration day in 2009.

You and I, we were next to each other with ourspouses that morning.

The weight of history, the pageant of it all.We were both the first Black heads of ourrespective cabinet agencies.I am immensely proud of that.

I always say I was the first Black EPAAdministrator for the first Black president.But it says something about our country and ourprogress or lack thereof.

Is it something you think about and you know, howdoes that hit you?ERIC HOLDER: Yeah.I mean, it's certainly something thatI thought about then.

It's certainly something I reflect on now.

It's clear.I wasn't the first Black lawyer who was qualifiedto be Attorney General of the United States.I mean, I'm very grateful for the fact that I wasgiven that opportunity.I hope I did a good job.You know, there's kind of a dual pressure that youfeel being the first.

You don't want to disappoint people who havesacrificed and supported you and made it possiblefor you to become the first head of the EPA, thefirst head of the Justice Department.People sacrificed.People died.

People committed themselves so that other -next generations would have opportunities towhich they were denied.

And so, there's that pressure.Then there's also that pressure that you want tomake sure that you perform for the larger world andso that the stereotypes of lack of ability, of lackof performance, you dispel those and you feel thatpressure as well.

You know, it's - it's a lot of this stuff is aboutpressure, as I talked about before.

But again, you know, given those opportunities, Ithink I felt and I'm sure you felt a real duty toperform as best we could, to move the needle, toopen the doors for people who would come - who wouldcome after us.You know, it was great to serve with you, to servewith President Obama.I remember that day in 2009 and the hope that Ifelt and I think the hope that the nation felt.

I think actually, the hope that the world felt.

And I think, you know, we had a good eight-year run.There have been some reversals since thatperiod of time but I think as I said, the UnitedStates, and I think the world, is really on theverge of a new era, a new and better era.

LISA JACKSON: One thing we worked on together wasenvironmental racism or to fight environmentalracism, to bring about environmental justice.

And you know, if we're talking, environment isgoing to come up.

We know that communities of color aredisproportionately impacted by a range ofenvironmental ills, whether it's climatechange, air quality, water quality, drinking waterquality, land use decisions about what landwe are even able to - to consider developing interms of housing or schools.Is there space for an issue like that in theconversations that we're having in this moment?ERIC HOLDER: Oh, there's not onlyspace for that.

That is a necessary part of the conversation.We're really talking about life and death issues there.

I mean, we can put in place all kinds of newstructures, change attitudes, makeopportunities available, but you need to havepeople live and live in a way that enables them touse the God-given talents that they have.

I mean, we have seen, you know, the negative impactsof environmental racism shortening lives,negatively impacting lives, curtailing peoples'ability to reach all that they are capable of doing.

Environmental racism is something that I think fortoo long has not been front and centerand needs to be.I mean, it has to be because you're talkingabout you know, the way in which a society treats,you know, its people.

And locating things next to communities of colorthat are going to cause high rates of cancer, highrates of asthma, you know, the kinds of things thatcurtail, again, peoples' abilities.

These are the kinds of things that people ingovernment have to stop, that societies have to saythis is unacceptable, and we have to be, I think,more conscious of our environment and the impactthat environment has on all of our people.LISA JACKSON: So agree.

I even like to point out to younger people, eventhe roads we're driving on oftentimes cut a swathright through the heart of Black prosperity and theBlack community.

I grew up in New Orleans where Claiborne Avenuebecame an underpass, right?And it has a huge impact.

So, New Orleans.I'm also going to talk about music.It is Black Music Month.I know music is in your blood as well.

We just celebrated Friday, Juneteenth.

We talked about Black music as the soundtrackfor protest and you're no stranger to protests.You were even on the ground with activists inFerguson, Missouri.What has been the soundtrack of yourstruggles through the years?And follow-up question; what's the music that'sgiving you life right now?ERIC HOLDER: Well, when I think about protests andmusic that I like, there is one album.

What's Going On, Marvin Gaye, 1971-1972.

It was a great album then.

I think it's the greatest album that's ever been made.

With, you know, all due respect to the Beatles andother artists.

It was great back in the early 70's and it stillresonates in the 21st Century.

You know, What's Going On.

You listen to Marvin sing in that song, over thecourse of that whole album, you know, both sides.

It's - he talks about the problems that heconfronted, his brother confronted in Vietnam, butit speaks also to issues that we have herein the 21st Century.

You know, and so, I still listen to that.I still love that.

But now, you know, it's interesting.You know, what am I listening to now?I mean, 21st Century, this is a turbulent time and Ilook for peace in my music and so I've gone back.

I'm kind of hanging out in the 70's.

So, Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, Aretha Franklin,Earth, Wind, and Fire, the Stylistics.

All - this is the music of my youth.

A turbulent time but a time that we got through,a time that gives me hope, makes me think that youknow, as turbulent as the late 60's and early 70'swere, we got through it and we made a better America.

We have turbulent times now in the early part ofthe 21st Century and again, I'm cautiously optimistic.I think we'll get through it again and music helpsme have that optimism.LISA JACKSON: Yeah. Me too.

I'm going to bump Living Just Enough for the Cityup on that playlist too.

I always - Innervisions.

I think that's the reason I actually became anenvironmentalist, listening to the story ofthis brother getting off the bus in New York andwhat happened to him, you know, in those decades after.ERIC HOLDER: If you look at What's Going On,you've got to remember Mercy, Mercy Me, the Ecology.I mean, Marvin covered everything, you know?He covered protests, demonstrations, Vietnam,the Ecology.

It's a - it's a masterpiece.

LISA JACKSON: It is. It is.Alright, let me take it to the tech community.

This is a wonderful audience listening to us,dynamic, talented developers who - who areinterested in this fight, interested in the fightfor change, and I've heard from so many people acrossApple, throughout our network, who are lookingfor ways to help.

What are some ways that tech and developers, appdevelopers specifically, can help tackle racism inthe work that they do every day?ERIC HOLDER: Well, tell you, you know, thisis an unbelievably creative community and Ithink using the skills that you have to - toaggregate, to massage, to work with data and then toshare information, I think that's - I mean, that'sthe core of what it is that developers do, Ithink, at their best, you know, simplifying things,making things accessible to people around the world.

So, I would say that you know, I am not as creativenor technically proficient as people are in thisaudience, but using those - those skills, thosereally special skills to come up with ways in whichyou make available to people the possibilitiesthat they have, opportunities with regardto how they can make their lives better,opportunities in which they can you know, monitorthings that are being done in their societies, waysin which the information can be shared across borders.

This is all the kinds of stuff that you all do soextremely well.

I would ask you to think, you know, about maybeturning your focus from the things that are moretraditionally have been expected of you and thinkabout new ways that you can look at this, thisother frontier, this racial frontier that isnot only in the United States but in othercountries as well, and think about ways in whichyou can focus that creativity, those skillson this problem of race and ethnic strife.

What are the things that you can do there that canalleviate those problems?I'm really confident.

Again, if this community focuses on those issues,coupled with great companies like Apple, youall could have a really meaningful impact for thegood on the issues that we have been discussing.

LISA JACKSON: Alright.We will take that.

Eric, it is always such an honor to talk to you, suchtime well spent, so much to take away fromour time together.

I just want to thank you so much for joining us,for all you do, for all you've been in service toequality to our community.Just huge thank you.And thanks to all of you for tuning in.

Enjoy the rest of Dub-Dub.
