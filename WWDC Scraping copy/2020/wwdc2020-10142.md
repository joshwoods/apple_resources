Search this video…Hello, and welcome to WWDC.Hi, I’m Eric and along with my colleague Pınar,we manage the Retail Store Apps Mobile Engineering team,and we're here to discuss building enterprise applicationsthat are robust, flexible and maintainable.At Apple, we have over 500 storeswhere we work to constantly redefine the retail experience.Our amazing retail employees are the heart of our retail operationsand we build the apps that support them...from our system that manages store reservationsto our product catalog and managing store layout.They all work together to build a fluid systemthat makes our stores run smoothly.Now you know a bit about why we do what we do.The rest of this session covers how we do it,and how you can take advantage of the same practicesin your own enterprise apps.Our agenda includes architecting for sharing across apps,which covers some of the basic principles you should considerwhen either building new apps or rearchitecting existing apps.We'll also cover testing your apps after they've been built.And finally, Pınar will discuss some aspects of managing your apponce it's been pushed to production.When building your apps,there are many features of iOS that make multiple apps work together nicely.I’ll go over a few of them.Enabling app groups, benefits of Swift packagesand finding good package candidates.App groups are one of the first iOS features that we took advantage ofwhen developing our suite of apps.Once enabled, it gave us the ability to share multiple types of datavia UserDefaults and shared files.All of the setup can be done via the Signing and Capabilities sectionin your project file within Xcode.Let’s see how it works.First, click on the + Capability button and then select App Groups.This will add a new App Group panel.Selecting the plus button in that panel will add a new App Groupand add it to your developer portal as well,so other apps in the same portal have access to it.Once you have your app group set up in Xcode, sharing data is easy.This example shows how to share data using UserDefaults.First, we’ve created an instance of UserDefaults,passing it to our app group to initialize it.After this initial setup, setting values is as easy as calling the set method.Reading values is also just as easy using one of the named type methods,such as string, integer, Boolean, et cetera.Next, let’s talk about Swift packages.There are many reasons we used Swift packageswhen looking at our existing apps, as well as when we build new ones.The most obvious is that it reduces code duplication.This decreases our development time and the risk of human error,thus increasing the reliability of our apps.It also provides more flexibility in our organization,allowing people to move from team to team easier with less onboarding overheadsince much of the codebase will already be known.We’ve also built a team that solely works on developing these packages,allowing them to focus more in-depth on the problems the packages are solving.After building our iOS apps,our team identified many areas that were great candidates.Just like many of you,Apple uses standard authentication methods across our applications.Because of this, authentication was a perfect choice.We’ve built ours on top of URLSession,and in doing so, it removes the burden of thinking about auth from the engineer,allowing them to interact with the server as if the authentication doesn’t exist.Another network-related package is for image caching and fetching.This allows us to queue images and cache them to disk as necessary,again, freeing our engineers from worrying aboutthe network connection or where the image is coming from.Everything we build is based on UIKit.We use custom table view cells and product detail views,which we package to ensure consistencywhere the same UI is used across multiple apps.Many of our applications have similar objects,such as customers, reservations and products.These model objects are prime candidates for extracting into a Swift packageand sharing across each of our apps,allowing for standardized definitions of our model.The final package I want to talk to you today about is our scanning package.We built it on top of Vision and AVFoundation.This gives a common look and feel for our bar code, QR and text recognitionacross each of our apps.Let me show you what that looks like.Using the Vision framework, our package is capable of scanning many symbologies,such as PDF417, DataMatrix and QR codes.In addition, it also allows us to do real-time OCR to capture text-based data.On top of the Vision framework,we've built a layer that can show a supplementary UI viewto help the user target the camera, customize accessibility support,control the flash,and simplify configuration into a clean, common API.Let’s look at what a couple of those look like.Our code uses the same patterns whether you’re scanning a barcode or text.The setup is simple.Initialize the appropriate view controller,passing in a struct containing configuration optionsand assign a delegate.It’s that simple for the engineer.The delegate handles the messaging for successes and failuresof the scanning process.I’ll show you a bit more how that works.Here, we create an instance of scan options,which is a struct that holds the configuration in our scanning package.We then initialize a new barcodeScannerViewControllerwith that same configuration.This configuration/initializer patternallows us to easily save and reuse them across each of our apps.Our next example is very similar to the first.Rather than scanning a barcode,this controller allows us to scan and recognize text within the view area.We’ve kept the same configuration/initializer patternas the barcode example,making it quick and easy to use either package.With both of these, our API provides a default UIthat can be replaced or fully customized to the needs of each application.This makes it easy to keep the UI in all of our apps consistent.We talked about app groups and Swift packages.Now let’s talk about testing.After our apps were built, we, of course, needed to test themto make sure that they did what we expected them to.We could have an army of people do this,but there are more efficient ways to go about it.Let's go over a few of the most common cases.Three of those are unit testing, UI testing and performance testing.Unit testing is the first step in our testing strategyand begins with the engineering team.As they write the classes and functions that power the apps,it's important to create unit teststo make sure that they return the values that are expected for each code path.Xcode provides fantastic support for unit tests with the XCTest framework,which enables you to quickly write and run your tests.For more in-depth information, there are many sessions available.I would recommend starting with "Testing in Xcode"and "Testing Tips and Tricks."We use UI testing as much as possible,as this is where you see real efficiency gains.UI testing takes the manual test cases your QE team has createdand encodes them in Swift.Xcode comes with XCUITest that provides a structure for building and running them.Once we created these tests, we broke them down by importance.Tests can take time to run, so breaking them down by priorityallows us to run the most important tests more frequently than others.The more frequent they're run, the quicker we can catch any failures.We do this on a check-in, daily and weekly basis.The WWDC session "UI Testing in Xcode 7" is a great place to start for more info.When we look at performance testing on iOS devices,what we’re really looking at is two things:rendering performance and battery performance.The CPU and GPU in modern iOS devices are very powerful,but we still need to focus on the performanceof every interaction in our app.There’s nothing more frustrating for a userthan a view that doesn’t scroll smoothlyor a drag operation that takes a split second too long.Battery performance is also very important for us.Our devices are on the store floor all day long.When an employee has to step out of the front of houseto take their device to a charging station,that’s lost productivity,not to mention the extra devices that we have to have on hand.Engineers have an excellent tool at their disposalthat makes accomplishing these tasks easy and straightforward: Instruments.Instruments is a tool also built in to Xcodethat has helped us analyze areas of our appsthat are taking a long time to execute,have higher than expected memory or battery usage and much more.For more information on Instruments,please check out the sessions "Practical Approaches to Great App Performance"and "Improving Battery Life and Performance."Now, I’ll hand this off to Pınarto dive into managing apps once they’re deployed to production.Thank you, Eric.With all the wonderful info Eric just shared with you all,you might be wondering how we manage our apps in production with configurations.First, I will discuss why we develop with app configurations in mind.Then I will discuss points on backwards compatibilityand requiring users to force update.There are two configurationsour applications currently support simultaneously:Client based configuration file and a Server based one,which is essentially Boolean values downloaded from our server.Let’s talk about client based configuration first.Having a configuration filethat is baked in our client but hosted on the server,allows us to have more flexibility and adaptabilityaround the user experience in our application.These elements can then be manipulated at the geo, market,and, in our case, at the Apple retail store level.Changing these attributes in production does not depend on any code changes.Therefore, no new client builds would be necessary.This makes the application highly adaptableto our ever-changing business needs.Our applications also have server configurations in placewhich can also drive the app behavior.We rely on data from our server to show certain elements.This provides a great flexibility where some features may not be usedfor certain geos, markets and, in our case, certain Apple retail stores.Our server can simply turn on or off features based on the global market level.Just like having a robust client config,changing values on the server does not require any code change.Once config values are deployed on the server,changes will automatically be reflected in our application’s behavior.Server configurations can also be exposed to business and operations teams,where they can take sole control of the values being set.They can then turn on or off features according to the business needs.This partnership frees up developers' time to maintain these configsand allows them to focus on the engineering instead.Here’s a high-level illustrationof how these configurations might work for your application.With client configuration, you can create a PLIST filewith all the attributes you want to include.Your server can then host this file in a JSON format.During your startup sequence,your application can download all the attributes that are set.If, for any reason, during productionyou want to change a value for an attribute,you can just change it in the PLIST fileand upload a new version of the config to the server.When your application launches again, the new changes will take place.I will show you how that can be done in just few minutes with an example.With server based configurations,your business or operations teams can take full control of setting the values.This way they can turn on or off features at a global leveland change values to adapt to business and market needs.Your iOS application can then fetch a service APIwhere these attributes are set,and these flags will ultimately drive your application’s behavior.Let’s dive in to a client-based configuration as an example.Here we have all the fields we want to define for a customer form.We have First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number,and maybe other info that we'd like to collect from our customers.These attributes are carefully mapped in our client codeand remain as generic as possible in our function definitions.That way, we can manipulate them in our PLIST files.Here's what the form looks like in our application’s UI in production.Now, let’s say our stakeholders do not need to collectcustomers’ email addresses any longerand want to remove that field from the UI right away.We can simply delete the Email field in our configuration PLIST fileand upload a new version of the config to our server.When the application is launched again, the email field is no longer seen.No code changes, no new client builds,it just works.Now let’s say our stakeholders do not need to collectcustomers’ phone numbers either and needs this change done right now.We can repeat the same processand upload the new version of the config to our server.And again, when we pull the new config, Phone Number field is no longer shown.As you can see, having a config-driven user experienceallows us to manage our application in productionwith greater flexibility and adaptability.With server and client hand in hand and work in such close orchestration,backwards compatibility is something we always have to keep in mindas new changes in the servermay not be supported in our old client and vice versa.In our experience, having config versioning in placehas helped us a great deal in navigating these waters.Our application checks which version of the server and client configurationthat is being downloaded at startup.We can then determine which user experience to show, or not show,to our users.There are, of course, caseswhere we do need our users to force update to the version of the app,otherwise they will not be able to see the new features we developed.When a new value for an attribute is added in the clientbut server does not have mapping for it,neither server nor client can support each other.In such cases, requiring users to force update is necessary.And to wrap up, we covered app groups, shared frameworks and testing,we went over utilizing config-driven user experience,and, finally, discussed points in why backwards compatibilityand requiring users to force updates are necessary.Thank you for watching.We look forward to seeing the apps you develop with iOS 14.Hope you have an enjoyable WWDC this year.Stay safe and healthy out there.
