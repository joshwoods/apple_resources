manageacross our platform, apps, and services that you use.Whether you're assigning 6th graders activitiesusing Schoolwork on an iPad,setting up iPhones in your organization for the first time,or using Apple Business Manager to purchase apps and booksfor your organization,it is Apple's hardware, software, and servicesthat are at the center of your deployment.And this year we've made some significant strides inbringing numerous crucial device management features to the Mac.Today we're going to start by reviewing how you candeploy, manage, and secure MacOS Big Sur.Setting up and deploying Macs has never been easier.With Essential Services from Apple,your organization can quickly deployand support Macs at scale.Our vision of enrollment requires nothing morethan unboxing a Mac and booting it up.And we're delivering on that promisewith automated device enrollment.All the user needs to do is select their languageand connect to Wi- Fi.It automatically enrollsorganization-owned devices into MDM,so you don't have to touch them before you hand them out.Enrollment customization allows you to add branding,consent text, and use modern authenticationduring the setup process.It provides a better experience while using new auth vendorssuch as Microsoft Azure Active Directory,Okta, Ping, and more.Using the credentials from your identity providerin enrollment customization,you can pre-populate the user's full name and short name.We're also introducing the ability to chooseif the account can enable user channel management too.After creating a user account,you can customize the setup processto meet your organization's needs.Choose which steps to hide and show such as Siri,TouchID, FileVault, Analytics, Location, and more.With automated device enrollment there's no step three;you land at the desktop.Automated device enrollmentenables you to automate MDM enrollmentand simplify device setup.You can supervise devices during activationwithout touching them, as well as lock MDM enrollmentfor ongoing management.A few years ago, we introduced a new featurethat makes it easy to setup Apple TVs at scale.It's been very successful and we're bringing it to the Mac.All that you do is plug in power and connect Ethernetand then boot up.And all of the setup screens are automatically skipped.You land right at login.It's the fastest way to set up a Macand we think you're going to love it.Auto-advance for automated device enrollmentmakes it easy to set up a Mac.It requires you to manage your devicesusing Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager.Only power and Ethernet are requiredbut your network must support DHCP.Skip all the setup assistant stepsand reach login within secondsor customize the setup to meet your needs.And if you use encrypted disks,you will be required to enter your password.Now I've got one more deployment feature for the Macthat I really want to tell you about.And yes, it's for the new Mac Pro!It's called Lights Out Managementand will enable admins to deploy Mac Pros at scale.You can start up, shut down, and rebootone or more Macs remotely, even if they are unresponsive.This is accomplished by sending a command from your MDM serverto the MDM-enrolled controller on your Mac network.Lights Out Management requires macOS Big Surand your Mac Pros must be on the same subnet.And you're going to want to installthe Lights Out Management payload too.Here's how it works.You'll need to enroll a Macto act as the controller on your local networkand you will need all the Mac Pros to enroll as well.Then connect all the Mac Pros to the enrolled LOM controller Mac.Send the command to your MDM server.Your MDM vendor will need to support the new Mac commandsin order for this to work.The LOM controller Mac receives the commandand distributes them to each of the Mac Pros.Lights Out Management for the new Mac Prois an awesome new featureand we hope that you'll take advantage of it.These terrific new enhancements to deployment will help youset up Macs at scale faster than ever before.But once you have your Macs deployed,what about ongoing management?Let's start with supervision.Supervision gives admins greater control of how devices operate.We're making a change here that you've  been waiting for.Previously, user-approved MDM didn't havethe same capabilities as automated device enrolled Macs.Not anymore!Any Mac enrolled in a user-approved MDMwill now be considered supervised.Admins have the same special abilities,such as controlling activation lockand leveraging bootstrap tokens,just as they do if the device was enrolledusing automated device enrollment.You can query and list local users and choose to delete them,as well as replace or remove profilesand install supervised restrictions using MDM commandsand schedule software updates.We've learned a lotfrom managed software updates on iOS and iPadOSand we want to bring that same experience to the Mac.There's a number of new MDM commands for software update,including forcing client Macs to accept software updatesand then restart,major releases of macOS and non-OS updatescan now be deferred up to 90 days,and we've made a few changes to increase security,such as the removal of the software update catalog,as well as the Ignore flag for major updates only.Now that's the story for managed software updates,but what about apps?Managed Apps have been a terrific feature on iOSfor many years, and we want to bring it to the Mac, too.You can now remove apps using MDM commandsor they can be removed upon device unenrollment.Managed app configuration and feedback are supportedjust as they are on iOS and iPadOS.And if eligible, you can convert unmanaged appsto managed using MDM.User-enrolled devices that have managed apps installeddo not support conversion.Apps have always been the cornerstoneof the macOS experience but as cool as they are,large apps can include additional componentsthat need to be downloaded to each of your clients.Doing that can slow things down and use up valuable time,which is why we hope you're using Content Cachingto reduce internet usage while speeding upthe rate of downloading of apps, books, iCloud content,GarageBand music, software updates,Xcode components, and so much more.There are over two dozen data typessupported by content caching.We've added support for internet recovery.The initial boot image isn't included,but the full 6 gigabyte recovery image is cached,which will restore Macs on your network faster than ever.When we integrated content caching into macOSa few years ago,we included a new tab and activity monitorthat displays key performance metricsto help you understand how your content is being used.We're now making those metrics available to youusing the new Content Caching Information MDM command.They help you determine if content caching is turned on,working, and helping your clients download content faster.It gives you the information about registration state,cache pressure, bytes served, and so much more.As a developer, please resist the urge to set this commandrepeatedly at high frequency,as it really wasn't intended to be usedlike it is an activity monitor.There's a bunch of great new features for content cachingand we hope that you'll take advantage of them to speed updownloading of content to the devices on your network.Now just as we have with deployment and management,we're also bringing a number of security improvements from iOSto the Mac.At Apple, we strive to strike the right balancebetween improving securityand preserving effortless deployment workflows.Today we are introducing more things you can dowith bootstrap tokens.A bootstrap token is a reserved encryption keyprovided by your MDM server that enables macOSto create admin accountswithout needing to authenticate with an admin password.Historically, admins would need to create complicated workflowsto create accounts on the systemand then add individual user accounts.Not anymore!Bootstrap tokens enable users to get a secure tokenand boot a Mac that uses FileVault.This is a really useful feature if you used network accounts.Bootstrap tokens improve the login workflowfor mobile accounts.Once implemented, admins can take advantageof authorized software updates and kernel extensions.Bootstrap tokens are supported on the latest Macswith Apple T2 Security Chip.Please review developer documentation to learn moreabout bootstrap tokens in your deployment.Now let's talk about how we took measures to protect users.You might be asked to installa profile that was sent to you in an emailor one that was downloaded in a web page.Since profiles can configure your device,we need to make sure that we don't install them accidentallyfrom people that you don't trust.In iOS and iPadOS,we introduced downloaded profiles.This is where we isolate a profile that's been downloaded.We have you install it manually by paying a visit to Settings.It's designed to help protect customers.We're bringing downloaded profiles to the Macto offer the same security benefits.When you download a profile, you'll receive a notificationthat you can review it in Settings.Visit System Profiles paneand you'll see a new group labeled Downloaded Profiles.Here you can preview the profile and click Install.Confirm that you actually want to install itand enter your password to complete the installation.Profiles can modify the way your device is configuredand we want users to take an informed decisionwhen installing them.As an MDM developer,you're going to want to consider the challengesthat Downloaded Profiles poses to your deployment workflows.Once a profile is downloaded,it remains in System Preferences for eight minutesbefore it is removed from the System Preferences pane.As we informed you previously,we've continued to make security enhancementsthat impact several command line toolsthat you may be using in your deployment workflows.As of macOS Big Sur, you will no longer be ableto completely install profiles using Terminal.When you attempt to install a profile via the command line,it will treat it as if it was downloadedand you'll have to complete the installin the Profile System Preferences pane manually.All other features of the Profiles command line toolwill remain the same and continue to work as expected.In addition to changes to the Profiles command line tool,macOS Big Sur also includes a toolcalled networksetup that makes it easy to viewand edit your network settings using Terminal.The problem is that admins and standard usershave the same abilities to view and modifynetwork settings from the command line.We've now imbued these accounts types with different abilitieswhen using the networksetup tool.We've also hardened security by honoring the settingthat requires your admin passwordwhen modifying system-wide preferences.Here's some detail around networksetup tool.Admins and standard users now have different capabilities.Standard users can only read network settings,turn on and off Wi-Fi, and change the access point.They no longer have the same unbridled capabilitiesthat admins do.Tick the checkbox to require your passwordwhen modifying settings and security and privacybut admins can get around this by using sudo.There's one more significant security enhancementthat you should be aware of.Automated Device Enrollment uses device serial numbersto know which devices to enroll at activation.Serial numbers contain bits of identifiable informationlike where and when the device was built.These 12-character numbers help Appletarget devices made at the same time,in the same place, to maintain quality.To address identifiable informationbeing used maliciously, we're going to start issuingcompletely random 10-character serial numbersacross our product line.As an MDM vendor, you depend on automated device enrollmentand serial numbers to identify devices.You'll need to take the new serial number format changeinto account within your products.Third-party solutions must be capable of handlingboth the current product serial number formatsand the newly-updated format at the same time.There are a number of other new device management features,restrictions, and commands that MDM vendorscan now take advantage of in macOS Big Sur.Please consult our updated configuration profileand MDM protocol reference documentationat developer.apple.com to learn more.It's a big year for the Mac,but the latest release of iOS and iPadOShave tons of great device management featuresincluded this year too.From Shared iPad for Business and Temporary Sessionto Shortcuts now supporting Managed Open In,iOS and iPadOS have a ton to offer administrators.Just like with Mac, we're going to focus onhow admins can deploy, manage, and secure iOS and iPadOS too.Let's start with deployment.When time is of the essence, Apple Configurator helps youmass configure iPhones, iPads, and Apple TVs fastusing a USB cable.Apple Configurator now supports apps and books locationsthat are provided by Apple School Managerand Apple Business Manager.Locations are different places where devices are kept.For example, an institution may usea completely different set of apps and booksat an elementary school than they do at a high school.With this new feature,admins can now go to the account menuand select the location they'd like to use.That displays an entirely different set of apps and booksfor each location that has been configuredin Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager.This is a critical feature for our customersand we're excited to introduce it.In addition to locations, cfgutil is now more scalableand can restore larger numbers of devices than ever before.And if you didn't notice, Apple Configuratorsports a brand new look in macOS Big Sur.Now let's turn to a few more additions in iOS deployment.Automated device enrollment enables youto customize the setup assistant to simplify MDM enrollmentand device setup.It enables you to get to the Home screenwithout needing to use the setup assistant.And we're adding new skip keys for the newGetting Started and Update Completed panes in iOS 14.We've now brought the Setup Assistant payload to iOS,although it works a little differently than on macOS.Using the payload, you specify the same skip keysyou use with automated device enrollmentand then they will take effect during future upgrades.The payload offers two benefits.First, it allows you to skip Setup Assistant panesduring an upgrade that you didn't know aboutwhen initially setting up the device.And second, skipping the setup panes during upgradeis now possible on all supervised devices,not just those enrolled using Apple School Managerand Apple Business Manager.I would now like to discuss one of my favoritedevice management features: Shared iPad.It allows students to have a personal experienceon a shared device.Shared iPad gives schools the ability to provideeach and every student with a personalized experienceand their own data, even if the students are sharing iPads.Earlier this year, we added some great new featuresto expand the ways in which Shared iPadcan be used in different types of organizations,not only schools.Shared iPad for Business can be configuredusing Apple Business Manager just as you do to configure itfor students in Apple School Manager.Employees can sign into Shared iPadusing their managed Apple ID.This is a great feature for service businessessuch as restaurants where you can deployshared devices to take orders from customers.If you use Microsoft Azure Active Directory,your users can now sign in using federated authenticationand Shared iPad now supportsthe new single sign-on extension too.But wait, there's more!Shared iPad now supports dynamic numbers of cached userswhich allows you to set the amount of storage for each userinstead of a fixed number of users.You can also now delete all users from a shared iPad at onceand we have added queries for estimated resident usersand quota size.And a highly requested feature called temporary session.A temporary session further expands the way shared iPadcan be used in different organizationsby allowing a user to sign in temporarilywithout needing an account.When you sign out, all the datathe user created during the session will be deleted.It's a quick and easy way for people to startusing a shared iPad without a managed Apple ID.Those are all the new deployment featureswe've introduced in iOS and iPadOS 14.Now let's review what we're going to doto make managing iPhones and iPads even better.First up is non-removable managed apps,a great new feature that admins will be excited about.Previously, admins could completely lock the Home screenand prevent the deletion of all apps,which constrained the user's abilityto manage their own apps.Now users can continue to rearrange their appsand install new appsand delete other apps that they've installed.And admins can mark only mission-critical managed appsas non-removable.When your users try to delete or offload a managed app,it prevents it and displays an alert.Non-removable managed apps ensures that your usersalways have the apps they need on their devices.You can now mark specific managed apps as non-removable,which will prevent the user from removing or offloading.Just like organizations want to be able to havesome control over the apps on their employee's devices,they also want to keep a tight controlover their proprietary data.And this year,we've added several new ways to maintain that control.Let's start with a great new iOS productivity feature: Shortcuts.Shortcuts deliver a quick wayyou can get things done with your appsor with just a tap by asking Siri.By Shortcuts supporting Managed Open In,when a shortcut triggers an actionwhere data flow is not allowed because of the device policy,the shortcut will immediately stop running.We do this by controlling the flow of datato make sure that managed data does not get sharedwith unmanaged apps and services and vice versa.This makes certain that your organization's datadoes not fall into the wrong hands.Building on preventing sensitive data from being shared,let's turn to notifications.Organizations want to ensure that sensitive informationcannot be revealed without user intent,so we've added a setting to control Notification previewsto help.It's a new key in the notification settings payloadcalled Preview Type,which controls when previews are shown in notifications:never, always, or only after the userhas unlocked their device.The new key is only respected on supervised devicesand will help your organizationkeep your data private and secure.Now I have just one more management featureI would like to share with youbefore we move on to our security features.Managing remote devices around the worldis something that we are all becoming more familiar with.Let's say you have employeesthat are located across multiple countriesand some of them don't use location.It really doesn't make a lot of sensefor their devices to be configuredto use the time zone of your MDM server by default.Time management of end pointsis a critical function of key services.If set incorrectly, it could cause serious problemssuch as authentication issues.So we're introducing the new Set Timezone MDM commandthat allows you to choose the time zone for each device.And it's not dependent on Location Services whatsoever.Make sure you review developer documentationto learn more about how you cantake advantage of this new command.And those are just some of the new management featureswe are bringing to iOS and iPadOS 14 this year.But what can we do to continue to improvethe security of your devices?In this section, we will cover some changes coming this yearthat will impact deployment workflowsas well as some new management capabilitiesyou can use to secure iPhones and iPads in your organization.VPN, or virtual private networks,let people send and receive data across public networks.There are three types of VPN that iOS supports:Full Tunnel, which all traffic can flow through;Split Tunnel,which chooses which traffic can flow through it;and we've added support for per-app VPN,which only lets certain apps' data flow through it.Today, we're going to add support for youto choose which VPN your accounts should use.This is called Per Account VPN for iOSand it allows you to choose a replacement VPNfor Contacts, Calendars, and Mail domains.You can associate an individual account with VPNjust like you can the traffic of an app.Developers only need to replace the keys in the Domain payloadto take advantage of this new feature.Since we're on the topic of encrypted traffic,you can now encrypt your DNS too.Most of our traffic is encrypted when we talk to a server.But when we talk to a DNS server,those connections aren't secure.So in addition to per account VPN,we're also introducing Encrypted DNS settings.Encrypted DNS allows you to enhance securitywithout needing to configure VPN.iOS already supports the standard for secure DNS.Now we're providing the ability to manage it via MDM as well.Let's talk about just one morenew security feature we've included this year.Beginning in iOS 14,whenever a device associates with a Wi-Fi network,it will use a random MAC addressinstead of the device's true hardware MAC address.For enterprise networks that use captive portals or filtering,the new feature may cause an unexpected behavioras the device may not be identified when it joins.If the device fails to join the network,it will fall back to using its real MAC address.While users can disable this feature in Settings,we've also made it possible to disable itusing the Wi-Fi payload.As there were for macOS Big Sur,there are a number of other new device management features,restrictions, and commands that MDM vendorscan now take advantage of in iOS, iPad OS, and tvOS.Please consult our updated configuration profileand MDM protocol reference documentationat developer.apple.com to learn more.Thanks for joining me to learn what's newin managing Apple's devices at WWDC 2020.We hope you'll take advantage of the great new featuresacross our platforms this year.Thanks.

♪Hello and welcome to WWDC.

Kevin Milden: Hello, I'm Kevin Mildenand I'm on Apple's Device Management team.

At Apple, our team spends our timefocused on making devices easier to manageacross our platform, apps, and services that you use.

Whether you're assigning 6th graders activitiesusing Schoolwork on an iPad,setting up iPhones in your organization for the first time,or using Apple Business Manager to purchase apps and booksfor your organization,it is Apple's hardware, software, and servicesthat are at the center of your deployment.

And this year we've made some significant strides inbringing numerous crucial device management features to the Mac.

Today we're going to start by reviewing how you candeploy, manage, and secure MacOS Big Sur.

Setting up and deploying Macs has never been easier.

With Essential Services from Apple,your organization can quickly deployand support Macs at scale.

Our vision of enrollment requires nothing morethan unboxing a Mac and booting it up.

And we're delivering on that promisewith automated device enrollment.

All the user needs to do is select their languageand connect to Wi- Fi.

It automatically enrollsorganization-owned devices into MDM,so you don't have to touch them before you hand them out.

Enrollment customization allows you to add branding,consent text, and use modern authenticationduring the setup process.

It provides a better experience while using new auth vendorssuch as Microsoft Azure Active Directory,Okta, Ping, and more.

Using the credentials from your identity providerin enrollment customization,you can pre-populate the user's full name and short name.

We're also introducing the ability to chooseif the account can enable user channel management too.

After creating a user account,you can customize the setup processto meet your organization's needs.

Choose which steps to hide and show such as Siri,TouchID, FileVault, Analytics, Location, and more.

With automated device enrollment there's no step three;you land at the desktop.

Automated device enrollmentenables you to automate MDM enrollmentand simplify device setup.

You can supervise devices during activationwithout touching them, as well as lock MDM enrollmentfor ongoing management.

A few years ago, we introduced a new featurethat makes it easy to setup Apple TVs at scale.

It's been very successful and we're bringing it to the Mac.

All that you do is plug in power and connect Ethernetand then boot up.

And all of the setup screens are automatically skipped.

You land right at login.

It's the fastest way to set up a Macand we think you're going to love it.

Auto-advance for automated device enrollmentmakes it easy to set up a Mac.

It requires you to manage your devicesusing Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager.

Only power and Ethernet are requiredbut your network must support DHCP.

Skip all the setup assistant stepsand reach login within secondsor customize the setup to meet your needs.

And if you use encrypted disks,you will be required to enter your password.

Now I've got one more deployment feature for the Macthat I really want to tell you about.

And yes, it's for the new Mac Pro!It's called Lights Out Managementand will enable admins to deploy Mac Pros at scale.

You can start up, shut down, and rebootone or more Macs remotely, even if they are unresponsive.

This is accomplished by sending a command from your MDM serverto the MDM-enrolled controller on your Mac network.

Lights Out Management requires macOS Big Surand your Mac Pros must be on the same subnet.

And you're going to want to installthe Lights Out Management payload too.

Here's how it works.

You'll need to enroll a Macto act as the controller on your local networkand you will need all the Mac Pros to enroll as well.

Then connect all the Mac Pros to the enrolled LOM controller Mac.

Send the command to your MDM server.

Your MDM vendor will need to support the new Mac commandsin order for this to work.

The LOM controller Mac receives the commandand distributes them to each of the Mac Pros.

Lights Out Management for the new Mac Prois an awesome new featureand we hope that you'll take advantage of it.

These terrific new enhancements to deployment will help youset up Macs at scale faster than ever before.

But once you have your Macs deployed,what about ongoing management?Let's start with supervision.

Supervision gives admins greater control of how devices operate.

We're making a change here that you've  been waiting for.

Previously, user-approved MDM didn't havethe same capabilities as automated device enrolled Macs.

Not anymore!Any Mac enrolled in a user-approved MDMwill now be considered supervised.

Admins have the same special abilities,such as controlling activation lockand leveraging bootstrap tokens,just as they do if the device was enrolledusing automated device enrollment.

You can query and list local users and choose to delete them,as well as replace or remove profilesand install supervised restrictions using MDM commandsand schedule software updates.

We've learned a lotfrom managed software updates on iOS and iPadOSand we want to bring that same experience to the Mac.

There's a number of new MDM commands for software update,including forcing client Macs to accept software updatesand then restart,major releases of macOS and non-OS updatescan now be deferred up to 90 days,and we've made a few changes to increase security,such as the removal of the software update catalog,as well as the Ignore flag for major updates only.

Now that's the story for managed software updates,but what about apps?Managed Apps have been a terrific feature on iOSfor many years, and we want to bring it to the Mac, too.

You can now remove apps using MDM commandsor they can be removed upon device unenrollment.

Managed app configuration and feedback are supportedjust as they are on iOS and iPadOS.

And if eligible, you can convert unmanaged appsto managed using MDM.

User-enrolled devices that have managed apps installeddo not support conversion.

Apps have always been the cornerstoneof the macOS experience but as cool as they are,large apps can include additional componentsthat need to be downloaded to each of your clients.

Doing that can slow things down and use up valuable time,which is why we hope you're using Content Cachingto reduce internet usage while speeding upthe rate of downloading of apps, books, iCloud content,GarageBand music, software updates,Xcode components, and so much more.

There are over two dozen data typessupported by content caching.

We've added support for internet recovery.

The initial boot image isn't included,but the full 6 gigabyte recovery image is cached,which will restore Macs on your network faster than ever.

When we integrated content caching into macOSa few years ago,we included a new tab and activity monitorthat displays key performance metricsto help you understand how your content is being used.

We're now making those metrics available to youusing the new Content Caching Information MDM command.

They help you determine if content caching is turned on,working, and helping your clients download content faster.

It gives you the information about registration state,cache pressure, bytes served, and so much more.

As a developer, please resist the urge to set this commandrepeatedly at high frequency,as it really wasn't intended to be usedlike it is an activity monitor.

There's a bunch of great new features for content cachingand we hope that you'll take advantage of them to speed updownloading of content to the devices on your network.

Now just as we have with deployment and management,we're also bringing a number of security improvements from iOSto the Mac.

At Apple, we strive to strike the right balancebetween improving securityand preserving effortless deployment workflows.

Today we are introducing more things you can dowith bootstrap tokens.

A bootstrap token is a reserved encryption keyprovided by your MDM server that enables macOSto create admin accountswithout needing to authenticate with an admin password.

Historically, admins would need to create complicated workflowsto create accounts on the systemand then add individual user accounts.

Not anymore!Bootstrap tokens enable users to get a secure tokenand boot a Mac that uses FileVault.

This is a really useful feature if you used network accounts.

Bootstrap tokens improve the login workflowfor mobile accounts.

Once implemented, admins can take advantageof authorized software updates and kernel extensions.

Bootstrap tokens are supported on the latest Macswith Apple T2 Security Chip.

Please review developer documentation to learn moreabout bootstrap tokens in your deployment.

Now let's talk about how we took measures to protect users.

You might be asked to installa profile that was sent to you in an emailor one that was downloaded in a web page.

Since profiles can configure your device,we need to make sure that we don't install them accidentallyfrom people that you don't trust.

In iOS and iPadOS,we introduced downloaded profiles.

This is where we isolate a profile that's been downloaded.

We have you install it manually by paying a visit to Settings.

It's designed to help protect customers.

We're bringing downloaded profiles to the Macto offer the same security benefits.

When you download a profile, you'll receive a notificationthat you can review it in Settings.

Visit System Profiles paneand you'll see a new group labeled Downloaded Profiles.

Here you can preview the profile and click Install.

Confirm that you actually want to install itand enter your password to complete the installation.

Profiles can modify the way your device is configuredand we want users to take an informed decisionwhen installing them.

As an MDM developer,you're going to want to consider the challengesthat Downloaded Profiles poses to your deployment workflows.

Once a profile is downloaded,it remains in System Preferences for eight minutesbefore it is removed from the System Preferences pane.

As we informed you previously,we've continued to make security enhancementsthat impact several command line toolsthat you may be using in your deployment workflows.

As of macOS Big Sur, you will no longer be ableto completely install profiles using Terminal.

When you attempt to install a profile via the command line,it will treat it as if it was downloadedand you'll have to complete the installin the Profile System Preferences pane manually.

All other features of the Profiles command line toolwill remain the same and continue to work as expected.

In addition to changes to the Profiles command line tool,macOS Big Sur also includes a toolcalled networksetup that makes it easy to viewand edit your network settings using Terminal.

The problem is that admins and standard usershave the same abilities to view and modifynetwork settings from the command line.

We've now imbued these accounts types with different abilitieswhen using the networksetup tool.

We've also hardened security by honoring the settingthat requires your admin passwordwhen modifying system-wide preferences.

Here's some detail around networksetup tool.

Admins and standard users now have different capabilities.

Standard users can only read network settings,turn on and off Wi-Fi, and change the access point.

They no longer have the same unbridled capabilitiesthat admins do.

Tick the checkbox to require your passwordwhen modifying settings and security and privacybut admins can get around this by using sudo.

There's one more significant security enhancementthat you should be aware of.

Automated Device Enrollment uses device serial numbersto know which devices to enroll at activation.

Serial numbers contain bits of identifiable informationlike where and when the device was built.

These 12-character numbers help Appletarget devices made at the same time,in the same place, to maintain quality.

To address identifiable informationbeing used maliciously, we're going to start issuingcompletely random 10-character serial numbersacross our product line.

As an MDM vendor, you depend on automated device enrollmentand serial numbers to identify devices.

You'll need to take the new serial number format changeinto account within your products.

Third-party solutions must be capable of handlingboth the current product serial number formatsand the newly-updated format at the same time.

There are a number of other new device management features,restrictions, and commands that MDM vendorscan now take advantage of in macOS Big Sur.

Please consult our updated configuration profileand MDM protocol reference documentationat developer.apple.com to learn more.

It's a big year for the Mac,but the latest release of iOS and iPadOShave tons of great device management featuresincluded this year too.

From Shared iPad for Business and Temporary Sessionto Shortcuts now supporting Managed Open In,iOS and iPadOS have a ton to offer administrators.

Just like with Mac, we're going to focus onhow admins can deploy, manage, and secure iOS and iPadOS too.

Let's start with deployment.

When time is of the essence, Apple Configurator helps youmass configure iPhones, iPads, and Apple TVs fastusing a USB cable.

Apple Configurator now supports apps and books locationsthat are provided by Apple School Managerand Apple Business Manager.

Locations are different places where devices are kept.

For example, an institution may usea completely different set of apps and booksat an elementary school than they do at a high school.

With this new feature,admins can now go to the account menuand select the location they'd like to use.

That displays an entirely different set of apps and booksfor each location that has been configuredin Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager.

This is a critical feature for our customersand we're excited to introduce it.

In addition to locations, cfgutil is now more scalableand can restore larger numbers of devices than ever before.

And if you didn't notice, Apple Configuratorsports a brand new look in macOS Big Sur.

Now let's turn to a few more additions in iOS deployment.

Automated device enrollment enables youto customize the setup assistant to simplify MDM enrollmentand device setup.

It enables you to get to the Home screenwithout needing to use the setup assistant.

And we're adding new skip keys for the newGetting Started and Update Completed panes in iOS 14.

We've now brought the Setup Assistant payload to iOS,although it works a little differently than on macOS.

Using the payload, you specify the same skip keysyou use with automated device enrollmentand then they will take effect during future upgrades.

The payload offers two benefits.

First, it allows you to skip Setup Assistant panesduring an upgrade that you didn't know aboutwhen initially setting up the device.

And second, skipping the setup panes during upgradeis now possible on all supervised devices,not just those enrolled using Apple School Managerand Apple Business Manager.

I would now like to discuss one of my favoritedevice management features: Shared iPad.

It allows students to have a personal experienceon a shared device.

Shared iPad gives schools the ability to provideeach and every student with a personalized experienceand their own data, even if the students are sharing iPads.

Earlier this year, we added some great new featuresto expand the ways in which Shared iPadcan be used in different types of organizations,not only schools.

Shared iPad for Business can be configuredusing Apple Business Manager just as you do to configure itfor students in Apple School Manager.

Employees can sign into Shared iPadusing their managed Apple ID.

This is a great feature for service businessessuch as restaurants where you can deployshared devices to take orders from customers.

If you use Microsoft Azure Active Directory,your users can now sign in using federated authenticationand Shared iPad now supportsthe new single sign-on extension too.

But wait, there's more!Shared iPad now supports dynamic numbers of cached userswhich allows you to set the amount of storage for each userinstead of a fixed number of users.

You can also now delete all users from a shared iPad at onceand we have added queries for estimated resident usersand quota size.

And a highly requested feature called temporary session.

A temporary session further expands the way shared iPadcan be used in different organizationsby allowing a user to sign in temporarilywithout needing an account.

When you sign out, all the datathe user created during the session will be deleted.

It's a quick and easy way for people to startusing a shared iPad without a managed Apple ID.

Those are all the new deployment featureswe've introduced in iOS and iPadOS 14.

Now let's review what we're going to doto make managing iPhones and iPads even better.

First up is non-removable managed apps,a great new feature that admins will be excited about.

Previously, admins could completely lock the Home screenand prevent the deletion of all apps,which constrained the user's abilityto manage their own apps.

Now users can continue to rearrange their appsand install new appsand delete other apps that they've installed.

And admins can mark only mission-critical managed appsas non-removable.

When your users try to delete or offload a managed app,it prevents it and displays an alert.

Non-removable managed apps ensures that your usersalways have the apps they need on their devices.

You can now mark specific managed apps as non-removable,which will prevent the user from removing or offloading.

Just like organizations want to be able to havesome control over the apps on their employee's devices,they also want to keep a tight controlover their proprietary data.

And this year,we've added several new ways to maintain that control.

Let's start with a great new iOS productivity feature: Shortcuts.

Shortcuts deliver a quick wayyou can get things done with your appsor with just a tap by asking Siri.

By Shortcuts supporting Managed Open In,when a shortcut triggers an actionwhere data flow is not allowed because of the device policy,the shortcut will immediately stop running.

We do this by controlling the flow of datato make sure that managed data does not get sharedwith unmanaged apps and services and vice versa.

This makes certain that your organization's datadoes not fall into the wrong hands.

Building on preventing sensitive data from being shared,let's turn to notifications.

Organizations want to ensure that sensitive informationcannot be revealed without user intent,so we've added a setting to control Notification previewsto help.

It's a new key in the notification settings payloadcalled Preview Type,which controls when previews are shown in notifications:never, always, or only after the userhas unlocked their device.

The new key is only respected on supervised devicesand will help your organizationkeep your data private and secure.

Now I have just one more management featureI would like to share with youbefore we move on to our security features.

Managing remote devices around the worldis something that we are all becoming more familiar with.

Let's say you have employeesthat are located across multiple countriesand some of them don't use location.

It really doesn't make a lot of sensefor their devices to be configuredto use the time zone of your MDM server by default.

Time management of end pointsis a critical function of key services.

If set incorrectly, it could cause serious problemssuch as authentication issues.

So we're introducing the new Set Timezone MDM commandthat allows you to choose the time zone for each device.

And it's not dependent on Location Services whatsoever.

Make sure you review developer documentationto learn more about how you cantake advantage of this new command.

And those are just some of the new management featureswe are bringing to iOS and iPadOS 14 this year.

But what can we do to continue to improvethe security of your devices?In this section, we will cover some changes coming this yearthat will impact deployment workflowsas well as some new management capabilitiesyou can use to secure iPhones and iPads in your organization.

VPN, or virtual private networks,let people send and receive data across public networks.

There are three types of VPN that iOS supports:Full Tunnel, which all traffic can flow through;Split Tunnel,which chooses which traffic can flow through it;and we've added support for per-app VPN,which only lets certain apps' data flow through it.

Today, we're going to add support for youto choose which VPN your accounts should use.

This is called Per Account VPN for iOSand it allows you to choose a replacement VPNfor Contacts, Calendars, and Mail domains.

You can associate an individual account with VPNjust like you can the traffic of an app.

Developers only need to replace the keys in the Domain payloadto take advantage of this new feature.

Since we're on the topic of encrypted traffic,you can now encrypt your DNS too.

Most of our traffic is encrypted when we talk to a server.

But when we talk to a DNS server,those connections aren't secure.

So in addition to per account VPN,we're also introducing Encrypted DNS settings.

Encrypted DNS allows you to enhance securitywithout needing to configure VPN.

iOS already supports the standard for secure DNS.

Now we're providing the ability to manage it via MDM as well.

Let's talk about just one morenew security feature we've included this year.

Beginning in iOS 14,whenever a device associates with a Wi-Fi network,it will use a random MAC addressinstead of the device's true hardware MAC address.

For enterprise networks that use captive portals or filtering,the new feature may cause an unexpected behavioras the device may not be identified when it joins.

If the device fails to join the network,it will fall back to using its real MAC address.

While users can disable this feature in Settings,we've also made it possible to disable itusing the Wi-Fi payload.

As there were for macOS Big Sur,there are a number of other new device management features,restrictions, and commands that MDM vendorscan now take advantage of in iOS, iPad OS, and tvOS.

Please consult our updated configuration profileand MDM protocol reference documentationat developer.apple.com to learn more.

Thanks for joining me to learn what's newin managing Apple's devices at WWDC 2020.

We hope you'll take advantage of the great new featuresacross our platforms this year.

Thanks.
