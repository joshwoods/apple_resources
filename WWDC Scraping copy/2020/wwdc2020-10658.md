Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC.Hi, my name's Brianand I'm an engineer on the Apple Education team.Today I'll be talking about what Apple's been up to this year in education.For more than 40 years Apple's been working with educatorsto help them create rich and meaningful learning experiences.More recently, Apple's provided technologiesto support not just students and teachers,but IT and school administrators as well.And, of course, none of this would be possiblewithout the apps and content that developers provide.Since we launched the App Store,developers like you have built thousands of amazing educational appsfor the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac.We're committed to working with youto provide the best educational experiences for everyone.With that in mind, let's look at how education appsfit into the Apple ecosystem.There's a lot to cover. So, I'll spend a few minuteson the developer opportunities in each of these areas.Let's start with Schoolwork.Schoolwork makes it easy for teachers to share materials,assign activities and track student progress.The latest version of Schoolwork introduces a brand-new design.It's now even easier to switch between Handouts and Student views.This is the App Activity Chooser.It's where teachers can assign the Activitiesfrom your ClassKit enabled apps to a Handout.The Chooser now shows richer metadata for your Activitieswith the addition of thumbnails and summary info.Be sure to update your app to use the new metadata fields in ClassKit.The new Handout view provides insights into overall classand individual student progress.This view is driven by the Progress data that your app provides.As you can see here, your app can reporttime spent, percentage complete and quiz scores.Please see the ClassKit documentationfor a complete list of status reporting options.Schoolwork 2.0 has an all new design,Handout Library and Handout detail view.The Detail view is great for showing progress from your app's Activities.And there's also support for the new metadata fields,so you can show off the content like never before.If you want your app to work well with Schoolwork,you'll need to adopt the ClassKit Framework.Once you do, be sure to include all the metadata that you canand report any progress on Activities back to ClassKit.Schoolwork helps students and teachers easily tap intothe ecosystem of apps that you create.How do you do that? You do it with ClassKit.Let's dig into the latest ClassKit details.As you saw in Schoolwork, ClassKit is a framework for iOSthat lets your app content be assigned to a student.And your app can then report progress back to Schoolwork.Student data is very sensitive,and that's why ClassKit only reports Activitiesthat have been assigned in a Handout.And it's only available to certain people, like the student's teacher.Progress on any Activities that weren't assignedwill not be shared or displayed.For example, if a teacher gives a student the reading assignment"Fun with Science" in Apple Books,the time spent and reading progress will be reported for that item.If that student then also reads "Basic Arithmetic,"no status will be reportedbecause that was not assigned in a Handout.In order for app Activities to be displayed in the Activity Chooser,your app must first publish that datato ClassKit as a CLSContext.Typically, this happens after a teacher downloads your appand browses to an Activity.This works great for teachers that are already familiar with your content,and using your app, but what about those that aren't?That's why today we're introducing something new for Schoolworkcalled the ClassKit Catalog API.The ClassKit Catalog is a central storeof your app's public Activities.Assigning Activities from your appis no longer limited to the local context store.Now the only requirement will be that your app is installedand all of your Activities will be available from the Catalog.Using a web API, you can publish your Activitiesand they will be available from the Activity Chooser.The Catalog also includes new metadata fieldsthat'll make it easier for teachers to find your content.You can learn more about working with ClassKitand the new ClassKit Catalog API,by checking out this year's session "What's New in ClassKit."To get the most from ClassKit, make sure to report progress from your Activities.Include the thumbnails and other improved metadata,and submit your data to the ClassKit Catalog.Schoolwork, ClassKit and the new ClassKit Catalog APIare just the beginning of what we have for you today.Let's take a look at the service that brings all of our educational apps together.Apple School Manager, our simple, web-based portalfor schools to manage accounts, devices, and content,all from one place.With Apple School Manager,IT administrators can easily create classesand manage login credentials for teachers and students.There are also several options for streamlining this integrationwith Student Information Systems, SFTP,and federated authentication using Microsoft Active Directory.Enrolling devices into Mobile Device Management is easyand you don't have to physically touch devices before distributing them.Check out the session "What's New in Managing Apple Devices"to learn more about Apple School Manager.The Apps and Books section is where administratorscan purchase content for their schools.As a developer, you'll want to make sureit's easy to purchase and deploy your applications.To find out more about how best to sell your appto schools and businesses, check out the 2019 session"App Distribution - From Ad-hoc to Enterprise."Apple School Manager is a great way to connect your schoolto both Apple's ecosystem of products and servicesas well as the thousands of educational third-party appsfor the iPad, the iPhone and the Mac.And this year, it all works together.Apple School Manager, Schoolwork, and Classroomare more integrated than ever.Now classes created in Apple School Managerare automatically available in both Classroom and Schoolwork.And updates from Apple School Manager are synced down as well.When students sign in with their Managed Apple ID,they will automatically show up in Classroom,and they can see their Schoolwork classes.In addition to better integration with Apple School Manager,Classroom is getting a number of new features too.With Classroom, teachers can easily launch your appon every student's iPad at the same time.Or launch a different app for each group of students.Teachers can also easily see what students are up toby viewing their iPad screensand even take a closer look using pinch to zoom,which is new this spring.And if your app is ClassKit enabled,teachers can even launch your app with the right Activity already open.If you're a teacher, and you create your class in Classroom,you start your classand invite your students to join with a four-digit code.Now you can just tap the AirPlay Class Code button,and all your class info is instantly sharedwith your students on your Apple TV.New this year, classes created using Apple School Managerand Schoolwork will now show up instantly in Classroom.This fall, teachers will also be able to create their own classes in Classroomfor use in Apple School Manager and Schoolwork.Classroom added a bunch of new features this yearwith Apple School Manager class integration,AirPlay class invitations and pinch to zoom.You'll want to make sure that your app is ClassKit enabledto get the most from Classroom integration.Now that we've covered classroom management,how about the student login experience?That brings us to Shared iPad.With Shared iPad, students can quickly log into an iPadand use it as if it were their own device.Your app should behave on a Shared iPadjust like it would on a personal device,except the data must be synced from the cloud.When a student signs into a Shared iPad,you shouldn't expect that any of that user's data to be present,as the data may not be available after the student logs out.And new this fall, Shared iPad will offer Temporary Session.Shared iPad Temporary Session enables schools to deploy deviceswith standard configurations that students can use without sign-in credentials.Imagine that you're a student on your first day at a new schooland your accounts aren't ready yet.With Temporary Session, you can still grab an iPad and join the class.When you sign out, all the data created during that session will be deleted.With Temporary Session, no Apple ID is required to sign inand no data is retained after the end of the session.By default, Temporary Session is turned on.If you're an MDM developer,we've introduced a new supervised restrictionfor customers to choose to opt out of using Temporary Sessions.Remember, for your app to provide a good student experience,all data must be synced from the cloud.And when a student is done with the Shared iPad and logs out,your app needs to be ready to sync in the background.Using longLived CKOperationsand UIBackgroundTasks will make this possible.That brings us to the topic that all students love, taking tests.New in macOS this yearis the Automatic Assessment Configuration Framework.We introduced the ability for iPads to be usedin standardized testing in 2016.And we wanted to bring this feature to the Mac as well.The new Automatic Assessment Configuration Frameworkenables educational institutions to leverage the power of the Mac,while at the same time preventing studentsfrom using features that could give them an unfair advantage.The Automatic Assessment Configuration Frameworkallows you to provide a secure environmentfor your applications to deliver tests to students.The Framework is available on iOS, macOS and supports Catalyst as well.Test takers are locked into the testing appand features, such as Screen Sharing, Universal Clipboard or Dictationare automatically disabled for the duration of the test.To find out how your appcan take advantage of the new Assessment Framework,see this year's session, "What's New in Assessment."If you're developing a testing app on iOS or the Mac,you should consider adopting the Assessment Framework.You'll need to apply for a new entitlement,
