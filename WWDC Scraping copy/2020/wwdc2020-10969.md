Let's jump in with the first question.This comes from Michael from Phoenix, Arizona.Michael says Mythic Quest is absolutely my favorite show.That's a great start.That's a great start to this entire thing.BRAD: I'm loving this question.ROB MCELHENNEY: Mythic Quest is absolutely myfavorite show centered on development.MEGAN GANZ: Oh.ROB MCELHENNEY: That seems a little bit more -that seems -MEGAN GANZ: We're the only one.We're the only one, so.ROB MCELHENNEY: Fine. We'll take it.Michael, we'll take it.It feels so true to life.I'm curious how many consultants you worked withon creating the scripts?Meg, you want to take that?MEGAN GANZ: Yeah.Well, our first and foremost, like, our partnersin Mythic Quest are Ubisoft.So, we had constant communication with them.They were in the writers room with us.They were guiding the whole process, letting us know -introducing us to the world.On top of that, they also facilitated people from manydifferent studios coming to visit us.We had programmers.We had a monetization expert.We had writers.We had all sorts of different people come inand talk to us.My favorite of all of those people was the first femalecoder we spoke with who was just as surly as I wantedher to be.She was suffering no fools and not mincing words abouther experience and I absolutely loved everysecond of talking to her.ROB MCELHENNEY: That was a really fun experiencebecause she seemed very upset.MEGAN GANZ: Yeah.ROB MCELHENNEY: She was very upset, I think mostlyby the portrayal that she had seen of programmers on -on various television shows or movies that we had seenand she was like, you guys better get it right.So, I hope we got it right.Okay. This comes from Patricia from Oakland, California.I freaking love watching - I mean, two for two.Two for two. I freaking love - it's a good start.I freaking love watching the dysfunctional relationshipbetween Poppy and Ian.It's honestly so validating to see conversations Iwitnessed over my career acted out on screen.As you were developing these characters, what's one thingthat struck you as truly bizarro in tech culture?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: You know, one thing that didfeel bizarre to me, especially with Ian andPoppy's relationship, is like, the - the fact thatshe literally builds everything and yet he'sconsidered to be the genius.I enjoyed playing with that in their relationship.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.This is a question that comes from Valentin fromMössingen, Germany.As a fifteen-year-old that is heavily inspired bybooks, movies, and TV shows, what are some of your tipsfor getting into the business of storytelling,particularly through movies and TV shows?IMANI HAKIM: I would say no matter where you are inthe world, to find your community, find people whoare already involved in the space that you want tooperate in, and read books.Study.Watch more movies like you're already doing.But I think mainly just find the community where you canlearn and pick up new tools from people who are alreadyinvolved in it.DANNY PUDI: I would say, yeah.Practice telling your story.I think that's really important.The more you work on telling your story or juststorytelling in general, whether that's working onvideos for your family or practicing jokes in thebathroom in front of your mirror, not that I do that.I have some friends who do that.But those things all help you hone in on your voice,so I think that's good.And then yeah, like what Imani said, is findyour people.Find people who are working on aspects of storytellingthat you're not, so writers, directors.Form a little crew and work together to help each otherget better.ROB MCELHENNEY: Next question comes from Russia.All right. Ilya from Moscow, Russia.Lots of love from Russia.My question is, do any of the cast members have anycoding experience at all in real life?Anybody?IMANI HAKIM: No.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: When I - when I got cast, I signedup to a - to a - like an online school, like freecoding school called Code Academy, thinking like, Iwould, you know, just learn the basics and then I'd havelike a kind of understanding that I could use in myportrayal of the character.And I think I tried to do one lesson before I waslike, no. I can't do it.And I still get emails from them being like, pick upwhere you left off.And it makes me feel really guilty and really stupid.MEGAN GANZ: I learned the words server/clientarchitecture.I don't know what it means but I know it's a thing thatI think programmers care about.We - we need to get better about it because - becausewe have partners in Ubisoft, what we do is in the script,whenever there are moments where Poppy needs todescribe what it is that she's actually doing, wejust write the word haptics over and over because weheard that word once and we were like, oh,that sounds techy.So, we just write haptics, haptics, haptics and thenthe good people at Ubisoft go through the scripts andreplace those with actual language that you might use.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.Oh, here's a question from Portugal.From Viseu, Portugal.This person's name is João.And they would like to know, which episode did you havethe most fun filming?Imani, which episode did you have the most fun filming?IMANI HAKIM: Oh.I would say all of the episodes were really fun butI think the one that stands out to me the most obviouslyis the - the montage episode.Was that number two, I believe?Episode number two.Rachel and Dana, they have this fun montage and it wasjust really fun to shoot and it's one of myfavorite memories.ROB MCELHENNEY: Hey, Danny.I have a question for you and it - and it hails fromMelbourne, Australia.And yes, Charlotte, you'll get an opportunity to answerit as well.But I don't know.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Melbourne.DANNY PUDI: Charlotte, you can take any Chicagoquestions from now on.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Good. I've been studying up.ROB MCELHENNEY: If you were to create an app ora game, what would it be and why, asks Yuma fromMelbourne, Australia.DANNY PUDI: One app that I actually use, I use thisapp which is a plant recognition app that I loveand it is - literally I just ride my bike around theneighborhood and I take out my phone and I'm like, lookat that tree.I wonder what kind of tree that is.And I like, snap a picture of it and they're like, oh,this is a pepper tree.I'll be like oh, wow.That's so cool.And that's super exciting for me.So, I think something dealing with like, plants ormaybe how to successfully make plants live would bereally kind of cool for me to do.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay, so, Charlotte, it's clear thatDanny blew that opportunity to take a question.So, we're going to - we're going to kick it to you,being from Melbourne, Australia.We'll ask it again.If you were to create an app or a game, what would itbe and why?And how would it be different from Danny'splant app?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Okay, see, I actually have ananswer to this question.And it's going to - it's on record now that it's my ideaso if anyone steals it, you know that it was me.It's a dating app but instead of like, answeringquestions about yourself, you get showna series of memes.You decide which memes you think are funny and then youget matched with people who also find those memes funny.DANNY PUDI: Oh.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: And it's called - I'm trying tothink of a pun on the fly.It's called You and Meme.ROB MCELHENNEY: That's pretty good.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: It'll have a better name than that.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay, so, this comes from DJ from AnnArbor, Michigan.What apps did you use to shoot the quarantine episode?I believe I can answer that.We used - for our camera app, we used somethingcalled Filmic Pro version 6.10.9 I believe.And it's just incredibly easy to use.But what you're seeing mixed with the hardware of theiPhone has created a professional grade look thatyou saw in the quarantine episode.And then the audio was - was an app called MOTIV Audioversion 2.62.1 or something like that which would justbe the most recent version.And again, it worked really seamlessly with thecamera package.And a mic system - that hardware there was calledShure Mic MV88 Plus.And that worked really seamlessly with the hardwareas well and - and really, that's - that's how weachieved 99.9% of the - of the technical elementsof the show.So, that's the boring stuff.Now moving on.Well, it's Developers Conference so you kind ofwant the boring stuff.So, we'll mix it in a little bit.This is a question from Leonard from Singapore.Charlotte, is there a scene that you personallyreally liked?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: No.ROB MCELHENNEY: Great. Moving on.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Yes. So many scenes.My top - my top scenes, I loved shooting the mocapstuff in the masked man episode with you, Rob.And I also loved - you know what?I'm realizing now all my favorite scenes are when Igot to wear silly costumes because I also lovedshooting at the streamer conference, pretty muchanything where I got to wear that masked man costume andespecially the scene where I was sitting in a beanbag.Like, I don't think I even had any lines in that scene.I just enjoyed sitting in that beanbag in my costume.ROB MCELHENNEY: The next question is from Henry fromKensington, Maryland.Danny, for the quarantine episode, you had to be yourown lighting designer, audio team, camera person,et cetera.Which crew role did you turn out to be a natural at andwhich one not so much?DANNY PUDI: Great question.So, another app that I'm working on is the best placeto take a picnic and it's designed to look at -ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay. Moving on.Thank you, Danny. Thank you, Danny, for that.Imani.IMANI HAKIM: Yes?ROB MCELHENNEY: For the quarantine episode, you hadto be your own lighting designer, audio team, cameraperson, et cetera.Which crew role did you turn out to be a natural at andwhich one not so much?IMANI HAKIM: I would say I was - I was the mostnatural at maybe sound and the glam.I think because - I've had more practice at doing myown makeup so that came a little bit more natural.And the things that I wasn't the most natural at is forsome reason we had to check our settings multiple timesand it just - I couldn't remember.So, I applaud all of the DPs and all of the hard workersin the crew because it was - it was weird for me.ROB MCELHENNEY: Charlotte?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: I'm the opposite of Imani.I was absolutely the bane of our hair and makeup team'sexistence, I think.Even getting ready for this today was just anightmare for them.I don't know why.I think - I was joking with Thea, our makeup artist,that my sister started doing makeup when she wasa teenager so she's really good at it and I starteddoing makeup like since quarantine started and I hadto start doing it myself for stuff like this.ROB MCELHENNEY: Imani, this is a question againfrom Australia and we're just not going to letCharlotte answer any of these.Jimmy in Sydney, Australia asks, you used multipleiPhones to shoot this, right?I'm curious on how to control all of them at thesame time and how the director was able to see theshooting in progress in real-time.Imani, can you maybe just walk us through from yourperspective, what it was like and how we - how wecreated the setup in which we could work?IMANI HAKIM: Yeah.So, Apple sent over a ton of equipment for the actors touse, from iPhones to sound equipment to lighting.And the way that we were able to have Rob direct theepisode and see everything that's going on, we had - wehad all the crew members and the actors in the scenes onZoom where we would have our iPhones on this really coolcontraption and it would - it would show the screen tothe people in the Zoom and they were able to watch whatwe were doing through the iPhones.It's a lot but it worked really, really great.ROB MCELHENNEY: And from your perspective, one of thethings I keep getting asked about was because also wewere - we were communicating through AirPods, and a lotof - and we could barely see each other because even inthe rig that we have setup right now, we can't reallysee each other because we're blocked by so manydifferent things.And people were asking, what was it like to work with notonly your other actors in a scene butalso direct people?And I found that in some ways, it was a little bitmore intimate because you're so - obviously as actors,we're trained to listen to what other people are sayingand react to that.But oftentimes what happens is because of so muchnonverbal communication, you're assuming what aperson is going to say or you're feeling it beforethey even say it and it doesn't necessarily allowfor you to listen to the extent that you couldor should be.And when you're limited by not being able to seesomebody but just hear them, it almost opens up anotherform of communication because you have to reallypay attention to every word and to the tenorof their voice.Did - did all of you guys find something similar?IMANI HAKIM: Yeah.I think to your point, Rob, I think it - like you said,it really forces you to sort of drop in and be moreconnected than what - what you would usually be.Like, we're pretty - we're pretty connected on set butthere was something about this where we know thatwe're counting on each other through the scene to getthis story across, to get this scene across in a waywith barriers that we've never experienced before.So, it's almost like it forces you to have thissense of camaraderie and community and to show up foreach other in ways that you didn't necessarily expect.DANNY PUDI: Yeah.I would say also, it does make you listen a little bitmore to the rhythm of scenes in terms of how lines arecoming through.There is this sort of delicate balance of makingsure that we're speaking in a way that is natural butalso not overlapping too much, not - I think therewas just a little bit of a worry on my part ofsometimes the wi-fi signal not being super strong andworried that I either missed the end of the line orI jumped it.And so, there's this like, hyper listening but alsojust sort of like, almost like at times, I was justrelying on sort of like an instinct of jumping in on aline just when I felt like I think this is the right timeto say this line.But you're just hyper aware of people finishingthoughts, right?And so, that was kind of a really interesting gamewithin the game.ROB MCELHENNEY: Great.Meg, this one comes from Tukwila, Washington.A gentleman named Rick wants to know what is the mostvaluable lesson you've learned about the industry?MEGAN GANZ: I would say like the presence of womenin the video game industry.I - I had no - I kind of - I had no idea that there weresuch an equivalent amount of women playing video gamesand I guess you just don't hear about it and it feelslike a lot, when I was growing up, the marketingwas so directed towards men that I guess I alwaysassumed that that was who was playing.And now, I'm being - my eyes are being opened to anentire world of women not only playing these games butalso making them and - and Ashly Burch who plays Rachelon the show who is you know, heavily involved in thegaming community and has done voice overs for a lotof great games, has introduced me to a couplegames that are just, I feel, a little bit more feminineoriented and that I just sort of didn't understandthat there was that space in gaming.So, it's been a real delight.Also, just the narrative that modern games, like,their ability to tell complex and meaningful anddeep stories.I mean, we - my husband and I are just playing The Lastof Us 2 now and it is, I mean, breathtaking.Like, I can't play it before I go to bed because it hasthat much of an effect on me and I previously I guess,only thought that that was possible with movies and TV.So, that's been real eye opening.ROB MCELHENNEY: This hails from Charlotte, NorthCarolina which again, we will not allow Charlotteto answer.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: But -ROB MCELHENNEY: From Nick, the most unexpectedresponse you've gotten from someone about the show.And I'm kidding.Charlotte, handle it. Go.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Oh, I want to think about it though.Does anyone have an answer quicker than me?Wait, what was the question?I was just thinking about my name.DANNY PUDI: It's Charlotte.ROB MCELHENNEY: Your name is Charlotte.DANNY PUDI: It's Charlotte.ROB MCELHENNEY: Yeah.DANNY PUDI: It's always - right? It's always been?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Yeah, yeah.DANNY PUDI: Still is.MEGAN GANZ: Danny, can you make an app forCharlotte that can remember her name for her so that shedoesn't have to waste valuable time rememberingwhat her name is?DANNY PUDI: Already on it. Name rememberer.Already on it.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay. I'll repeat the question.Nick from Charlotte, North Carolina would like to know,what's the most unexpected response you've gotten fromsomeone about the show?Anybody?Anybody not named Charlotte or named Charlotte?MEGAN GANZ: My mom really likes it which I wasn'tnecessarily expecting because the past shows thatI've worked on, she usually says they talk too fast.That's her major complaint.And I feel like we talk pretty fast on the show butshe still really likes it.She's never played video games and has nointerest in them.So, I think she just likes CW and she's just showing upfor that which is great.We'll take it.ROB MCELHENNEY: I think for - for me, I think it was- I believe it was the same day, I saw two tweets insupport of the show, one from Elon Musk and one fromBarry Jenkins.I thought that was a really great day for the show.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Yeah.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay. Megan Ganz, we have a questionfrom Wilton, Connecticut.John Paul wants to know what was the most eye-openingslash surprising thing about shooting on iPhones?MEGAN GANZ: Oh, well, I had some experience shootingon iPhones before because I did an episode of ModernFamily that was shot about half on iPhones and -ROB MCELHENNEY: We're not here to talk about your Emmywinning endeavors, okay?We're here to talk about your Apple show onMythic Quest.So - Meg likes - Meg likes to bring up all of the showsshe won Emmys for except for the ones that she workswith me on.MEGAN GANZ: All of them. One.I - aside from that award-winning show,my experience, I mean, it's kind of incredible, the easeat which - the - how easy they are to use.I mean, I have zero idea of what I'm doing as a directorof photography, even maybe less than I knowabout programming.And the fact that with just a few settings on the phone,we can produce footage that looks absolutely equivalentto the footage that we get from on set with the giantcameras is just phenomenal.You know, it's - it's really - has removed all barriersto the - to the filmmaking process.It's - if you would have told people thirty years agothat they would have gotten this kind of quality out ofa phone that's in their pocket, they just would havenever believed you.So, I mean, it was a fantastic experience for me.I am actually planning at the moment, of shooting somemore stuff on iPhones that's not even - not evennecessarily when we're in quarantine because I justwas so pleased with the result.So, I encourage anybody that is thinking about makingsomething, especially if you are looking at getting intothe industry, I don't think you should wait to make yourmistakes once you've gotten the job.I think you should start shooting things now, editthem together, see what they look like.Shoot it again.Reedit it.Like, see where your mistakes are because you'llbe developing skills and making your mistakes when itdoesn't count and then hopefully when you get theopportunity to make a cool episode like we did, you'llhave gotten some of those mistakes out of your system.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.Well, that seems like a great place to finish up.Again, on behalf of the entire Mythic Quest team,thank you for having us at the WWDC this year.Have a great time.DANNY PUDI: Thank you.MEGAN GANZ: Bye.DANNY PUDI: Bye everyone.IMANI HAKIM: Happy Dub-Dub. >> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Dub-Dub.

Fine.Brad, go.BRAD: Yeah. Hey, everybody.So, I had this bet with David and well, he totallysandbagged and lost on purpose, but then we madethe stakes really high and we played one final time andwell, I still beat his a**.SPEAKER: Oh. David.SPEAKER: David, is that you?DANA: You look weird.SPEAKER: You look like an egg.DAVID: I know I look weird, okay.SUE: You look like a baby turtle.LOU: Wait, is that David or Sandy Duncan?DAVID: But it'll grow back in like eight orten months.I don't know. Has anyone ever shaved their eyebrow?I don't know how long that takes.Does it grow back? Whatever.It doesn't matter.I just - I feel bad that I lost the $300,000for charity.BRAD: I already donated it.DAVID: What?BRAD: Yeah, I was always going to donate it.DAVID: What?BRAD: Ian doubled it. IAN: Yo.DAVID: But why?I thought you were opposed to giving away money?BRAD: No, no, no.I told you I need to get something out of it which I did.Your dignity.That's $600,000 for charity.Way to go, David.SPEAKER: Way to go, David.SPEAKER: Good job, David.

I freaking love - it's a good start.I freaking love watching the dysfunctional relationshipbetween Poppy and Ian.It's honestly so validating to see conversations Iwitnessed over my career acted out on screen.As you were developing these characters, what's one thingthat struck you as truly bizarro in tech culture?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: You know, one thing that didfeel bizarre to me, especially with Ian andPoppy's relationship, is like, the - the fact thatshe literally builds everything and yet he'sconsidered to be the genius.I enjoyed playing with that in their relationship.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.This is a question that comes from Valentin fromMössingen, Germany.As a fifteen-year-old that is heavily inspired bybooks, movies, and TV shows, what are some of your tipsfor getting into the business of storytelling,particularly through movies and TV shows?IMANI HAKIM: I would say no matter where you are inthe world, to find your community, find people whoare already involved in the space that you want tooperate in, and read books.Study.Watch more movies like you're already doing.But I think mainly just find the community where you canlearn and pick up new tools from people who are alreadyinvolved in it.DANNY PUDI: I would say, yeah.Practice telling your story.I think that's really important.The more you work on telling your story or juststorytelling in general, whether that's working onvideos for your family or practicing jokes in thebathroom in front of your mirror, not that I do that.I have some friends who do that.But those things all help you hone in on your voice,so I think that's good.And then yeah, like what Imani said, is findyour people.Find people who are working on aspects of storytellingthat you're not, so writers, directors.Form a little crew and work together to help each otherget better.ROB MCELHENNEY: Next question comes from Russia.All right. Ilya from Moscow, Russia.Lots of love from Russia.My question is, do any of the cast members have anycoding experience at all in real life?Anybody?IMANI HAKIM: No.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: When I - when I got cast, I signedup to a - to a - like an online school, like freecoding school called Code Academy, thinking like, Iwould, you know, just learn the basics and then I'd havelike a kind of understanding that I could use in myportrayal of the character.And I think I tried to do one lesson before I waslike, no. I can't do it.And I still get emails from them being like, pick upwhere you left off.And it makes me feel really guilty and really stupid.MEGAN GANZ: I learned the words server/clientarchitecture.I don't know what it means but I know it's a thing thatI think programmers care about.We - we need to get better about it because - becausewe have partners in Ubisoft, what we do is in the script,whenever there are moments where Poppy needs todescribe what it is that she's actually doing, wejust write the word haptics over and over because weheard that word once and we were like, oh,that sounds techy.So, we just write haptics, haptics, haptics and thenthe good people at Ubisoft go through the scripts andreplace those with actual language that you might use.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.Oh, here's a question from Portugal.From Viseu, Portugal.This person's name is João.And they would like to know, which episode did you havethe most fun filming?Imani, which episode did you have the most fun filming?IMANI HAKIM: Oh.I would say all of the episodes were really fun butI think the one that stands out to me the most obviouslyis the - the montage episode.Was that number two, I believe?Episode number two.Rachel and Dana, they have this fun montage and it wasjust really fun to shoot and it's one of myfavorite memories.ROB MCELHENNEY: Hey, Danny.I have a question for you and it - and it hails fromMelbourne, Australia.And yes, Charlotte, you'll get an opportunity to answerit as well.But I don't know.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Melbourne.DANNY PUDI: Charlotte, you can take any Chicagoquestions from now on.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Good. I've been studying up.ROB MCELHENNEY: If you were to create an app ora game, what would it be and why, asks Yuma fromMelbourne, Australia.DANNY PUDI: One app that I actually use, I use thisapp which is a plant recognition app that I loveand it is - literally I just ride my bike around theneighborhood and I take out my phone and I'm like, lookat that tree.I wonder what kind of tree that is.And I like, snap a picture of it and they're like, oh,this is a pepper tree.I'll be like oh, wow.That's so cool.And that's super exciting for me.So, I think something dealing with like, plants ormaybe how to successfully make plants live would bereally kind of cool for me to do.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay, so, Charlotte, it's clear thatDanny blew that opportunity to take a question.So, we're going to - we're going to kick it to you,being from Melbourne, Australia.We'll ask it again.If you were to create an app or a game, what would itbe and why?And how would it be different from Danny'splant app?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Okay, see, I actually have ananswer to this question.And it's going to - it's on record now that it's my ideaso if anyone steals it, you know that it was me.It's a dating app but instead of like, answeringquestions about yourself, you get showna series of memes.You decide which memes you think are funny and then youget matched with people who also find those memes funny.DANNY PUDI: Oh.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: And it's called - I'm trying tothink of a pun on the fly.It's called You and Meme.ROB MCELHENNEY: That's pretty good.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: It'll have a better name than that.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay, so, this comes from DJ from AnnArbor, Michigan.What apps did you use to shoot the quarantine episode?I believe I can answer that.We used - for our camera app, we used somethingcalled Filmic Pro version 6.10.9 I believe.And it's just incredibly easy to use.But what you're seeing mixed with the hardware of theiPhone has created a professional grade look thatyou saw in the quarantine episode.And then the audio was - was an app called MOTIV Audioversion 2.62.1 or something like that which would justbe the most recent version.And again, it worked really seamlessly with thecamera package.And a mic system - that hardware there was calledShure Mic MV88 Plus.And that worked really seamlessly with the hardwareas well and - and really, that's - that's how weachieved 99.9% of the - of the technical elementsof the show.So, that's the boring stuff.Now moving on.Well, it's Developers Conference so you kind ofwant the boring stuff.So, we'll mix it in a little bit.This is a question from Leonard from Singapore.Charlotte, is there a scene that you personallyreally liked?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: No.ROB MCELHENNEY: Great. Moving on.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Yes. So many scenes.My top - my top scenes, I loved shooting the mocapstuff in the masked man episode with you, Rob.And I also loved - you know what?I'm realizing now all my favorite scenes are when Igot to wear silly costumes because I also lovedshooting at the streamer conference, pretty muchanything where I got to wear that masked man costume andespecially the scene where I was sitting in a beanbag.Like, I don't think I even had any lines in that scene.I just enjoyed sitting in that beanbag in my costume.ROB MCELHENNEY: The next question is from Henry fromKensington, Maryland.Danny, for the quarantine episode, you had to be yourown lighting designer, audio team, camera person,et cetera.Which crew role did you turn out to be a natural at andwhich one not so much?DANNY PUDI: Great question.So, another app that I'm working on is the best placeto take a picnic and it's designed to look at -ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay. Moving on.Thank you, Danny. Thank you, Danny, for that.Imani.IMANI HAKIM: Yes?ROB MCELHENNEY: For the quarantine episode, you hadto be your own lighting designer, audio team, cameraperson, et cetera.Which crew role did you turn out to be a natural at andwhich one not so much?IMANI HAKIM: I would say I was - I was the mostnatural at maybe sound and the glam.I think because - I've had more practice at doing myown makeup so that came a little bit more natural.And the things that I wasn't the most natural at is forsome reason we had to check our settings multiple timesand it just - I couldn't remember.So, I applaud all of the DPs and all of the hard workersin the crew because it was - it was weird for me.ROB MCELHENNEY: Charlotte?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: I'm the opposite of Imani.I was absolutely the bane of our hair and makeup team'sexistence, I think.Even getting ready for this today was just anightmare for them.I don't know why.I think - I was joking with Thea, our makeup artist,that my sister started doing makeup when she wasa teenager so she's really good at it and I starteddoing makeup like since quarantine started and I hadto start doing it myself for stuff like this.ROB MCELHENNEY: Imani, this is a question againfrom Australia and we're just not going to letCharlotte answer any of these.Jimmy in Sydney, Australia asks, you used multipleiPhones to shoot this, right?I'm curious on how to control all of them at thesame time and how the director was able to see theshooting in progress in real-time.Imani, can you maybe just walk us through from yourperspective, what it was like and how we - how wecreated the setup in which we could work?IMANI HAKIM: Yeah.So, Apple sent over a ton of equipment for the actors touse, from iPhones to sound equipment to lighting.And the way that we were able to have Rob direct theepisode and see everything that's going on, we had - wehad all the crew members and the actors in the scenes onZoom where we would have our iPhones on this really coolcontraption and it would - it would show the screen tothe people in the Zoom and they were able to watch whatwe were doing through the iPhones.It's a lot but it worked really, really great.ROB MCELHENNEY: And from your perspective, one of thethings I keep getting asked about was because also wewere - we were communicating through AirPods, and a lotof - and we could barely see each other because even inthe rig that we have setup right now, we can't reallysee each other because we're blocked by so manydifferent things.And people were asking, what was it like to work with notonly your other actors in a scene butalso direct people?And I found that in some ways, it was a little bitmore intimate because you're so - obviously as actors,we're trained to listen to what other people are sayingand react to that.But oftentimes what happens is because of so muchnonverbal communication, you're assuming what aperson is going to say or you're feeling it beforethey even say it and it doesn't necessarily allowfor you to listen to the extent that you couldor should be.And when you're limited by not being able to seesomebody but just hear them, it almost opens up anotherform of communication because you have to reallypay attention to every word and to the tenorof their voice.Did - did all of you guys find something similar?IMANI HAKIM: Yeah.I think to your point, Rob, I think it - like you said,it really forces you to sort of drop in and be moreconnected than what - what you would usually be.Like, we're pretty - we're pretty connected on set butthere was something about this where we know thatwe're counting on each other through the scene to getthis story across, to get this scene across in a waywith barriers that we've never experienced before.So, it's almost like it forces you to have thissense of camaraderie and community and to show up foreach other in ways that you didn't necessarily expect.DANNY PUDI: Yeah.I would say also, it does make you listen a little bitmore to the rhythm of scenes in terms of how lines arecoming through.There is this sort of delicate balance of makingsure that we're speaking in a way that is natural butalso not overlapping too much, not - I think therewas just a little bit of a worry on my part ofsometimes the wi-fi signal not being super strong andworried that I either missed the end of the line orI jumped it.And so, there's this like, hyper listening but alsojust sort of like, almost like at times, I was justrelying on sort of like an instinct of jumping in on aline just when I felt like I think this is the right timeto say this line.But you're just hyper aware of people finishingthoughts, right?And so, that was kind of a really interesting gamewithin the game.ROB MCELHENNEY: Great.Meg, this one comes from Tukwila, Washington.A gentleman named Rick wants to know what is the mostvaluable lesson you've learned about the industry?MEGAN GANZ: I would say like the presence of womenin the video game industry.I - I had no - I kind of - I had no idea that there weresuch an equivalent amount of women playing video gamesand I guess you just don't hear about it and it feelslike a lot, when I was growing up, the marketingwas so directed towards men that I guess I alwaysassumed that that was who was playing.And now, I'm being - my eyes are being opened to anentire world of women not only playing these games butalso making them and - and Ashly Burch who plays Rachelon the show who is you know, heavily involved in thegaming community and has done voice overs for a lotof great games, has introduced me to a couplegames that are just, I feel, a little bit more feminineoriented and that I just sort of didn't understandthat there was that space in gaming.So, it's been a real delight.Also, just the narrative that modern games, like,their ability to tell complex and meaningful anddeep stories.I mean, we - my husband and I are just playing The Lastof Us 2 now and it is, I mean, breathtaking.Like, I can't play it before I go to bed because it hasthat much of an effect on me and I previously I guess,only thought that that was possible with movies and TV.So, that's been real eye opening.ROB MCELHENNEY: This hails from Charlotte, NorthCarolina which again, we will not allow Charlotteto answer.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: But -ROB MCELHENNEY: From Nick, the most unexpectedresponse you've gotten from someone about the show.And I'm kidding.Charlotte, handle it. Go.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Oh, I want to think about it though.Does anyone have an answer quicker than me?Wait, what was the question?I was just thinking about my name.

DANNY PUDI: It's Charlotte.ROB MCELHENNEY: Your name is Charlotte.DANNY PUDI: It's Charlotte.ROB MCELHENNEY: Yeah.DANNY PUDI: It's always - right? It's always been?CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Yeah, yeah.DANNY PUDI: Still is.MEGAN GANZ: Danny, can you make an app forCharlotte that can remember her name for her so that shedoesn't have to waste valuable time rememberingwhat her name is?DANNY PUDI: Already on it. Name rememberer.Already on it.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay. I'll repeat the question.Nick from Charlotte, North Carolina would like to know,what's the most unexpected response you've gotten fromsomeone about the show?Anybody?Anybody not named Charlotte or named Charlotte?MEGAN GANZ: My mom really likes it which I wasn'tnecessarily expecting because the past shows thatI've worked on, she usually says they talk too fast.That's her major complaint.And I feel like we talk pretty fast on the show butshe still really likes it.She's never played video games and has nointerest in them.So, I think she just likes CW and she's just showing upfor that which is great.We'll take it.ROB MCELHENNEY: I think for - for me, I think it was- I believe it was the same day, I saw two tweets insupport of the show, one from Elon Musk and one fromBarry Jenkins.I thought that was a really great day for the show.CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Yeah.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay. Megan Ganz, we have a questionfrom Wilton, Connecticut.John Paul wants to know what was the most eye-openingslash surprising thing about shooting on iPhones?MEGAN GANZ: Oh, well, I had some experience shootingon iPhones before because I did an episode of ModernFamily that was shot about half on iPhones and -ROB MCELHENNEY: We're not here to talk about your Emmywinning endeavors, okay?We're here to talk about your Apple show onMythic Quest.So - Meg likes - Meg likes to bring up all of the showsshe won Emmys for except for the ones that she workswith me on.MEGAN GANZ: All of them. One.I - aside from that award-winning show,my experience, I mean, it's kind of incredible, the easeat which - the - how easy they are to use.I mean, I have zero idea of what I'm doing as a directorof photography, even maybe less than I knowabout programming.And the fact that with just a few settings on the phone,we can produce footage that looks absolutely equivalentto the footage that we get from on set with the giantcameras is just phenomenal.You know, it's - it's really - has removed all barriersto the - to the filmmaking process.It's - if you would have told people thirty years agothat they would have gotten this kind of quality out ofa phone that's in their pocket, they just would havenever believed you.So, I mean, it was a fantastic experience for me.I am actually planning at the moment, of shooting somemore stuff on iPhones that's not even - not evennecessarily when we're in quarantine because I justwas so pleased with the result.So, I encourage anybody that is thinking about makingsomething, especially if you are looking at getting intothe industry, I don't think you should wait to make yourmistakes once you've gotten the job.I think you should start shooting things now, editthem together, see what they look like.Shoot it again.Reedit it.Like, see where your mistakes are because you'llbe developing skills and making your mistakes when itdoesn't count and then hopefully when you get theopportunity to make a cool episode like we did, you'llhave gotten some of those mistakes out of your system.ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.Well, that seems like a great place to finish up.Again, on behalf of the entire Mythic Quest team,thank you for having us at the WWDC this year.Have a great time.DANNY PUDI: Thank you.MEGAN GANZ: Bye.DANNY PUDI: Bye everyone.IMANI HAKIM: Happy Dub-Dub. >> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Dub-Dub.
