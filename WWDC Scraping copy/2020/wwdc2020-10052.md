Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC.Hello and welcome. I'm Eric Dudiak, an engineer on the UIKit team.And I'll be joined by David Duncan.We're going to be talking about some great new features of UIKitwith a focus on standard controls and menus.So, let's get started.Here's a quick overviewof what we're going to be covering in this session.We'll take a brief look at some of the recent changes in control appearances.After that, we'll go over the new color picker and how to use it.Then we'll take a look at the updated date picker.We'll also look at how menus have changed and added more options.Finally, we'll go over improvements around UIActionsthat can significantly simplify your code.So let's get started with the appearance updates to some common controls,and these apply across iOS and iPadOS,in both UIKit and their SwiftUI counterparts.UISlider and UIProgressView have both received minor updatesto make them more consistent across all of the platforms.First, you'll notice the thickness of the track has been increased,bringing the appearance more in line with macOS.Along with the appearance changes, UISlider now adopts the macOS behaviorof being able to tap or click on the track to adjust the value.Here we see the matching visual change on UIProgressView.When using these and other UIKit controls in an optimized Catalyst app,they will further adopt the macOS appearance.This further adoption will limit some of the customization APIs of these controls,and they will have no effect.For more information about the considerationswhen making an optimized Catalyst app,check out the "Optimize the Interface of your Mac Catalyst App" session.The next control to receive an appearance updateis UIActivityIndicatorView.The new design features fewer petals and is consistent across all sizes,along with some timing adjustments on the animation.Now, it is important to always use the built-in UIActivityIndicatorViewwhen showing indeterminate progress.This ensures consistency.Now, to ensure it works in all possible scenarios,use the modern styles that adjust for Dark Modeand optionally allow setting a custom color via the API.Similar appearance changes have also been made in the pull-to-refresh control.And here we see the optimized Mac Catalyst version of theseand a few other standard controls.Notice that they match the appearance of standard Mac controls.UIPickerView has also received an update in its appearance.It should be noted, however, that menus may be an appropriate replacementin many contexts.We'll discuss them a little bit later in this session.On Catalyst apps on macOS, menus are almost always the best choicewhen you're presenting a selection from a number of choices.The last control we'll go over is UIPageControl.Now, it has received both appearance changesand some functional changes.The new appearance allows the page control to support an unlimited number of pageswithin a fixed size.Now when the number of pages exceed the space available,the control allows for the scrubbing and scrolling of those pages,making the control more ideal for scenarioswhere user customization may dictate the number of pages,such as on the Home Screen.Additionally, the page control features new API to customize its appearance.The indicators themselves can now be set to custom imageseither for individual pages or all of the pages.This can be useful if a certain page has a special function,such as the first page in the Weather app shown here,which shows the current location icon for the weather.The presentation and interaction of the control can also be customized,such as setting the control to display in a more prominent modewhen it is the main control of an interface.So, let's take a look at how we use these customizations.Here we go ahead and create our pageControl.We can then set the backgroundStyle to prominent,so that it'll stand out better in the context of our app.This will make the background area always show,instead of just when we're interacting with it.We can also set the default image for all the indicatorsif we don't want the normal circles.In this case, setting the bookmark imagefor a case where we are browsing pages of bookmarks.We can also further customize individual pages.Here we're doing that with the heart image on the first pageto indicate that it is for favorites.All of the other API surface of the pageControlremains completely unchanged.Next up, let's take a look at the new color picker in iOS 14.For those already familiar with the macOS color panel,the new color picker in iPadOS and iOS 14 will feel very similar.The color picker is a view controller that can be easily presentedas a sheet or popover from your application.In addition to typical delegate callbacks,it has a color property that can be set and read to configure it.Once presented,it allows selecting a color through a number of different methods,such as picking from a grid...selecting a color from the entire spectrum gradientor manually specifying an exact color with red, green and blue components.Or even a hexadecimal code.Frequently used colors can also be favoritedand reused across applications.So Pro Apps can allow users to easily select something important,like a brand color, in one context, and use it in many.Finally, just like the macOS panel,the color picker supports grabbing colors from anywhere on the screenusing an eyedropper tool.This is especially powerful on iPadOS when running multiple apps.The color can be easily selected anywhere on the screen,matched and then reused.On macOS, the picker uses the standard color picker panel,allowing the same familiar functionality.So, let's take a look at setting up and using the color picker.In this case, we have a ColorPickerViewController propertyon our existing viewController.When the color button is pressed,we go ahead and set the color on the viewControllerto the current color being usedand then present the ColorPickerViewController.If the user finishes selecting a color, we go ahead and set it in the app.If the user canceled selecting a color, we can safely ignore the color.At no point do we have to worry about how the color was selectedor supporting the eyedropper tool.All of that is handled automatically by the color picker.The date picker in iOS and iPadOS is not a new control,but we have made some really big improvementsto the versatility and user experience of it.New in iPadOS and iOS 14,the compact style is available and supported.Just like the macOS version introduced earlier,the compact style in iOS shows the time and dateas fields that can be tapped to bring up a modal selection.This is especially useful when space is limited in the UI,such as in a table view or form with several fields.When selecting from the date side, a modal calendar is displayedallowing for the easy selection of any given day.This also allows for far more rapid selection of distant datesthan the traditional wheel styles allowedand is better optimized for pointer interaction on an iPad.When tapping on the time,the keypad is used for selection of the time.As mentioned earlier, the compact style is supported on macOS Catalinaand later in the iOS 13.4 SDK and newer.This can help make your optimized or unoptimized Catalyst appbetter support showing a date picker on a Mac.When using it, the date picker control is sized similarly to a UILabel.Clicking on components of the datebring up a modal calendar presentation for selecting the date.The date and time can also be set by typing in values to the field.Additionally, if only the time or only the date are requiredfor a given context,the app can limit the picker to just that part of the field.Additionally, iOS 14 introduces the inline style for the date picker.This is particularly useful in circumstances where selecting a dateis the primary function of a UIand the addition of the modal step is simply unnecessary.This can be useful on iPad apps migrating from the wheel stylewhere more screen space is readily available.The presentation itself matches that of the modal onepresented from the compact style,just filling the contents of the control rather than being presented from it.The great part about all three new stylesis that all the API of UIDatePicker remains exactly the same.So the new styles can be easily adopted or even adjusted,depending on the context,with only the layout of the app being affected.So now let's take a look at using these new styles.Here we see creating a date picker and setting the initial datehas not changed at all on iOS 14.We can also set minimum and maximum dates for the selection.All we have to do to use one of the new styles is just set a preferred one.And here we'll set that to the compact style.We can also customize the locale and calendar of the date picker if necessary.And the new styles will show the appropriate content.In this case, we'll show the Japanese calendar.And we can see how the era is now displayed where the year was previously.We can also limit the selection to just the dateif the time isn't relevant to this context.The date picker is still just a UIControl.So it's easy to be notified when the value has changedand then read in the new date.The new date picker styles provide an improved experiencewhen selecting dates in an applicationwithout the application having to handle many of the inherent complexitiesof different calendars or interactions across platforms.Now I'd like to hand it over to my colleague, David Duncan.Thanks, Eric.I'm David Duncan,and I'm going to talk about enhancements to menus and UIAction.Let's start with how iOS 14 brings quick, lightweight interactions with menusto more parts of your UI.Any app in iOS 14 can easily add menus to UIButtons and UIBarButtonItems.This example shows how Safari uses menus to put more power at your fingertips.Let's dive into this interaction.Tapping on the tab switch button performs the default action,showing the Safari tab switcher.On iOS 14, long pressing on this button presents a menu with more options.Immediately, you can slide your finger to select an item and lift to activate.Let's see how to add a menu like this to your app.UIButton and UIBarButtonItem directly support menus,and adding one couldn't be easier.Just assign a menu to the menu property of either class,and UIKit will take care of displaying that menu on long press.But in some cases, you don't want to wait.Let's take a look at that interaction.Reminders uses a More button to group several actions together.Unlike our Safari example, the menu presents immediatelywhen you touch the button.Just like before, the user can then slide their fingerand quickly select an action in one smooth gesture.How you select this interaction differs between UIButton and UIBarButtonItem.For UIButton, setting showsMenuAsPrimaryAction to truecauses the button to present its menu immediately on touch down.For UIBarButtonItem, providing a menu but not setting a primary actionindicates the menu should present on touch down.On iOS 14, you'll also see menus automatically providedby the navigation Bar Back button.This menu creates a standard acceleratorfor jumping back in the nav stack in any application.Menu titles are automatically chosenconsidering customized back buttons where appropriate.If you use a custom title viewbut don't set a title of a navigation item,consider setting backButtonTitle to ensure a good experience.The new menu support you've seen so far is provided by UIControl.You've already seen showsMenuAsPrimaryActionwhich determines if the menu triggers on long press or touch down.UIControl provides access to its contextMenuInteractionand a property to enable that interaction.To support custom menu-based UIs, you can subclass UIControland override its implementation of ContextMenuInteractionDelegate.To take action when the menu gesture has been recognized,you can register for the menuActionTriggered control event.Now let's take a look at powerful new features in menusto complement the new places where you can use them.UIDeferredMenuElement adds the ability to asynchronously provide menu items.As our example shows,UIKit presents a standard loading UIwhile waiting for the final menu items to be provided.Once provided, these items are cached should the menu be displayed again.UIDeferredMenuElement is also useful for generating complex menus,as the items won't be requested until they need to be displayed.Next, let's focus on two new features of UIContextMenuInteraction.UpdateVisibleMenu allows you to update the menu currently presented to the user.You receive a copy of that menu,and you return a menu to present in its place.To make this API super easy to use,UIMenu has changed behavior to no longer force its children to be immutable,allowing you to update and return the menu passed to your blockinstead of creating a new one.UIContextMenuInteraction now provides a query for the interaction's appearance.This property may return rich when displaying a preview,compact for menu-only interactions or none.While controls always use the compact appearance,your own interactions may display rich or compact based on how they're triggered.That's some of the new capabilities in iOS 14 to bring menus to more places.Next, let's see how improvements to UIAction can make it easier than everto act on user input.In iOS 13, UIKit introduced UIAction to make sharing event handling code easier.For a refresher, see "Modernize your UI for iOS 13"from WWDC 2019.iOS 14 expands where and how you can use UIAction in your app.UIBarButtonItem adds new initializers to create items with actions and menus.They make it easy to create BarButtonItemsthat react to taps, present menus or both.And nearly every parameter is optional,so you only need to specify those that you need.Let's take a look.Here we configure the toolbar items of our viewControllerusing new API in iOS 14.First, we create a system item that triggers an action when tappedand a menu when long pressed.Next, we add a fixedSpace, using the new fixedSpacewidth API.Then we add a custom item,configured to display an image and present a menu on touch down.Now, a flexibleSpace, also using new API.And finally, an item that will use the primaryAction's title or imageand trigger the handler on tap.Like BarButtonItems, all controls can be constructed with a UIAction,but two controls,UIButton and UISegmentedControl, have additional behavior.UIButton adds a new initializer accepting the button type alongside a UIAction.The type defaults to system, and the primary action's title and imageare used to configure the button when appropriate.Like other controls created with a primaryAction,that action is registered to handle the primaryActionTriggered control eventcausing the action handler to be called when the button is tapped.Before we look at Segmented Control's support for UIAction,let's see how you might configure one prior to iOS 14.First, create the control with an array of strings.Next, add a handler to call a method, located elsewhere in your code.That method then has to switch over the selected segmentassuming a mapping that may change.And when the mapping does change,the compiler can't help you catch the problem.iOS 14 makes this much easier.With UIAction, creating segmented controls looks like this.Create the control with an array of UIActions,each defining the title or image for one segment.But unlike before, we don't need to add an event handler.UIKit automatically calls the action's handlerwhen that segment is selected and only that segment.No more need for a switch statement.No more default case to try to catch problems.The handler is right there next to control creation.And the compiler can help us keepconfiguration and response to user input in sync.Here we use an enum to generate our actions.Which means we can just add a new enum case,and our segmented control's behavior updates automatically.And you can still combine this with control event handlingfor the best of both worlds.UISegmentedControl's adoption of UIAction starts with a new initializerand adds new methods for adding, removing, updating and finding segments.As we've already seen, segments associated with a UIActionwill have that action's handler called only when that segment is selected.iOS 14 has a lot to offer to enhance your applicationfor iPhones, iPads and Mac Catalyst.Refresh your UI by taking advantage of new appearances on stock controls,new customizability on UIPageControl and new styles for UIDatePicker.Adopt ColorPickerController for all your color picking needs,making it easy for your users to select any color they can see.Make your application easier and faster to use with menus,where a quick slide of the finger can begin any task.Support rapid navigation through your appby making sure back button menus are clear and correct.And take action on UIAction to simplify and share code to handle user input.I can't wait to see how you enhance your applications.And thank you for watching.
