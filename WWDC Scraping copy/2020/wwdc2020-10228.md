What's new in Low-Latency HLSApple has added Low-Latency extensions to the HTTP Live Streaming protocol that combine the quality and scalability of HLS with a stream delay of two seconds or less. Learn about the most recent developments in LL-HLS and how it allows you to make your video delivery competitive with broadcast and improve social media integration.

Search this video…Hello, and welcome to WWDC.My name is Roger Pantos.And today we are gonna talk about some updates to Low-Latency HLS.The first thing I'd like to announce is that Low-Latency HLSis coming out of beta!That means it will be available to everyonein iOS 14, tvOS 14, and this year's macOS.That includes support for bit-rate switching,FairPlay Streaming, fMP4 CMAF, and all your other favorite HLS features.It's available to any native application,and this year there's no entitlement necessary.Also, given that we're finalizing the Low-Latency protocol,the time has come to add them to the HLS spec itself.So, the second revision draft of the HLS RFC on ietf.orgnow includes all of the rules for Low-Latency.And in addition to those rules, it also includes a couple new appendicesfor the Low-Latency Server Configuration Profileand describing the CDN tune-in algorithm.Also, the page that was hosting the provisional Low-Latency specwhile it was in beta is now being turned into an informative articlewith some more descriptions and examples.You can find information about Apple device supportin the HLS authoring spec on developer.apple.com.Now, in the year that Low-Latency HLS has been in beta, we got some great feedback,and, as a result, we made some significant changes to the protocol.One of the areas that we focused onsince the beginning of the original Low-Latency designwas reducing segment delay.That's the time between when a new segment is producedand when the client begins to receive it.The approach that we took initiallywas to have that segment ride along with the Playlist updateusing HTTP/2 Push.But one of the biggest areas of feedback we receivedis that the Push approach doesn't really workfor how a lot of people deliver their content,and, in particular, it's not compatiblewith how a lot of ad-supported content gets delivered.And so we replaced H2 Push with a new approachthat we call "Blocking Preload Hints."The basic idea is that, similar to Blocking Playlist Reload,the client will ask for the next part before it's readyand then the server will hold on to the request until it can send it.If you'd like to know more about Blocking Preload Hints,we've got an entire talk where we go into it in more detail.One of the things that we're really pleased aboutis that Blocking Preload Hints actually perform better than H2 Pushwhen you're using a CDN.And that's because driving the request from the clientalso triggers CDN cache fillwithout requiring an extra round trip between the edge and the origin.And so that's great for CDNs.And it's also good that we're no longer asking them to support Push,although they do still need to support HTTP/2.In addition to moving away from Push, we made some other improvements as well.One of the bits of feedback that we received from the CDN folkswas that allowing a client to ask for specific rendition reportscould lead to a combinatorial explosion of different request URLsthat all reference the same playlist update,and that reduced caching efficiency.So we changed the spec to eliminate the report delivery directive,and, instead, we now put all Rendition Reports into every playlist update.We also heard from providers who are using lots of date-range tagswith long DVR windows.So we added a way for themto incorporate date-range tags into Playlist Delta Updates,so the update only carries the most recent one.And we go into more detail about thatin our separate video about Playlist Delta Updates.Finally, we added gap signaling to Rendition Reports and Partial Segmentsin the form of new attributes on the Part and Rendition Report tags.This allows clients to deal better with encoded outages in Low-Latency streams.Beyond improving the spec,we also updated our server reference implementation.Now if you remember that from last year,we have a set of Low-Latency toolsthat allow you to generate your own Low-Latency stream.Late last year, we added an option to that to package media as fragmented MPEG-4so it's compatible with CMAF.The web server is also much easier to set up.Rather than having to configure your own web serverand then mating a PHP script to it, you can now just run a Go scriptand that will implement the delivery directivesand an HTTP/2 web server in a single package.Finally, we've incorporated the Low-Latency toolsinto the regular HLS tools package.So now, once again, there's a single download for everything.You can find out more about that in Eryk's talkabout improving stream authoring using the HLS tools.So to summarize what's new in Low-Latency HLS,we've made several important improvements,including using Preload Hinting instead of Push,improving the Delivery Directive interface,and providing CMAF support in the server reference implementation.The Low-Latency extensions are now part of the core HLS spec on ietf.org.And with all of this in place,Low-Latency HLS will be available to users later this year.So if your users have been asking you for a lower-latency live stream,now is the time to act, and we will look forward to seeing them.Thank you very much.

Hello, and welcome to WWDC.

My name is Roger Pantos.And today we are gonna talk about some updates to Low-Latency HLS.

The first thing I'd like to announce is that Low-Latency HLSis coming out of beta!That means it will be available to everyonein iOS 14, tvOS 14, and this year's macOS.

That includes support for bit-rate switching,FairPlay Streaming, fMP4 CMAF, and all your other favorite HLS features.

It's available to any native application,and this year there's no entitlement necessary.

Also, given that we're finalizing the Low-Latency protocol,the time has come to add them to the HLS spec itself.So, the second revision draft of the HLS RFC on ietf.orgnow includes all of the rules for Low-Latency.And in addition to those rules, it also includes a couple new appendicesfor the Low-Latency Server Configuration Profileand describing the CDN tune-in algorithm.Also, the page that was hosting the provisional Low-Latency specwhile it was in beta is now being turned into an informative articlewith some more descriptions and examples.
