00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:25.516
>> CAROL TENG: Hello.

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:26.436
And welcome.

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:32.826
Many of you developers out there
pour all of your time, effort,

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:36.166
blood, sweat, and tears
into building some

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.666
of the most amazing,

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.526
entertaining, and
beautiful apps.

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:46.236
The most successful developers,
however, don't just focus

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.476
on building great apps.

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.986
They also recognize
the importance

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.676
of building a great
business around their apps.

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:58.566
And that's what we are here
to talk to you about today.

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:00.966
My name is Carol Teng.

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.736
I will be joined by my
colleague, Shashank Phadke,

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:06.236
and we are from the iAd team.

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:10.496
Today we are here to
introduce you to iAd,

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:13.106
Apple's digital advertising
platform.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:16.356
Whether you are a
large development house

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:21.206
or a small indie developer, iAd
has a wide range of solutions

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:23.286
to help you grow your business.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:29.616
And some of the challenges that
all businesses face are how

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:33.666
to generate revenue and how to
attract and retain customers.

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:37.446
iAd has solutions for both.

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:41.876
To help generate
revenue, integrating iAd

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:43.176
into your app is simple.

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:46.196
And you can do this
with minimal code.

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:49.376
We will show you how,
later in the presentation.

00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:54.186
Acquiring customers,
on the other hand,

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:57.016
can be especially daunting
for an app developer.

00:01:58.086 --> 00:01:59.366
As you heard yesterday,

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.216
there are over 1.5 million
apps in the App Store.

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.236
And an average of 119
apps on a user's device.

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:11.766
That is a lot of competition
vying for users' attention.

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:15.166
So how do you help
your app get noticed?

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:19.666
For this, iAd has solutions

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:23.586
to help you efficiently promote
your app in the iOS ecosystem

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:27.316
to generate awareness for your
apps and acquire customers.

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:33.756
Promoting your app involves
three main concepts.

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:38.196
First, identifying and
segmenting your users

00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:40.976
so you know who the
different audiences are

00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:42.346
that you are trying to reach.

00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:47.876
Engaging those users with
relevant and targeted messaging

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.616
in your app promotion campaigns,

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:52.516
and then measuring
the effectiveness

00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:55.976
of those campaigns, so you
can continuously optimize

00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:57.196
and improve the outcomes.

00:02:57.796 --> 00:03:03.406
We will demonstrate how to
use tools and best practices

00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:06.436
that enable you to
do both: monetize

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:09.966
and promote throughout your
app development lifecycle.

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:11.786
Let's get started.

00:03:12.286 --> 00:03:17.006
Imagine that I'm
an app developer.

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:19.636
I have a few apps
in the App Store.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:24.016
And I'm about to launch my
next great app, LiteRight.

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:29.306
LiteRight is a new camera app
with some super special filters

00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:31.476
that aren't available
anywhere else.

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:36.036
It is going to be a free
app which gives users access

00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:40.406
to a subset of those filters,
and in-app purchases allow users

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:43.176
to gain access to even
more incredible filters.

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:48.036
This is my app development
timeline,

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:50.246
which may look similar
to your own.

00:03:50.726 --> 00:03:54.126
Starting with the design phase,
then I'll be developing the app,

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:57.616
launching it in the App Store,
and growing my user base.

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:02.286
I'm currently in the
design phase of LiteRight,

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:05.046
but I'm already thinking
about the business model

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:08.246
and how I'm going
to monetize my app.

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:12.116
Since LiteRight will be
a free app, I've decided

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:16.156
to make it ad-supported so I
can start generating revenue

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:16.716
right away.

00:04:17.276 --> 00:04:23.156
And I've selected iAd as my
preferred advertising partner

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:28.006
to monetize my app because iAd
takes care of the whole process

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:33.206
of finding great advertisers,
serving the ads, reporting on

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:36.206
and billing for the
ads that run in my app.

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:40.086
And for that, iAd
shares 70 percent

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:42.816
of the revenue generated
directly with me.

00:04:43.376 --> 00:04:46.646
And iAd isn't an
exclusive network.

00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:48.956
So I can work with
other ad networks

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.986
and mediation partners
if I choose.

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:55.486
But because I'm trying to
maximize my revenue and I care

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:58.246
about premium, high quality ads,

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:00.896
I'm going to make
iAd my first call.

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:06.966
Because I've spent a lot of
time building a beautiful app,

00:05:07.446 --> 00:05:09.966
the ads in my app should
be equally beautiful.

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:13.796
To achieve that,
iAd works with some

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:17.886
of the top creative agencies
to deliver rich, immersive,

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.946
high production value
ads from some

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:23.306
of the world's most
recognized brands.

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:28.356
In addition, every ad is
reviewed and certified

00:05:28.616 --> 00:05:32.506
by the iAd team so I can be
sure that the ads appearing

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:35.576
in my app comply with
Apple's creative guidelines.

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:41.936
And I can block any unwanted ads
using key words and iTunes URLs.

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:46.166
And all of this contributes
to a great user experience.

00:05:46.556 --> 00:05:52.556
LiteRight is going to be
a globally available app

00:05:52.556 --> 00:05:56.766
which means my users will
be everywhere and so is iAd,

00:05:57.696 --> 00:06:01.916
with the ability to reach iOS
users in over 100 countries.

00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:08.896
And speaking of my users, iAd's
solution is privacy conscious,

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:11.796
with built-in privacy controls.

00:06:12.646 --> 00:06:15.756
That means my users'
data is highly secure

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:18.196
and is never shared
with third-parties,

00:06:18.736 --> 00:06:20.626
which my users will appreciate.

00:06:21.696 --> 00:06:23.436
It complies with
limit ad tracking,

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:25.866
and is automatically
managed by iAd,

00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:28.966
due to a deep integration
with iOS.

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:36.026
And because iAd is built
into the iOS framework,

00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:40.176
integrating it into my
app is quick and simple.

00:06:40.856 --> 00:06:44.906
There are no additional
SDKs and no static libraries

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:47.326
or third-party headers
to clutter up my project.

00:06:48.126 --> 00:06:50.846
I can be up and running
with minimal code.

00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:54.596
Documentation and
sample code are available

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:55.726
to help me along the way.

00:06:56.276 --> 00:07:01.076
And here are all the ad
formats that iAd offers.

00:07:01.806 --> 00:07:05.526
I can integrate one or more
of these ad formats depending

00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:09.466
on what best complements my
app content and experience.

00:07:10.026 --> 00:07:14.856
A banner, which typically
appears at the bottom

00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:21.256
of the app, a medium rectangle
or M-rec which is good in-line

00:07:21.256 --> 00:07:23.286
for content-heavy apps.

00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:28.286
Pre-roll video that
are best for apps

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:30.006
that primarily deliver video.

00:07:32.316 --> 00:07:35.716
And interstitial, for apps that
have good, logical transitions,

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:38.986
such as in games where
users are leveling up.

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:44.866
And coming soon, iAd will
support interstitial video,

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:48.566
another way to help further
increase monetization

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:53.906
for my app.

00:07:54.176 --> 00:07:55.856
Now let's look at
how we integrate iAd

00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:58.186
into my app, LiteRight.

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.656
For LiteRight, I'm going
to include banner ads

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.186
on the photo gallery screen,

00:08:04.756 --> 00:08:08.096
and an interstitial every third
time a user shares a photo.

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:14.916
For the banner, I need to link
to the iAd framework and import,

00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:17.986
include the iAd library
as part of my project.

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:22.426
Then I'll need to configure
the view controller,

00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:24.986
such that wherever I
want a banner to appear,

00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:27.586
I'll set 'can display
banner ads' to true.

00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:31.806
And a good place to do this is
in the 'view did load' callback.

00:08:32.566 --> 00:08:35.796
iAd will take care
of managing the view

00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:38.506
such that the banner
animates in on screen

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:40.856
and collapses the frame
of my content accordingly.

00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:46.606
And when I'm done, here is
what that might look like.

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:52.756
Unlike banners there's a
little more setup required

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:54.736
to prepare my app
for interstitials.

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:57.556
In my app delegate,

00:08:57.556 --> 00:08:59.616
in the 'application
did finish launching

00:08:59.886 --> 00:09:04.686
with options' callback, I need
to let the iAd server know

00:09:04.686 --> 00:09:05.546
that my app is going

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:09.466
to be requesting an interstitial
via the 'prepare interstitial

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.136
ads' call.

00:09:10.756 --> 00:09:16.496
And in the view controller,
just prior to the interstitial,

00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:18.406
I can configure the presentation

00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:21.216
so that the interstitial
will appear just before the

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:22.036
next screen.

00:09:23.086 --> 00:09:26.686
A good place to do this is in
the 'prepare for segue' method.

00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:31.066
iAd makes this simple.

00:09:31.876 --> 00:09:35.186
All I need to do is set the
interstitial presentation policy

00:09:35.536 --> 00:09:36.296
to automatic.

00:09:36.816 --> 00:09:40.406
And this lets iAd manage the
presentation of interstitial ads

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:41.676
in the view controller.

00:09:42.246 --> 00:09:47.226
And when I'm done I can see
what that will look like.

00:09:48.216 --> 00:09:51.036
I have just shown you
how to integrate a banner

00:09:51.036 --> 00:09:51.996
and interstitial,

00:09:52.346 --> 00:09:55.226
but integrating the other ad
formats is just as simple,

00:09:56.386 --> 00:10:00.466
and iAd has tools to let me test
my integration so I can ensure

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:03.776
that I've implemented everything
correctly before I launch.

00:10:05.536 --> 00:10:07.196
For some of you at this stage,

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:09.746
there may still be more
development work left

00:10:09.746 --> 00:10:10.086
for your app.

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:14.386
But since I've taken the
time to integrate iAd early

00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:17.236
into my development cycle,
I don't have to worry

00:10:17.236 --> 00:10:19.046
about coming back
and doing it later.

00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:22.906
And I can be generating
revenue as soon as I launch.

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:28.746
So now we've launched LiteRight.

00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:31.536
It's live in the App Store.

00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:35.866
Users are downloading
and using the app.

00:10:36.126 --> 00:10:37.546
And ads are running in it based

00:10:37.546 --> 00:10:39.166
on the integrations
I just showed you.

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:42.826
And here are examples of a
banner and an interstitial.

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:49.036
And I can see how much revenue
I'm generating from the ads

00:10:49.036 --> 00:10:51.696
in my app by checking
the reporting portals

00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:55.886
in iTunes Connect, or using
the new publisher reporting API

00:10:56.396 --> 00:10:57.916
that is coming soon.

00:10:59.016 --> 00:11:02.456
Because I've made the investment
to integrate iAd early

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:06.166
on in my dev cycle, it
is already paying off.

00:11:09.056 --> 00:11:11.936
Now let's look at how to
make other smart investments

00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:14.186
that will grow my
app install base.

00:11:14.186 --> 00:11:20.456
So I'm earning the
steady stream of revenue

00:11:20.456 --> 00:11:22.716
by showing ads in my app.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:25.436
And some of you may choose
not to monetize your apps

00:11:25.436 --> 00:11:27.246
in this way, which is okay.

00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:31.546
All of you, however, probably
care about acquiring users

00:11:31.906 --> 00:11:35.206
and driving downloads
and usage of your app.

00:11:36.216 --> 00:11:38.526
And for that you
will need to invest

00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:40.196
in actively promoting your app

00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:43.206
which is what I plan
to do with LiteRight.

00:11:44.296 --> 00:11:47.666
Part of my growth strategy is
to take some of the revenue

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:51.576
that I've earned from showing
ads in my app and reinvest it

00:11:51.576 --> 00:11:54.436
in marketing efforts to
promote LiteRight in order

00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:55.716
to expand my user base.

00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:00.316
As more people discover,
download, and use my app,

00:12:01.286 --> 00:12:04.376
that's more people engaging
with the ads in my app,

00:12:04.376 --> 00:12:07.016
which further increases
monetization.

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:09.906
And this creates a
continuous cycle.

00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:15.606
So I can monetize
or I can promote,

00:12:15.606 --> 00:12:17.966
but experience has shown

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.056
that I'm the most
successful when I do both.

00:12:20.646 --> 00:12:24.716
We just talked about how
to use iAd to monetize.

00:12:26.086 --> 00:12:29.526
Now let's talk about how
to use iAd to promote

00:12:29.526 --> 00:12:31.346
and drive growth for my app.

00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:37.566
My plan to promote
LiteRight is two pronged.

00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:43.786
First, I need to acquire
new users because with more

00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:47.326
than 1.5 million apps in the
App Store I need some way

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:50.206
to make my app stand
out and be discovered.

00:12:50.776 --> 00:12:55.336
For that I'm going to actively
promote LiteRight and generate

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:57.126
that awareness for my app.

00:12:58.176 --> 00:13:00.776
iAd has tools to help
me promote my app

00:13:01.006 --> 00:13:02.856
without any additional code.

00:13:03.686 --> 00:13:05.736
We'll show you how later
in the presentation.

00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:09.106
And what I've learned
from my experience

00:13:09.106 --> 00:13:12.306
with the other apps is
that I can't just focus

00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:13.726
on acquiring new users.

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:19.056
I also need to engage
existing users

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:23.396
who have already downloaded
because one in four apps

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.696
that are downloaded
are never used.

00:13:26.676 --> 00:13:31.026
And only 32 percent of users
who download an app continue

00:13:31.026 --> 00:13:33.266
to use it after a week.

00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:37.296
To effectively reengage
users who have downloaded,

00:13:37.846 --> 00:13:40.516
I need to understand what
kind of users they are

00:13:41.406 --> 00:13:43.356
so I can tailor my
marketing messaging

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:45.236
and target my ad
spend accordingly.

00:13:46.566 --> 00:13:49.716
And for that I'll need
to segment my users based

00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:52.106
on their behavior in my app.

00:13:52.896 --> 00:13:56.076
iAd lets me create several
hundred audience segments,

00:13:57.266 --> 00:14:01.076
but to start I'll group my
users into two custom segments.

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:05.136
Dormant users, people
who have downloaded

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.536
but are no longer active.

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:10.196
For them I plan to
promote a special offer.

00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:14.456
And a starter pack
purchaser segment.

00:14:14.906 --> 00:14:17.496
These are users who have
purchased the filter starter

00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:18.226
pack in my app.

00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:22.626
For them I plan to promote
our platinum filter package.

00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:26.776
To create a custom
audience segment,

00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:30.266
let's look at how we integrate
the audience segmentation code

00:14:30.386 --> 00:14:34.376
into my app as part of
the next update to my app.

00:14:34.376 --> 00:14:37.266
And I'll use the starter pack
purchaser segment as my example.

00:14:37.796 --> 00:14:44.356
First, I'll check to see
if users have purchased one

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:47.746
of my starter filters, which
means I want to add a them

00:14:47.746 --> 00:14:50.776
to the starter pack
purchasers audience segment.

00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:56.126
Then I need to get a
reference to the shared client.

00:14:57.436 --> 00:15:01.226
And next I'll need to tell
iAd which segment to add users

00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:03.806
to by keeping track of the users

00:15:03.806 --> 00:15:06.386
who have purchased my
starter filter pack.

00:15:07.596 --> 00:15:12.356
I can do this by calling the
'add client to segments' method,

00:15:13.036 --> 00:15:14.886
which takes two arguments.

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:20.376
The first is an array of
segment IDs which I got

00:15:20.496 --> 00:15:22.016
from the iAd WorkBench tool.

00:15:23.336 --> 00:15:26.026
If I attempt to send
some random segment IDs,

00:15:26.586 --> 00:15:27.586
those will be ignored.

00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:31.326
So I do have to get
these from iAd WorkBench.

00:15:31.326 --> 00:15:36.736
And we'll show you where
later during the demo.

00:15:36.896 --> 00:15:40.726
Second I'm going to set
'replace existing' to false.

00:15:41.146 --> 00:15:43.176
Since I don't want
these users removed

00:15:43.256 --> 00:15:48.376
from any other existing
segments they may already be in.

00:15:48.606 --> 00:15:50.676
Now that I've done the
appropriate prep work

00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:54.226
to segment my users,
I'm ready to execute

00:15:54.326 --> 00:15:56.136
on my promotion plan
for LiteRight.

00:15:57.296 --> 00:15:59.796
And for that I'll
use iAd WorkBench,

00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:04.536
iAd's self-service
campaign management tool.

00:16:05.116 --> 00:16:10.146
It gives me full control
to create, manage,

00:16:10.216 --> 00:16:12.796
and optimize my app
promotion campaigns

00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:15.456
and gives access
to full reporting.

00:16:19.056 --> 00:16:22.396
Here you can see I've already
created a few campaigns

00:16:22.656 --> 00:16:27.716
to execute on my promotional
plan to acquire new users

00:16:27.866 --> 00:16:29.656
and to re-engage dormant users.

00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:33.036
Next we'll use iAd WorkBench

00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:37.066
to retarget my starter pack
purchaser audience segment

00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:39.536
to promote my platinum
filter package.

00:16:40.336 --> 00:16:43.436
For this campaign we are going
to drive users from the tap

00:16:43.946 --> 00:16:47.476
of an ad directly into
the page in my app

00:16:48.046 --> 00:16:49.716
where they can make
that in-app purchase.

00:16:51.196 --> 00:16:53.566
And I'll hand it over to
Shashank for that demo.

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:59.696
[Applause]

00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:01.006
Thank you.

00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:02.986
>> SHASHANK PHADKE:
Thanks, Carol.

00:17:02.986 --> 00:17:05.136
Good morning, everybody.

00:17:05.136 --> 00:17:07.705
My name is Shashank Phadke,
and I'm with the iAd team.

00:17:09.006 --> 00:17:12.876
Today I'm going to show you two
awesome things in iAd WorkBench.

00:17:13.746 --> 00:17:16.256
First I'm going to show
you where you can view

00:17:16.256 --> 00:17:18.236
and manage your audience
segments.

00:17:19.576 --> 00:17:23.136
And number two, I am going
to show you how easy it is

00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:26.656
to create a retargeting
campaign using one

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:27.746
of those audience segments.

00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:29.456
So let's get started.

00:17:38.856 --> 00:17:42.046
When I log into iAd
WorkBench I see my dashboard.

00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:48.016
This is where you see all your
campaigns across all your apps.

00:17:49.076 --> 00:17:51.446
To view your audience segments,

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:55.676
you go to the 'my audiences'
page using the dropdown

00:17:55.786 --> 00:17:57.516
on the right side of the page.

00:17:58.896 --> 00:18:01.906
Here on the 'my audiences' page,

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:04.786
you see all the audience
segments

00:18:05.186 --> 00:18:08.486
that you have defined
across your apps.

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:12.406
For every audience
segment you create,

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:16.766
iAd WorkBench assigns
you a unique segment ID.

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.586
Like for example,

00:18:19.676 --> 00:18:22.016
for my LiteRight
starter pack purchases,

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:25.576
this is the Segment ID
iAd WorkBench gave me.

00:18:26.796 --> 00:18:31.256
This is the ID you use in
your code to instrument

00:18:31.546 --> 00:18:34.176
and start adding
users to that segment.

00:18:34.226 --> 00:18:38.826
Because of that instrumentation
I can see that there are

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:42.266
about 10,000 plus users already

00:18:42.346 --> 00:18:45.176
in my starter pack
purchases segment.

00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:52.626
Now, of course this number
will keep on updating as more

00:18:52.626 --> 00:18:56.186
and more users download
my starter pack.

00:18:57.576 --> 00:19:01.046
Now let's see how we
can use this segment

00:19:01.576 --> 00:19:07.486
to create a retargeting campaign
for my new platinum filter pack.

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:14.436
To do that, I go back to
the dashboard and click

00:19:14.506 --> 00:19:18.216
on the 'create campaign'
button to start the campaign.

00:19:18.746 --> 00:19:25.386
I get to choose if I want to
promote an app or a product.

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:27.546
In this case I'm
promoting my app.

00:19:27.546 --> 00:19:29.146
So I select "app."

00:19:29.996 --> 00:19:33.556
As you can see, all my
apps are already listed.

00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:36.656
I choose LiteRight
for this campaign.

00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:41.706
Then I get to choose if I want
to promote and run this ad

00:19:41.706 --> 00:19:45.456
on the app network
or on iTunes Radio.

00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:51.266
I choose app network and I also
see that my ad will be running

00:19:51.266 --> 00:19:57.146
in more than 100 countries
where I already support it.

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:59.376
Next I choose my bid type.

00:20:00.906 --> 00:20:04.726
CPC, which is cost
per click, or CPM,

00:20:05.436 --> 00:20:07.456
which is cost per
thousand impressions.

00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:13.446
For this campaign, since I want
to pay only when the user clicks

00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:15.546
on my banner, I will choose CPC.

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:21.256
Let's name this campaign.

00:20:21.986 --> 00:20:25.456
LiteRight platinum campaign.

00:20:28.876 --> 00:20:32.886
Next I see a list of
lines in the campaign.

00:20:33.406 --> 00:20:34.386
I don't have any.

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:37.746
So let me show you what
it takes to create a line.

00:20:38.406 --> 00:20:40.616
Click on the 'create
line' button.

00:20:41.436 --> 00:20:46.906
First I choose which country
I want to run this ad.

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:53.046
I choose U.S. And now for my
platinum filter pack I want

00:20:53.046 --> 00:20:55.936
to specifically target the users

00:20:56.016 --> 00:20:58.456
who have already
downloaded my starter pack.

00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:04.476
In this case I will select my
retargeting option to be 'yes.'

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:12.116
As you can see, all my audience
segments are listed over here.

00:21:12.966 --> 00:21:16.036
This was the same view which we
saw in the 'my audiences' page.

00:21:17.056 --> 00:21:19.976
For this campaign
I want to reach

00:21:19.976 --> 00:21:22.586
out to this 10,000
plus LiteRight starter

00:21:22.586 --> 00:21:23.556
pack purchases.

00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:25.166
So I will select that.

00:21:26.676 --> 00:21:29.266
In addition to the
audience segment,

00:21:29.966 --> 00:21:32.896
I can choose other
targeting dimensions.

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:37.426
Like, for example, if
I want my ad to run

00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:40.276
on specific devices,
iPhone or iPad.

00:21:40.856 --> 00:21:46.756
Or I could choose different
U.S. or user geographies,

00:21:48.186 --> 00:21:51.586
or I can have a dimension
of app channels,

00:21:52.286 --> 00:21:54.626
which is the iTunes
category of the apps,

00:21:54.956 --> 00:21:59.096
I want the ad to run on.

00:21:59.096 --> 00:22:01.886
Or I could schedule my ad
to run on a particular time

00:22:01.886 --> 00:22:05.796
of the day or days of the week.

00:22:05.796 --> 00:22:08.476
After selecting all the
targeting dimensions I can see

00:22:08.476 --> 00:22:12.976
that I can reach up to 10,000
plus users which is more

00:22:12.976 --> 00:22:16.836
than the minimum 6,000 required
for a retargeting campaign.

00:22:17.146 --> 00:22:20.056
So I'm good.

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.866
Next I choose my ad type.

00:22:21.926 --> 00:22:23.636
It is going to be a banner.

00:22:24.506 --> 00:22:26.496
And I'm going to choose
a destination type

00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:27.986
of ad deep link.

00:22:28.936 --> 00:22:31.436
I'll tell you about this
ad deep link destination

00:22:31.506 --> 00:22:32.626
on the next screen.

00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:36.976
I choose my flight
dates, let it be running

00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:38.276
from tomorrow for a month.

00:22:38.906 --> 00:22:42.796
And then for the campaign
I define my budget.

00:22:44.006 --> 00:22:46.576
I would like to spend,
say, $3,000.

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:51.496
And then I put in my CPC bid.

00:22:51.716 --> 00:22:54.016
Say, 50 cents.

00:22:54.276 --> 00:22:56.676
Now, iAd is an auction-based
marketplace.

00:22:57.536 --> 00:23:00.276
So I know for sure I
won't be paying any more

00:23:00.456 --> 00:23:01.586
than the 50 cents.

00:23:02.616 --> 00:23:06.256
In fact, I could be paying less.

00:23:06.256 --> 00:23:13.096
Let's name the line.

00:23:13.296 --> 00:23:19.226
Once I have defined the line on
the next screen, I see a list

00:23:19.226 --> 00:23:22.486
of all the lines I have
defined for this campaign.

00:23:23.206 --> 00:23:24.876
You can define more
lines if you want,

00:23:25.396 --> 00:23:27.726
but for now let's
leave it at one line.

00:23:29.246 --> 00:23:33.706
Click on "next" to
start creating your ad.

00:23:36.096 --> 00:23:39.996
Now, to define an ad you are
going to define your pre-tap

00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:41.706
and post-tap experience.

00:23:42.956 --> 00:23:46.096
For my ad, I want it to be
a banner before tapping;

00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:50.976
I want my ad to run on all
devices, iPhones, iPads,

00:23:51.126 --> 00:23:52.426
so I will choose universal.

00:23:52.956 --> 00:23:55.416
I choose my language.

00:23:56.056 --> 00:24:03.256
And for the creative, I can
use a standard set of templates

00:24:03.256 --> 00:24:07.296
that iAd WorkBench provides
me with various color schemes.

00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:11.606
Or if I want I can upload
images from my desktop.

00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:15.726
For now, let's quickly
use a standard template.

00:24:16.396 --> 00:24:29.636
I can give it a title, a message
for my new platinum pack,

00:24:31.256 --> 00:24:32.826
and a call to action text.

00:24:33.716 --> 00:24:39.866
As you can see, I get to see
the preview of how this is going

00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:42.226
to look on the devices.

00:24:42.556 --> 00:24:45.216
In fact, I can get a preview
of how it is going to look

00:24:45.216 --> 00:24:47.276
across all different devices.

00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:54.806
Now I want to choose what the
post-tap experience I want

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:55.386
for the user.

00:24:56.096 --> 00:24:59.506
I am going to choose
ad deep link.

00:25:00.216 --> 00:25:02.756
Because in this case
for my platinum pack,

00:25:03.346 --> 00:25:07.116
every time the user clicks
on the banner, I want my app

00:25:07.626 --> 00:25:12.156
to open up on the device
and take the user directly

00:25:12.316 --> 00:25:15.436
into the page where
they can do the purchase

00:25:15.436 --> 00:25:19.866
of my platinum filter
pack, in-app purchase.

00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:24.436
In order to configure that, I
need to put in a deep link URL.

00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:32.556
I put in my custom scheme
and for filters, where I want

00:25:32.556 --> 00:25:37.186
to go directly to the page where
I can do an in-app purchase

00:25:37.646 --> 00:25:40.606
of the platinum filter pack.

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.986
Now, most of the time
my app will be installed

00:25:42.986 --> 00:25:44.296
on the device of the user.

00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:47.856
But for some reason if
the app is not installed

00:25:48.286 --> 00:25:52.756
and after the user clicks on the
banner, I can take them directly

00:25:52.756 --> 00:25:56.906
to the iTunes App Store
page to re-download the app.

00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.076
Or if I want to take
them to another website

00:26:00.076 --> 00:26:02.006
of my choosing, I
could do that, too.

00:26:02.806 --> 00:26:10.046
For now I want to take
them to the download page.

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:13.886
I will name the destination.

00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:14.746
LiteRight deep link.

00:26:16.036 --> 00:26:18.956
I associate the line which
I created to this ad.

00:26:20.456 --> 00:26:26.306
And name the ad.

00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:27.816
Click "next."

00:26:32.216 --> 00:26:35.366
On the next screen, you
get to see all the ads

00:26:35.456 --> 00:26:37.116
that you have created
for this campaign.

00:26:37.486 --> 00:26:38.656
We just created this ad.

00:26:39.366 --> 00:26:42.416
Again, you could create
more ads if you want to.

00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:47.016
But for now, let's
keep it at one.

00:26:47.136 --> 00:26:50.516
Click "next" to see the
summary of all the campaign set

00:26:50.516 --> 00:26:51.796
up you have done so far.

00:26:52.776 --> 00:26:54.396
I can see the line I created.

00:26:54.926 --> 00:26:57.726
I can see the ads which I
associated with the line.

00:26:58.506 --> 00:27:02.136
I can also enter my
payment information.

00:27:02.766 --> 00:27:05.216
Since iAd WorkBench, when
I signed up for that,

00:27:05.326 --> 00:27:09.606
already has my credit card,
I'm going to use just that.

00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:10.676
That's it.

00:27:10.676 --> 00:27:17.236
At this point of time, I go
and submit this campaign.

00:27:17.366 --> 00:27:19.026
Once you submit the campaign,

00:27:19.786 --> 00:27:22.636
all the ads that
you have created go

00:27:22.636 --> 00:27:24.296
through a certification process.

00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:27.546
And once they are all approved,

00:27:28.476 --> 00:27:31.186
and your line start
date is reached,

00:27:31.756 --> 00:27:33.226
your campaign will start running

00:27:33.656 --> 00:27:38.736
and your ads will start
serving on the devices.

00:27:38.836 --> 00:27:41.276
Now, let me show you after
you created a campaign,

00:27:41.766 --> 00:27:44.556
how do you monitor the
performance of your campaign?

00:27:46.196 --> 00:27:50.516
I recently ran a similar
campaign which just finished.

00:27:50.516 --> 00:27:55.086
So let me click on the analytics
section of the campaign card

00:27:55.736 --> 00:28:08.866
to go to the analytics, to
the analytics dashboard page.

00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:15.186
Here you can see for the
campaign, various metrics.

00:28:16.296 --> 00:28:18.376
The total spent, the
total impressions,

00:28:18.936 --> 00:28:23.016
the total conversions,
all those things.

00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:27.426
I can also slice and dice
this data by filtering

00:28:27.426 --> 00:28:28.946
by a particular date range.

00:28:29.596 --> 00:28:33.336
Or I can view the data
at the campaign level

00:28:33.716 --> 00:28:37.506
or at the line level,
even at the ad level

00:28:37.506 --> 00:28:38.826
or the device type level.

00:28:39.356 --> 00:28:46.406
In the graph which you see I can
plot a particular metric, like,

00:28:46.406 --> 00:28:51.376
for example, the spend per day
across my campaign time period.

00:28:52.336 --> 00:28:55.666
Or I can also overlay
with other metrics.

00:28:55.966 --> 00:28:59.276
For example, impressions
over time.

00:28:59.996 --> 00:29:03.236
Or taps over time.

00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:07.116
If I prefer to do all the
slicing and dicing offline,

00:29:07.676 --> 00:29:16.656
I can always download this data
using the download icon here.

00:29:16.876 --> 00:29:18.646
All this UI functionality

00:29:19.226 --> 00:29:25.586
and analytics reporting I can
also use the iAd's advertising

00:29:25.586 --> 00:29:27.956
API if I prefer so.

00:29:28.896 --> 00:29:31.616
There are so many other things
you can do with iAd WorkBench,

00:29:32.206 --> 00:29:35.586
but for now I will
hand it back to Carol.

00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:35.946
Carol?

00:29:36.516 --> 00:29:42.736
[Applause]

00:29:43.236 --> 00:29:44.146
>> CAROL TENG: Thanks, Shashank.

00:29:44.146 --> 00:29:46.876
As you can see from that demo

00:29:46.876 --> 00:29:50.656
of iAd WorkBench I have
full control to set up

00:29:50.656 --> 00:29:52.606
and run campaigns
to promote my app

00:29:53.676 --> 00:29:56.506
and in the reporting screens I
can see how well my campaigns

00:29:56.506 --> 00:29:56.996
are doing.

00:29:58.346 --> 00:30:01.036
Not only can I do this
inside of iAd WorkBench,

00:30:01.726 --> 00:30:04.836
but I can also use
iAd's attribution API

00:30:05.616 --> 00:30:08.326
to measure the effectiveness
and track app downloads

00:30:08.376 --> 00:30:10.426
that originated from
iAd campaigns.

00:30:11.136 --> 00:30:15.676
It is a method of the AD
client class called 'look

00:30:15.676 --> 00:30:19.106
up ad conversion details,'
which returns two dates.

00:30:19.676 --> 00:30:24.426
The first is the app download
date, which is the date

00:30:24.536 --> 00:30:26.586
that the user downloaded
the app.

00:30:28.436 --> 00:30:30.546
The second is the
last click date,

00:30:30.546 --> 00:30:33.566
and this would be the last
date that the user clicked

00:30:33.566 --> 00:30:37.726
on the ad prior to the
purchase of the app.

00:30:37.986 --> 00:30:40.576
If both of these dates
are there and true,

00:30:40.576 --> 00:30:44.686
that means this app download
is directly attributable

00:30:44.746 --> 00:30:47.956
to the user interacting
with and clicking on an iAd

00:30:48.356 --> 00:30:50.286
that is promoting my app.

00:30:52.836 --> 00:30:53.896
So that's it.

00:30:54.676 --> 00:30:57.886
Over this imaginary
journey of developing

00:30:57.886 --> 00:31:01.176
and launching the LiteRight
app, I hope you've seen how

00:31:01.176 --> 00:31:03.606
to apply the best
practices of some

00:31:03.606 --> 00:31:05.746
of the most successful
app developers.

00:31:06.326 --> 00:31:11.476
Even as early as the design
phase, they are already thinking

00:31:11.476 --> 00:31:13.786
about the business model
and how they are going

00:31:13.786 --> 00:31:15.866
to monetize their app.

00:31:16.896 --> 00:31:20.786
And with just a few lines of
code, you saw how easy it was

00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:22.776
to integrate iAd into your app

00:31:23.746 --> 00:31:27.316
and start generating revenue
even as early as launch.

00:31:27.846 --> 00:31:33.236
Then we talked about the best
practices for growing your app

00:31:33.526 --> 00:31:36.496
by investing wisely to
promote to your users,

00:31:37.436 --> 00:31:41.196
how to instrument your app to
identify and segment your users

00:31:41.786 --> 00:31:44.556
so you can better understand
the various audiences

00:31:44.556 --> 00:31:45.696
that you are trying to address.

00:31:46.296 --> 00:31:50.226
How to target them
with relevant messaging

00:31:50.226 --> 00:31:52.326
and engaging ad experiences,

00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:56.616
so your campaigns will be
more effective and efficient

00:31:56.826 --> 00:31:59.246
at driving downloads
and in-app purchases.

00:31:59.756 --> 00:32:02.826
And how to continuously monitor

00:32:02.826 --> 00:32:06.156
and measure campaign
effectiveness using iAd

00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:08.546
WorkBench and the
attribution API.

00:32:11.916 --> 00:32:15.536
These are all the reasons
that iAd is a great toolset

00:32:15.536 --> 00:32:17.116
for every app developer.

00:32:17.796 --> 00:32:20.936
It is easy to leverage
iAd wherever you are

00:32:20.936 --> 00:32:24.746
in your app development process
to impact the future success

00:32:24.836 --> 00:32:27.166
of your app and just
as important,

00:32:27.536 --> 00:32:29.526
the future success
of your business.

00:32:30.106 --> 00:32:32.566
And one more thing.

00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:36.846
For those of you who are
publishers of content

00:32:37.146 --> 00:32:39.486
for the new news app that
was announced yesterday,

00:32:39.486 --> 00:32:44.786
you will be able to monetize and
promote your content using iAd.

00:32:46.136 --> 00:32:47.756
Go to the news publisher page

00:32:47.976 --> 00:32:50.786
on the Apple developer
site for more information.

00:32:51.626 --> 00:32:54.966
And for more information
about iAd, you can refer

00:32:54.966 --> 00:32:58.206
to the iAd Developer Guide
and iAd Developer Forums,

00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:01.786
or contact our Technology
Evangelist Team.

00:33:03.376 --> 00:33:06.446
There's also a related iTunes
Connect session tomorrow.

00:33:07.516 --> 00:33:08.956
Thank you, and enjoy the
rest of the conference.

00:33:09.516 --> 00:33:12.500
[Applause]
