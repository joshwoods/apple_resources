00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:21.426
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: Thank you.

00:00:21.926 --> 00:00:22.266
Thank you.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.566
My name is Trystan Kosmynka.

00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:27.826
I'm in iTunes Engineering.

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.416
Myself and my colleague David
Hopkins are excited today

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.596
to help you get the most
out of App Analytics.

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:39.296
App Analytics today is publicly
available for all developers

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:40.726
with a valid developer account.

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:44.356
Sales admin or finance
role inside iTunes Connect.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:47.326
There are no restrictions to
your use of App Analytics.

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:49.096
It's available to
all developers.

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:51.716
Because there are
no restrictions

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:55.266
and it's publicly available, we
are excited to tell you that as

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.356
of today it is no
longer in beta.

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.121
[Applause]

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:04.025
Thanks. So why does this matter?

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:05.566
Why do we care about
App Analytics?

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.996
Why is Apple excited to
bring this product to you?

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:11.276
We care because App
Analytics provides answers.

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:13.446
There are a lot of big
questions that you have

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:14.856
as app developers or marketers.

00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:17.026
Are customers finding your app?

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:18.676
Are they installing the app?

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:21.536
Are they purchasing goods
inside of your application,

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:22.266
and are they returning?

00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:25.166
Our goal with App Analytics
is that we can provide some

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.766
of these insights so you
can make great decisions

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:28.426
going forward.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.466
Through these answers, we also
reveal missed opportunities.

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:37.716
A good example of this is if
your application is available

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:40.696
across all storefronts but
you have not yet localized

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:41.686
in a particular country,

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:44.466
with App Analytics what
you can see is you can see

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:46.826
that you have really
high App Store page views

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:50.046
in a particular country but the
conversion rate isn't so good.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:53.246
If you maybe localize your
store presence to that language,

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:55.516
you make it more
accessible to more customers.

00:01:55.766 --> 00:02:00.796
This is the type of data that
we deliver with App Analytics.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.006
With all of these,
our ultimate goal is

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.126
to help you build a better app.

00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:07.776
You are here to learn tips
and tricks from experts

00:02:08.626 --> 00:02:10.286
so you can build a better app.

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:11.516
That's on the development cycle.

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.886
We want you to know that your
responsibilities do not stop

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:16.296
after launch.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.416
There is a whole new set
of things to focus on,

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.606
marketing your app, advertising
your app, adding more content,

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:26.026
new versions, maybe
there's price changes.

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:28.286
Your Store presence
is important as well.

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:31.476
All of that goes back into your
product development life cycle,

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:35.356
and it's really important
to creating a successful app

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:38.036
in a successful app business.

00:02:38.156 --> 00:02:41.006
We do all of these things
with Analytics data.

00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:43.626
Analytics has three
key data sources.

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:49.606
We have App Store data,
sales data, and usage data.

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:54.306
These three data sources are
combined to tell a single story

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:56.046
across acquisition
to engagement.

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:57.976
We answer those key
questions with this.

00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:00.886
Are customers finding your
app, are they purchasing it,

00:03:00.886 --> 00:03:01.966
and are they using
it and returning?

00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:04.346
To understand these
measures better,

00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:06.536
let's take Trip Guider 2.0.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:09.056
We updated this this
year for WWDC.

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:11.366
Don't download it.

00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:12.866
It is not real.

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:15.016
Here we are seeing
our App Store views.

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:19.806
What App Store views are is a
potential customer visits your

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:21.286
product page in the App Store.

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:22.806
That triggers an App Store view.

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:24.366
This is an example
of our Store measure.

00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:28.496
Next ,we have app
units and app sales.

00:03:28.996 --> 00:03:32.106
This is an example of
our sales measures.

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:34.926
In this example, I have
$2.99 for Trip Guider.

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:36.966
That's going to generate
$2.99 of sales.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.046
This is what the customer
spent on your app.

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:43.156
App units registers
the transaction,

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:46.506
a single app unit would
be present in this case.

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:49.216
Let's move along to
the usage measures.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.196
We have installations.

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:54.126
Installations is
different than app units.

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:55.286
This is a common
question we get:

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:56.596
What is the difference
between these two?

00:03:57.176 --> 00:04:00.496
If I was to purchase Trip Guider
for $2.99, that's one app unit,

00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:02.596
but it may generate
multiple installs.

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:03.196
It's one to many.

00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:05.276
I could have purchased
it and installed it

00:04:05.276 --> 00:04:06.526
on my iPhone and my iPad.

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.686
That generates two
installations.

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:13.356
Additional usage measures that
we have available: sessions,

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:16.916
active devices, and active
devices in the last 30 days.

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:20.435
What is important with these is
that it is again one to many.

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:22.316
I may have opened
this app, Trip Guider,

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:24.646
and visited Pigeon
Point in the morning.

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:25.516
That's one session.

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:27.736
I came home and shared
the experience

00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:28.606
with family and friends.

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:29.866
That's two sessions.

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:31.296
But all of this was
from my iPhone,

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:32.826
and that's one active device.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.416
So sessions is an overall
idea of engagement,

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:38.466
and active devices is, how
large is your device base?

00:04:38.906 --> 00:04:42.096
Active devices in the
last 30 days is the same

00:04:42.096 --> 00:04:45.556
as active devices; however,
the time period is longer.

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:47.636
I'm not using Trip
Guider every single day.

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.486
But if I used it in the
last 30 days, I register a 1

00:04:50.486 --> 00:04:52.856
in the active in last 30 days.

00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:55.366
The last measure
we're going to share

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:57.346
with you is in-app purchases.

00:04:57.636 --> 00:05:00.446
This is again a Store
or sales measure.

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:02.386
In-app purchases is like units

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:04.566
where it's the transaction
itself, not the price.

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:08.926
In this case I bought Northern
California maps for 99 cents.

00:05:09.286 --> 00:05:11.386
What this will do is
it will take 99 cents

00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:12.746
and adds it to the app sales.

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:15.716
So it's app sales and
in-app purchases combined,

00:05:16.076 --> 00:05:18.516
but it will generate a1 for
the in-app purchase measure.

00:05:19.056 --> 00:05:21.596
Combining all these measures,
we get to tell that story

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.816
of acquisition to engagement.

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:24.176
App Store views all the way

00:05:24.176 --> 00:05:26.426
down to in-app purchases
gives you the idea

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.046
of the entire customer
life cycle.

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:29.566
That's great.

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:32.086
But how do you actually
get started?

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:33.216
We have good news.

00:05:33.216 --> 00:05:35.796
This is probably the
easiest session in terms

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:38.036
of work generated for
you, the developer.

00:05:38.486 --> 00:05:40.546
There is nothing you need
to do to get started.

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:42.446
No code you need to write.

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:46.006
There is no SDK that
you need to integrate,

00:05:46.306 --> 00:05:48.106
no iOS framework
you need to hook in.

00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:51.006
This is something completely
built into the operating system

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:52.536
and that you get for free.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:55.206
You have to have a
valid developer license.

00:05:55.306 --> 00:05:56.816
Sales admin or finance role.

00:05:57.616 --> 00:05:59.696
Not a lot involved to
get going with this.

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:03.116
It is available for the
App Store, iOS apps only.

00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:05.856
And it's available
for iOS 8 and above.

00:06:05.856 --> 00:06:07.576
That means that data
is available

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:10.516
when it is generated
from apps on iOS 8.

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.746
Another important point is
that privacy is built in.

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:18.156
With App Analytics, we
wanted to provide developers

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:21.296
with a powerful functionality,
powerful feature and tool,

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:23.036
and we wanted to do so in a way

00:06:23.036 --> 00:06:25.616
that we would not
compromise customer privacy.

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:29.176
This is built all the way from
the operating system to the UI.

00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:32.336
iOS has privacy constraints
built in.

00:06:32.636 --> 00:06:36.086
This means that our usage
measures, customers are prompted

00:06:36.086 --> 00:06:37.696
with this display
where they can choose

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:40.206
to share sessions
and active devices.

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:42.676
We believe that customers
should have a choice,

00:06:43.026 --> 00:06:44.756
and this is built
into App Analytics.

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:46.576
Data is available
in aggregate form

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:49.366
and not personally identifiable,
it's completely anonymous.

00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:51.456
What this means for
you as the developers,

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:54.156
in the App Analytics
UI you see counts.

00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:55.676
You do not see the raw data.

00:06:56.236 --> 00:06:59.036
It is all available
in iTunes Connect.

00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:00.976
It's available today,
it's no longer in beta.

00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:03.646
Once you log into
iTunes Connect,

00:07:03.646 --> 00:07:06.026
you'll see the App
Analytics module show up here.

00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:08.496
That's it for the
static part of this.

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:10.116
I'll turn it over
to David Hopkins,

00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:13.576
and he'll show you an
overview of some key features

00:07:13.576 --> 00:07:15.386
within App Analytics
in an actual demo.

00:07:17.516 --> 00:07:25.416
[Applause]

00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:28.696
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Hi, I'm
David Hopkins, and I'm going

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:40.546
to give you a quick demo of
the App Analytics product.

00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:42.116
When you log into
iTunes Connect,

00:07:42.116 --> 00:07:44.666
you'll see App Analytics
alongside your other modules,

00:07:44.746 --> 00:07:46.866
such as Sales and Trends
and Users and Roles.

00:07:47.506 --> 00:07:50.246
When you click on App Analytics,

00:07:50.246 --> 00:07:51.896
you will be taken
to the app list.

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:55.466
That's the entry point to
the App Analytics product.

00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:58.856
From here you can see a
snapshot across all of your apps

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:01.826
across four key measures,
again measuring all the way

00:08:01.826 --> 00:08:04.006
from acquisition
with App Store views

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:06.216
down to engagement
with sessions.

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:09.836
You'll see the value for
the current period as well

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:11.936
as a percentage change
from the previous period

00:08:11.936 --> 00:08:14.486
to help provide some
context as to whether

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:15.556
that value is good or bad.

00:08:16.806 --> 00:08:19.766
If you hover over the percentage
change, you'll see the value

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.806
for this period and the value
for the previous period as well

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:25.046
as the date ranges
associated with each.

00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:28.946
The default time period
here is the last 30 days,

00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:30.956
but you can change which
time period you're looking

00:08:30.956 --> 00:08:32.765
at from the date
picker in the top right.

00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:35.706
You can select from
any predefined ranges

00:08:36.436 --> 00:08:38.736
or select a custom range as well

00:08:38.736 --> 00:08:41.405
as selecting any
day, week, or month.

00:08:42.076 --> 00:08:44.396
Now I'm showing you the app list

00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:45.596
where you can view
all of your apps.

00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:46.986
Let's dive into one of the apps.

00:08:47.456 --> 00:08:50.146
For those of you who build lots
of great apps, the easiest way

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:51.916
to find your app in
here is to search.

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:54.686
We can search for
our app Trip Guider.

00:08:55.436 --> 00:08:58.206
When we click on the app
Trip Guider, we will be taken

00:08:58.206 --> 00:08:59.686
to the app overview page.

00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:02.506
The app overview
page is designed

00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:05.136
to give you a high-level
overview of your app.

00:09:05.706 --> 00:09:08.536
The first thing you are going
to see is your all time data

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:11.046
for your app since it has
been in App Analytics.

00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:14.186
Again we are seeing across
the same four measures we saw

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:15.976
in the app list with
App Store views,

00:09:16.316 --> 00:09:18.826
app units, sales, and sessions.

00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:22.786
Now is a good time to call
out that Trystan mentioned

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:24.456
that we take privacy
very seriously.

00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:28.536
All of our usage data is
available only for the customers

00:09:28.536 --> 00:09:29.986
who have agreed to opt in

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.726
and share their data
with developers.

00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:33.586
You'll see this text
that says "opt

00:09:33.586 --> 00:09:35.666
in only" below these
usage measures.

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:39.866
If you want to know your opt-in
rate specific to your app,

00:09:39.866 --> 00:09:42.626
click on the question mark next
to About App Analytics Data.

00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:45.816
We click on that, and we can
see for our app Trip Guider

00:09:45.816 --> 00:09:49.396
that in the last 30
days, 23 percent of users

00:09:49.396 --> 00:09:52.046
that installed Trip Guider
agreed to share their data.

00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:55.076
As you move down the page,

00:09:55.126 --> 00:09:57.046
the next thing you'll
see is a breakdown

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.216
by day across six measures.

00:09:59.526 --> 00:10:01.596
Again, we are looking at
the last 30 days here.

00:10:02.386 --> 00:10:05.096
You can see the value for
the current period as well

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:07.626
as the percentage change
from the previous period,

00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:09.796
but now we have a little
bit more granularity.

00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:11.376
We can see the graphs by day.

00:10:11.876 --> 00:10:15.836
So for example, we knew that our
app Trip Guider 2.0 is killing

00:10:15.836 --> 00:10:17.446
it in terms of App Store views.

00:10:17.446 --> 00:10:18.626
We are up 82 percent.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.556
But what we didn't know
is that the majority

00:10:21.556 --> 00:10:24.306
of this increase came over this
five- or six-day period here.

00:10:24.846 --> 00:10:26.956
We can also hover
over any day to find

00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:28.456
out the value for that day.

00:10:28.786 --> 00:10:31.666
We can see that on May 15
we had our peak in terms

00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:36.856
of App Store views, when we had
around 160,000 App Store views.

00:10:37.476 --> 00:10:41.696
As you move down the page, the
next thing you'll see is a map.

00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:45.726
This is a map of your
app units by storefront.

00:10:45.856 --> 00:10:48.716
Here we are looking at which
territories have the most

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:49.336
app units.

00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:53.286
For Trip Guider, you can see
that most of the app units came

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.676
in the United States,
followed by Thailand.

00:10:55.946 --> 00:10:58.506
Again, here we are revealing
missed opportunities.

00:10:58.786 --> 00:11:01.956
Maybe we didn't know that our
app was so popular in Thailand,

00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:04.656
and there's an opportunity for
us to go in and localize our app

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:07.186
to Thai to really
optimize the experience

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:08.496
for the customers in Thailand.

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:11.456
You can change which
measure you're looking at,

00:11:11.496 --> 00:11:14.396
so this default's app units, but
you can select any other measure

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:15.256
that Trystan mentioned.

00:11:15.596 --> 00:11:18.426
Choose sales, and
now we have a map

00:11:18.806 --> 00:11:20.876
of our top sales by territory.

00:11:21.406 --> 00:11:25.066
As you move down the page,
the next thing you'll see is

00:11:25.066 --> 00:11:26.216
on the left-hand side.

00:11:26.406 --> 00:11:28.616
You'll see a graph of
your users' retention.

00:11:29.006 --> 00:11:32.626
Retention is designed to show
you whether your newly acquired

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:35.896
customers are staying
engaged with your app.

00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:38.646
On the right-hand side,
you'll see a breakdown

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:40.786
of your app units by platform.

00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:43.546
Again, you can change which
measure you are looking at here

00:11:43.546 --> 00:11:45.506
to select from any
of these measures.

00:11:46.186 --> 00:11:49.266
You can see that for our app
Trip Guider we have 68 percent

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:51.396
of our app units
coming on the iPhone,

00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:54.066
followed by 29 percent
on the iPad.

00:11:55.636 --> 00:11:57.856
Now I'm showing you the app
list where you can see your list

00:11:57.856 --> 00:11:59.896
of apps as well as
the app overview,

00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:02.316
where you can see a
high-level view of your app.

00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:04.786
I'm going to hand it back over
to Trystan, who will walk you

00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:06.926
through how we can dive
into some of this data.

00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:10.241
[Applause]

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:11.496
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA:
Thank you, David.

00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:14.906
Gave a quick overview
of App Analytics.

00:12:14.906 --> 00:12:15.736
We had the app list.

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:18.006
This is the best way to see all
of your apps at a single view.

00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:21.316
And the app overview, the best
way to look at a single app,

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:23.646
you can see all of the
key measures in one place.

00:12:23.646 --> 00:12:25.796
We have the beautiful
map, the beautiful chart,

00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:27.326
and you can see it
broken down by platform.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.056
That's just touching
the surface.

00:12:29.056 --> 00:12:33.106
As a developer or marketer,
you want to see and explore

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:34.806
and discover new trends.

00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:38.006
And you can do this with
a feature called Metrics.

00:12:38.386 --> 00:12:41.216
What Metrics does, we
take those key indicators,

00:12:41.216 --> 00:12:42.696
all of the measures
we talked about,

00:12:42.776 --> 00:12:45.076
and we add in another
layer called dimensions.

00:12:45.626 --> 00:12:47.736
These dimensions can
be used multiple ways.

00:12:47.836 --> 00:12:48.856
First, as filters.

00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:50.376
If you wanted to
answer the question:

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:54.666
How many sessions am I getting
on my iPhones or my iPads?

00:12:54.906 --> 00:12:57.636
I can do that by filtering
sessions by platform.

00:12:58.386 --> 00:13:01.216
What if you wanted to see
users, are they coming back?

00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:02.726
You can filter by purchase date.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.036
Is my app version being adopted?

00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:08.306
You can do this by filtering
by app version as well.

00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:10.236
Dimensions are a great way

00:13:10.236 --> 00:13:13.276
to see certain measures
filtered by certain things.

00:13:13.676 --> 00:13:15.116
You also can group the data.

00:13:15.116 --> 00:13:17.926
If you wanted to see the
composition of your units

00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:20.856
by a particular platform, you
can view by that data as well.

00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:22.706
We will show these things.

00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:24.776
So we have the measures.

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:25.516
We have the dimensions.

00:13:25.516 --> 00:13:28.726
You can tell interesting stories
by combining these two things.

00:13:28.896 --> 00:13:32.406
We are excited that as of today
there are new measures available

00:13:32.406 --> 00:13:32.816
as well.

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:34.186
You can tell all-new stories.

00:13:34.986 --> 00:13:37.196
The first one we are
introducing is Crashes.

00:13:37.496 --> 00:13:38.466
This is a crash rate.

00:13:39.516 --> 00:13:41.866
This will show up just
like sessions and installs.

00:13:41.866 --> 00:13:42.816
It's a usage measure.

00:13:42.816 --> 00:13:45.686
What it will allow you to do
is you can improve the overall

00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:46.556
stability of your app.

00:13:46.956 --> 00:13:49.396
If you've really focused on
quality on the next version

00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:51.366
of your app, once the
app is in the Store,

00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:54.816
you can filter crashes by
2.0 of your app and see

00:13:54.816 --> 00:13:56.826
if you made the impact
you intended to make.

00:13:58.206 --> 00:13:59.676
Next, we have a new
sales measure.

00:13:59.766 --> 00:14:00.846
This is Paying Users.

00:14:01.526 --> 00:14:04.136
If we look at sales,
sales is a number

00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:05.946
that hopefully is
increasing over time.

00:14:06.306 --> 00:14:08.296
But if you have users that
are purchasing multiple times

00:14:08.296 --> 00:14:10.686
within the app, Paying Users
can give you that visibility.

00:14:10.986 --> 00:14:13.816
It is the unique count of
how many users have purchased

00:14:13.876 --> 00:14:16.766
within your app on a
given day, week, or month.

00:14:16.766 --> 00:14:17.656
It's really powerful.

00:14:18.196 --> 00:14:23.866
Now, on the topic of power,
we have all of our measures.

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:25.916
We have the two new measures
we are excited about.

00:14:26.306 --> 00:14:28.246
There's also power
in comparing things.

00:14:28.426 --> 00:14:31.186
I'll give you some practical
examples before David demos

00:14:31.186 --> 00:14:33.596
of things you should
be commonly comparing

00:14:33.866 --> 00:14:34.936
as you are marketing your app,

00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:36.566
as you are making
product decisions as well.

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.466
The first is product
page conversion rate.

00:14:39.676 --> 00:14:41.386
This is the overall
effectiveness

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:42.306
of your product page.

00:14:43.006 --> 00:14:45.716
It is important to focus
on quality screenshots,

00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:49.766
using app video previews, making
sure your text sounds great.

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:53.186
You do this by comparing app
units in App Store views.

00:14:53.186 --> 00:14:55.506
It will give you an
overall score, so to speak,

00:14:55.656 --> 00:14:56.846
of how that page is doing.

00:14:56.846 --> 00:14:58.586
And you can compare this
across all of your apps.

00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:01.316
Next is average revenue
per paying user.

00:15:01.686 --> 00:15:04.946
We take that new measure, Paying
Users, and compare it to sales.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:07.206
This gives me an
apples-to-apples comparison

00:15:07.436 --> 00:15:08.586
across all my apps.

00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:12.446
Are my users in app A spending
more than my users in app B?

00:15:12.486 --> 00:15:15.006
This is a really important
metric that you can use

00:15:15.006 --> 00:15:16.346
to grow your overall sales

00:15:16.346 --> 00:15:18.466
and grow the overall
health of your app.

00:15:19.236 --> 00:15:20.846
Next, crashes per session.

00:15:21.316 --> 00:15:23.766
Again, Crashes is a
measure you want to use

00:15:23.766 --> 00:15:25.166
to improve the stability
of your app.

00:15:25.546 --> 00:15:27.876
You can use crashes per
session as a comparison

00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:30.686
to see how you are doing
against your other apps.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:35.336
The last example we'll share
is sessions per active device.

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:36.926
This is taking the
Sessions metric

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:38.166
and Active Devices metric,

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:40.716
and by using these
two I get a comparison

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:41.756
across all of my apps.

00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:43.946
I will turn it over to
David, and he's going

00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:45.526
to demo the power
of the metrics view.

00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:48.096
And again, these new measures,
Paying Users and Crashes,

00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:51.266
this is data that you do
not integrate to SDK for,

00:15:51.266 --> 00:15:52.996
and it's data that
only Apple can provide.

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:55.536
Paying Users comes straight
from the sales data.

00:15:55.796 --> 00:15:57.936
It is something that is
unique to App Analytics.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.676
>> DAVID HOPKINS:
Thanks, Trystan.

00:16:03.026 --> 00:16:05.536
So when we left off, we were
looking at the app overview.

00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:08.256
As Trystan mentioned, if you
want to dive into your data,

00:16:08.346 --> 00:16:10.286
the best place to do it
is in the metrics view.

00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:14.516
The metrics view is a tab
within the context of your app.

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:16.976
We can click that, and it will
take us to the metrics view.

00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:20.236
You can click on any of
the data in the overview,

00:16:20.236 --> 00:16:23.196
and it will take you to the
metrics view that data selected.

00:16:23.726 --> 00:16:26.336
For example, we are looking

00:16:26.336 --> 00:16:28.496
at our app units
broken down by platform.

00:16:28.496 --> 00:16:30.386
Say we wanted to
take a deeper look

00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:32.986
at our iPhone users
and our app units.

00:16:32.986 --> 00:16:36.576
We can click on that, and now
we are taken to the metrics view

00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:38.966
with our app units
selected, and we're looking

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:40.696
at just our users on the iPhone.

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:42.826
What you'll see in
the metrics view is

00:16:42.826 --> 00:16:46.086
in the top left you'll see the
value for the period as well

00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:49.766
as a chart where we break
down your app units by day.

00:16:50.346 --> 00:16:53.186
If you hover over a day, you'll
see the value for that day.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.006
If you scroll below the
chart, you'll see a table

00:16:57.006 --> 00:16:58.986
that contains the
value for each day.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.696
And if you scroll to the top,
the next thing we will talk

00:17:03.696 --> 00:17:04.786
about are your measures.

00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:07.076
On the left-hand
side you can see

00:17:07.076 --> 00:17:09.056
that we have app units selected.

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:12.766
Your measures are broken
down by sales and usage.

00:17:13.586 --> 00:17:15.836
If you have any questions
about any of these measures

00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:18.026
at any time, you can
hover over the measure

00:17:18.026 --> 00:17:19.435
and you'll see a question mark.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.715
If you click on that
question mark,

00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:23.165
you'll get the definition
of the measure.

00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:25.726
So we talked about this
new measure, Paying Users.

00:17:25.726 --> 00:17:29.796
You can see it says the number
of unique users that paid

00:17:30.056 --> 00:17:33.056
for the app or an
in-app purchase.

00:17:33.206 --> 00:17:34.816
Great. I talked about
how we are looking

00:17:34.816 --> 00:17:36.776
at just our app units
on the iPhone.

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:39.516
To do this, we have
a concept of filters.

00:17:39.956 --> 00:17:43.346
To add a filter, click
on the top right,

00:17:43.346 --> 00:17:44.986
and you can add up
to two filters.

00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:46.396
Right now you can see
that we are looking

00:17:46.396 --> 00:17:47.986
at just our users on the iPhone.

00:17:48.446 --> 00:17:50.146
We can click to add
a second filter.

00:17:50.146 --> 00:17:54.096
So let's look at our users on
the iPhone in the United States.

00:17:54.746 --> 00:17:58.846
And now we are looking
at just those users

00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:00.606
on the iPhone in
the United States.

00:18:00.936 --> 00:18:03.946
You can also change which
version you're looking at.

00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:05.616
If you want to switch
between platforms,

00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:11.636
select from iPhone
and switch to iPad.

00:18:11.776 --> 00:18:15.226
Great. Now I've shown you how
to look at a specific value

00:18:15.226 --> 00:18:16.666
within any given dimension.

00:18:17.026 --> 00:18:20.026
Oftentimes, you want to
instead compare the values

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:21.016
within a given dimension.

00:18:21.516 --> 00:18:23.866
To do this, we have a
feature called View By.

00:18:24.316 --> 00:18:28.776
If we remove our filters, and
let's say we want to look at all

00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:31.536
of our top territories
for our app units and see

00:18:31.536 --> 00:18:32.686
which ones rank the highest.

00:18:33.076 --> 00:18:36.326
We can select View By,
and select territory,

00:18:36.326 --> 00:18:40.176
and now you'll see all of
your top territories plotted

00:18:40.176 --> 00:18:41.746
over time for app units.

00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:45.436
Again, if you hover over
the graph on any given day,

00:18:45.436 --> 00:18:47.916
you can see the value for
each of your top territories.

00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:51.656
If you scroll down below the
chart, you'll see a table

00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:54.456
that contains the total
value for each territory.

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:58.176
And you can see here that we
have five territories selected

00:18:58.176 --> 00:18:58.806
by default.

00:18:58.806 --> 00:18:59.976
These are the top territories.

00:19:00.026 --> 00:19:02.586
But you can also
deselect any of these.

00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:05.296
We can deselect Brazil
and then plot Japan.

00:19:05.736 --> 00:19:07.506
Now the graph will update.

00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:11.276
The default view here
is as a line chart,

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:14.646
but you can also change this to
an area chart or a bar chart.

00:19:14.716 --> 00:19:15.766
We can switch to area.

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:19.656
That gives us a nice view
of the overall curve as well

00:19:19.656 --> 00:19:21.256
as a breakdown for
each dimension.

00:19:21.816 --> 00:19:25.086
Okay. So now I've shown you
how to compare the values

00:19:25.086 --> 00:19:26.296
within a given dimension.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.466
But sometimes you're
more interested

00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:30.696
in the relationship
between two measures.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:34.026
One example of this that Trystan
talked about is the relationship

00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:36.246
between app units
and App Store views.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.476
You'll call this your
product page conversion rate.

00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:42.606
What percentage of users are
landing on your App Store page

00:19:42.606 --> 00:19:44.086
and going on to purchase
your app?

00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:46.916
To do this, we have a
feature called Compare To.

00:19:47.596 --> 00:19:49.416
From here, we're
looking at app units,

00:19:49.416 --> 00:19:50.896
and we can select
another measure.

00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:52.926
So we'll select App Store views.

00:19:53.986 --> 00:19:55.636
Now you'll see both
your app units

00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:58.076
and App Store views
plotted on the same chart.

00:19:58.846 --> 00:20:01.466
The default view here, we're
looking at a dual-axes graph.

00:20:01.586 --> 00:20:04.406
You can hover over any
day and see the value

00:20:04.406 --> 00:20:05.886
for each of those measures.

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:08.946
In the top-left corner you
can see the total value

00:20:08.946 --> 00:20:10.136
for each of those measures.

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:12.996
This is a really nice way
to view the relationship

00:20:12.996 --> 00:20:15.406
between these measures, see
how they trend over time.

00:20:15.946 --> 00:20:19.236
We are excited to announce
some new enhancements

00:20:19.266 --> 00:20:21.436
that we're bringing to
Compare To as of today.

00:20:22.626 --> 00:20:25.416
Instead of just being able to
view this on a dual-axes chart,

00:20:25.646 --> 00:20:29.216
we added the ability to
view this rate over time

00:20:29.466 --> 00:20:31.786
with the new feature
we call Ratios.

00:20:32.086 --> 00:20:34.246
So from here, you can
select new chart types,

00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:36.286
from Single Access and Ratio.

00:20:36.286 --> 00:20:37.496
We'll select Ratio.

00:20:37.996 --> 00:20:41.766
And now you can see the
ratio between your app units

00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:44.386
and App Store views
plotted over time.

00:20:44.996 --> 00:20:46.246
That gives you a nice picture

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.936
of that product page conversion
rate that Trystan talked about.

00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:52.816
You can see here that
we're at around 18 percent

00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:56.096
for the last 30 days,
but a few weeks ago

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:59.686
for Trip Guider 2.0 we made
some updates to our description

00:20:59.686 --> 00:21:01.436
of the app on the
App Store page.

00:21:01.776 --> 00:21:03.076
And thanks to App Analytics,

00:21:03.236 --> 00:21:07.216
we are able to see the product
page conversion rate drop off

00:21:07.546 --> 00:21:08.126
right here.

00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:09.776
We got down to about 6 percent.

00:21:10.316 --> 00:21:12.646
So what we did is we
went and updated the copy

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:15.006
to the description of
our App Store page,

00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:17.986
and we saw that product page
conversion rate rise over time.

00:21:18.506 --> 00:21:21.116
As you go on you can see
that now we are back up to

00:21:21.116 --> 00:21:23.326
around 30 percent
conversion rate.

00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:26.836
Great. Now I've shown you how to
use some of the power features

00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:29.256
in the metrics view, and I'll
hand it back over to Trystan.

00:21:30.126 --> 00:21:31.276
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: So
David went through metrics.

00:21:31.276 --> 00:21:33.366
This is the best way to
explore and discover things

00:21:33.366 --> 00:21:34.686
and reveal those
missed opportunities

00:21:34.686 --> 00:21:35.606
within App Analytics.

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:36.626
If you want to dive deeper

00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:38.536
than the overview,
this is that feature.

00:21:39.386 --> 00:21:41.646
One question we have
not answered yet is,

00:21:41.816 --> 00:21:43.186
how do people find your app?

00:21:43.446 --> 00:21:46.036
This is a question that is
hard without App Analytics.

00:21:46.446 --> 00:21:48.696
To do this, we have a
feature called Sources.

00:21:49.126 --> 00:21:51.636
App Analytics has
two types of sources.

00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:54.426
The first is completely
organic and free.

00:21:54.426 --> 00:21:56.676
You do not need to do any work
to take advantage of this.

00:21:56.676 --> 00:21:57.616
This is websites.

00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:01.036
If you are actively marketing
your application on websites,

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:04.256
forums, maybe it's getting
picked up by the press as well.

00:22:04.696 --> 00:22:08.096
Websites, any time a link to
your App Store page is present,

00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:11.456
we capture the web-referring
URL and present

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.416
that to you in App Analytics.

00:22:13.756 --> 00:22:17.096
It is important that these,
both websites and campaigns,

00:22:17.096 --> 00:22:18.886
they slice across
your entire data set.

00:22:19.286 --> 00:22:23.216
You are able to filter App
Store views, in-app purchases,

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:25.726
the new measures
such as Paying Users.

00:22:25.936 --> 00:22:27.826
You can filter these
by the website

00:22:27.826 --> 00:22:31.596
and see how effective those apps
are at increasing these metrics.

00:22:32.336 --> 00:22:33.986
Next we have campaigns.

00:22:34.366 --> 00:22:36.146
So websites is something
that you don't need

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.516
to do anything to
take advantage of.

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:40.026
If you log in today, you
should be pleasantly surprised

00:22:40.026 --> 00:22:42.176
that there are websites
available for your apps.

00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:44.516
Campaigns: you do
need to create them,

00:22:44.646 --> 00:22:46.466
and we will talk about this.

00:22:47.436 --> 00:22:48.986
The easiest way,
the vanilla way,

00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:51.726
to create them is your App Store
URL, you add a provider token.

00:22:52.156 --> 00:22:53.726
In our example, we have
one, two, three, four.

00:22:53.826 --> 00:22:55.246
That is not your provider token.

00:22:55.246 --> 00:22:59.606
If you use 1234, you won't get
campaigns in your dashboards.

00:23:00.986 --> 00:23:02.866
You can then add
a campaign token.

00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:06.626
My recommendation to you
is that we take an event

00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:08.476
and placement approach
with this.

00:23:08.576 --> 00:23:12.396
Think of WWDC as the event
and placement as newsletter

00:23:12.396 --> 00:23:13.686
or forums or home page.

00:23:13.946 --> 00:23:16.356
You combine these in a
single string, and that way

00:23:16.356 --> 00:23:19.076
when you see it in App
Analytics, you know what it was

00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:20.586
for and where it was running.

00:23:21.076 --> 00:23:23.966
There are all kinds of ways you
can do this, and we want you

00:23:23.966 --> 00:23:25.066
to experiment with it.

00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:26.416
We think it's really important.

00:23:27.576 --> 00:23:30.036
The next way to create
a campaign is StoreKit.

00:23:30.036 --> 00:23:32.586
If you're using StoreKit
today, all you need

00:23:32.586 --> 00:23:34.506
to do is add two parameters.

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:37.546
Add the Provider Token
parameter, it's a constant

00:23:37.546 --> 00:23:41.176
in this dictionary, and you add
your Campaign Token parameter.

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:44.466
If you are not using
StoreKit, it's an easy way

00:23:44.796 --> 00:23:48.716
to create an in-app App
Store-type experience.

00:23:49.056 --> 00:23:51.806
You can cross-promote your
own titles within StoreKit,

00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:54.156
and it's the best way to
get a nice conversion rate

00:23:54.236 --> 00:23:56.356
for installs within
your own app.

00:23:56.356 --> 00:23:57.776
It is designed by Apple.

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:00.516
You don't need to create
your own mimicked App Store

00:24:00.516 --> 00:24:01.076
within an app.

00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:04.966
The last way to create
campaigns is smart app banners.

00:24:05.506 --> 00:24:07.626
If you have a home page on which
you're advertising your apps

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:09.806
today, you've probably
seen this already.

00:24:10.966 --> 00:24:11.826
If you're creating an app

00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:13.166
and this is the first
time you're here,

00:24:13.396 --> 00:24:16.836
you can add a meta tag to your
home page and that meta tag,

00:24:16.836 --> 00:24:19.336
you can add a provider
token and campaign token

00:24:19.336 --> 00:24:23.046
to your affiliate data, and
that campaign will be attributed

00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:24.826
to all of the traffic
coming through.

00:24:25.446 --> 00:24:27.756
To demo this, David
will come up again.

00:24:27.756 --> 00:24:30.536
He's going to walk through
sources, how you see it.

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:32.616
He's also going to talk about
how you create a campaign

00:24:32.776 --> 00:24:34.736
and how you can get that
provider token from the UI.

00:24:36.176 --> 00:24:36.546
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Great.

00:24:36.546 --> 00:24:38.276
So as Trystan mentioned,
there's two types

00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:40.406
of sources we track
in App Analytics.

00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:43.286
You have your top websites
and your top campaigns.

00:24:43.926 --> 00:24:47.146
Websites are tracked any
time a user follows a link

00:24:47.146 --> 00:24:50.046
in mobile Safari to
your App Store page.

00:24:50.756 --> 00:24:53.636
For example, we have our
website for Trip Guider,

00:24:53.636 --> 00:24:55.636
which is Trip Guider.apple.com,

00:24:55.866 --> 00:24:57.846
and we've implemented a
smart banner that links

00:24:57.846 --> 00:24:59.086
to our App Store page.

00:24:59.496 --> 00:25:01.226
Any time a user follows
that link,

00:25:01.616 --> 00:25:03.256
it's going to generate
a App Store view.

00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:05.516
Any time the user goes
on to purchase the app,

00:25:05.516 --> 00:25:07.646
it will generate an app unit.

00:25:08.026 --> 00:25:10.196
And so on for sales,
and sessions,

00:25:10.436 --> 00:25:11.626
and all of your measures.

00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:14.126
This view should be familiar.

00:25:14.126 --> 00:25:16.506
It's the same view we
saw for our app list.

00:25:16.586 --> 00:25:18.886
Now we are looking
at our top websites.

00:25:19.816 --> 00:25:22.806
You can click on any of the
websites, and you'll be taken

00:25:22.806 --> 00:25:24.836
to the source overview
for that website.

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:27.626
Again, this view is going
to be familiar to you.

00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:30.576
It is the same view you
saw for your app overview.

00:25:30.856 --> 00:25:33.426
Now you are looking at
just your users who came

00:25:33.426 --> 00:25:35.306
from Trip Guider.apple.com.

00:25:35.886 --> 00:25:39.766
So the great thing
about websites is

00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:40.856
that you get them for free.

00:25:41.016 --> 00:25:43.846
You don't have to do anything
to implement your websites.

00:25:43.906 --> 00:25:45.506
They just show up automatically.

00:25:45.506 --> 00:25:48.916
Any link that goes to the App
Store page will just show up.

00:25:49.586 --> 00:25:51.806
The other type of source
we have is campaigns.

00:25:52.376 --> 00:25:55.176
Campaigns are great because
you can use them anywhere.

00:25:55.176 --> 00:25:56.816
They are not just
working on mobile Safari.

00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:57.736
Anywhere on iOS.

00:25:57.976 --> 00:26:00.776
We can send out an email,
put them on social media,

00:26:01.176 --> 00:26:02.796
but they require setup.

00:26:03.206 --> 00:26:06.566
So for most of you, when you
log in you'll see something

00:26:06.566 --> 00:26:08.576
like this like we have
for Trip Guider.com,

00:26:08.846 --> 00:26:10.696
which is an empty
list of our campaigns.

00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:13.576
I'll walk you through
how to set up a campaign.

00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:18.656
For Trip Guider, we want to
promote the use of Trip Guider

00:26:18.656 --> 00:26:22.056
in order to find
things to do for WWDC.

00:26:22.056 --> 00:26:24.366
I'll show you how to set
up that WWDC campaign.

00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:26.346
As Trystan mentioned,
all you have

00:26:26.346 --> 00:26:29.696
to do is add a provider token
and campaign token to your URL.

00:26:30.086 --> 00:26:32.556
But to make this even
easier, we have a tool

00:26:32.686 --> 00:26:34.646
that generates the
campaign link.

00:26:35.556 --> 00:26:38.336
When you follow this
link, you'll see here

00:26:39.846 --> 00:26:41.486
that you have a tool
and all you have,

00:26:41.486 --> 00:26:45.016
is you have your app selector,
so you can switch between apps,

00:26:45.016 --> 00:26:46.266
we have Trip Guider selected.

00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:49.316
And that will populate
your app's app ID as well

00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.486
as that provider ID that
Trystan talked about.

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:54.356
And here we can enter
the campaign name,

00:26:54.396 --> 00:26:59.696
so we'll say WWDC --
whoops, there we go.

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:02.926
2015. It generates
a campaign link.

00:27:03.716 --> 00:27:05.396
Now you can copy
this campaign link

00:27:05.396 --> 00:27:09.066
and you can put it anywhere, in
an email, on your social media.

00:27:09.346 --> 00:27:11.336
You'll start to see
your campaigns show up.

00:27:11.336 --> 00:27:13.296
It is also important to note

00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:15.856
that generating the
campaign link does not mean

00:27:15.856 --> 00:27:18.606
that you'll see the campaigns
in your top campaigns list.

00:27:19.256 --> 00:27:21.046
Campaigns will only
start to show

00:27:21.046 --> 00:27:22.596
up once you have five users.

00:27:22.706 --> 00:27:25.626
Follow that link and then
go and purchase your app.

00:27:26.816 --> 00:27:29.586
So now that I've shown you
how to generate a campaign,

00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:30.426
let's take a look at an app

00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:32.276
where we've already
started use campaigns.

00:27:32.586 --> 00:27:35.176
The easiest way to
switch between apps is

00:27:35.176 --> 00:27:36.826
to use the app switcher
in the top left.

00:27:37.306 --> 00:27:41.486
So we switch from Trip Guider
to our other app, Tide Minder.

00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:45.796
And now we can see
the list of campaigns

00:27:45.796 --> 00:27:47.446
that we set up for Tide Minder.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:49.386
So, for example, we
set up a campaign

00:27:49.386 --> 00:27:50.676
to track our home page here.

00:27:51.016 --> 00:27:53.196
So we have our display
home page campaign

00:27:53.316 --> 00:27:54.536
that is showing up in the list.

00:27:55.326 --> 00:27:57.686
Similar to what you
saw in the app overview

00:27:57.686 --> 00:28:00.496
and the top websites
overview, you can click on this

00:28:00.496 --> 00:28:03.396
and you will be taken to
your campaign overview

00:28:03.396 --> 00:28:06.266
where you can see a high level
of how this campaign is doing.

00:28:06.666 --> 00:28:08.006
So now I've shown you how

00:28:08.006 --> 00:28:09.766
to track these two
different types of sources.

00:28:09.766 --> 00:28:11.476
We hope that you go
out and start setting

00:28:11.476 --> 00:28:12.636
up campaigns right away.

00:28:12.986 --> 00:28:14.246
I'll hand it back
over to Trystan.

00:28:15.516 --> 00:28:19.106
[Applause]

00:28:19.606 --> 00:28:19.866
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: All right.

00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:20.856
Thank you, David.

00:28:21.136 --> 00:28:23.466
David covered the campaign
list, the website list.

00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:25.786
Very familiar to the
app list as well.

00:28:26.026 --> 00:28:28.126
It filters all of your data
by a particular website.

00:28:28.386 --> 00:28:30.626
We show the top campaigns
and the top websites here,

00:28:30.826 --> 00:28:32.726
and then we have the
overview so you can see all

00:28:32.726 --> 00:28:33.926
of it in a single shot.

00:28:34.176 --> 00:28:36.226
If you're running a campaign,
perhaps you're paying

00:28:36.226 --> 00:28:37.116
for the campaign as well.

00:28:37.346 --> 00:28:39.146
This is a great view to
just look at and see,

00:28:39.146 --> 00:28:40.316
how is it actually doing?

00:28:40.316 --> 00:28:42.636
Is it money well spent?

00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:44.446
Last question we'd
like to answer is,

00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:46.296
are customers returning
to the app?

00:28:46.586 --> 00:28:49.356
David mentioned there's
a retention widget inside

00:28:49.396 --> 00:28:50.036
the overview.

00:28:50.246 --> 00:28:52.136
We will go into this
in some more detail,

00:28:52.136 --> 00:28:53.656
go over the retention feature.

00:28:55.126 --> 00:28:57.236
Before we do that,
before we show the UI,

00:28:57.236 --> 00:29:00.216
I want to give a lesson on
how this actually works.

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:02.246
We have a purchase date.

00:29:02.336 --> 00:29:05.386
And what makes sense is that
100 percent of the customers

00:29:05.386 --> 00:29:07.586
who purchase the
app are customers

00:29:07.586 --> 00:29:08.306
on their purchase data.

00:29:08.306 --> 00:29:09.306
They've remained customers.

00:29:09.306 --> 00:29:09.926
They are retained.

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:13.706
What isn't as obvious is
that a couple days later

00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:15.436
and all the way up
to 30 days later,

00:29:15.826 --> 00:29:17.796
less of them are
actually active customers.

00:29:18.076 --> 00:29:21.876
So here we see day two, 45
percent are remaining customers,

00:29:21.876 --> 00:29:23.596
and then on day 30,
we see 10 percent.

00:29:23.776 --> 00:29:25.806
So what we're looking at here
is a single purchase date,

00:29:26.146 --> 00:29:27.406
and then seven days later,

00:29:27.406 --> 00:29:29.396
20 percent of the
customers are retained.

00:29:30.046 --> 00:29:31.116
We're going to bring this down,

00:29:31.116 --> 00:29:33.356
and we see that June 1
is our real example here.

00:29:33.356 --> 00:29:35.096
So June 1, two days later,

00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:37.016
45 percent of the
customers were retained.

00:29:37.846 --> 00:29:39.716
One purchase date is great
to look at, but you want

00:29:39.716 --> 00:29:42.346
to compare this because
you are making many changes

00:29:42.576 --> 00:29:43.736
over the course of
time and you want

00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:45.966
to compare multiple purchase
dates in a single shot.

00:29:46.446 --> 00:29:47.616
We added June 2.

00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:49.486
We have June 1 and 2 now.

00:29:49.806 --> 00:29:50.846
Let's expand that even more.

00:29:50.846 --> 00:29:51.466
That is not enough.

00:29:52.026 --> 00:29:53.826
Now I see June 1 to June 9.

00:29:53.826 --> 00:29:55.246
I'm looking at nine
purchase days.

00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:57.066
We've changed the
numbers now as well.

00:29:57.066 --> 00:30:01.246
At the top I have 45 percent
for two days after June 1.

00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:04.646
At the bottom, June
9, I have 60 percent.

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:06.976
So it's a little hard to read
because it's a single color.

00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:09.836
So what we've also done to
this heat map is we've added

00:30:10.256 --> 00:30:12.566
colorization, so I can
see that 10 percent

00:30:12.566 --> 00:30:15.716
of my customers 30 days
later have returned

00:30:15.716 --> 00:30:17.016
on the June 1 purchase date.

00:30:17.356 --> 00:30:18.816
That's a lighter
color indicating

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:21.146
that the retention is not
so good at that point.

00:30:21.446 --> 00:30:22.906
Go down to the bottom right,

00:30:22.906 --> 00:30:25.296
and I see a darker color
indicating there's a hotspot

00:30:25.296 --> 00:30:27.436
there, those improvements
we made.

00:30:27.726 --> 00:30:29.376
Maybe it was my App
Store presence,

00:30:29.686 --> 00:30:31.096
but likely it was the
new version of the app

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:33.566
or new content to the app to get
people to come back and use it,

00:30:34.016 --> 00:30:37.526
and I have a 60 percent
retention rate two days

00:30:37.526 --> 00:30:38.176
after June 9.

00:30:38.526 --> 00:30:39.756
That's how retention works.

00:30:40.636 --> 00:30:42.806
The easiest way to
understand it is to do a demo.

00:30:42.806 --> 00:30:44.126
So we are going to
do another demo here.

00:30:44.436 --> 00:30:45.676
David will walk through
retention.

00:30:46.476 --> 00:30:46.866
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Great.

00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:49.286
So retention is available
as another tab

00:30:49.286 --> 00:30:50.436
within the context of your app.

00:30:50.596 --> 00:30:53.316
We are looking at the retention
for our app Trip Guider.

00:30:53.856 --> 00:30:56.236
The first thing I'll talk
about is the retention grid,

00:30:56.236 --> 00:30:57.426
which Trystan introduced.

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:00.876
On the left-hand side, you'll
see the purchase date for each

00:31:00.876 --> 00:31:02.386
of the last 30 purchase days.

00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:05.326
Next to that, you'll
see a number of devices.

00:31:05.326 --> 00:31:07.596
That's the number of
devices that installed

00:31:07.596 --> 00:31:08.756
on that purchase date.

00:31:10.066 --> 00:31:12.316
On the top of the grid
you'll see a number.

00:31:12.316 --> 00:31:14.676
That is the number of days
since the purchase date.

00:31:14.676 --> 00:31:17.046
So when we look at this number
one, it means we are looking

00:31:17.046 --> 00:31:18.976
at one day after
the purchase date.

00:31:19.706 --> 00:31:22.276
The easiest way to
understand the retention grid

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:25.286
if you are getting lost
is to hover over any cell,

00:31:25.286 --> 00:31:26.736
and it gives you a
nice explanation.

00:31:27.136 --> 00:31:29.356
So we'll hover over this
32 percent, and it says,

00:31:29.836 --> 00:31:32.806
"32 percent of the devices
that installed the app

00:31:32.806 --> 00:31:35.646
on May 13 were active
two days later."

00:31:37.216 --> 00:31:40.096
So oftentimes you'll
hear people talk

00:31:40.096 --> 00:31:41.946
about their day seven retention.

00:31:41.946 --> 00:31:43.716
And as an app developer,

00:31:43.716 --> 00:31:47.116
you know that people will
purchase your app and a lot

00:31:47.116 --> 00:31:49.366
of times they come back
on day one or day two,

00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:51.236
but then the usage
starts to fall off.

00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:54.506
We like to measure a day
that is a little further out.

00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:56.676
That's why day seven
retention is important.

00:31:57.326 --> 00:32:00.176
We make this easy to see
within App Analytics.

00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:02.436
All you need to do
is click on the seven

00:32:02.436 --> 00:32:05.496
and you can see your day
seven retention over time.

00:32:05.946 --> 00:32:07.936
As the app developer,
your goal should be

00:32:07.996 --> 00:32:10.396
to keep the users
engaged and try to drive

00:32:10.396 --> 00:32:12.486
up the day seven
retention over time.

00:32:12.486 --> 00:32:15.346
You can see that we start
out around 18 percent.

00:32:15.586 --> 00:32:17.926
As time goes on, we are
increasing a little bit,

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:20.676
but our goal should be really
to keep our users engaged

00:32:20.926 --> 00:32:22.366
for day seven and beyond.

00:32:22.906 --> 00:32:26.696
You can also look at any
single purchase date and look

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:28.006
at the retention for that date.

00:32:28.006 --> 00:32:30.426
So, for example, if we want
to look at our retention

00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:32.716
on May 12, we can click on that.

00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:36.426
You can see in the top left, now
we have a graph of our retention

00:32:36.426 --> 00:32:39.016
for our users who
purchased on May 12.

00:32:39.726 --> 00:32:43.796
It starts at around 48
percent on day one and goes

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:46.546
on as time goes on and
goes to around 8 percent.

00:32:46.576 --> 00:32:49.936
Again, we want to focus here
on driving up our retention.

00:32:51.216 --> 00:32:52.266
The last thing I want to point

00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:55.056
out on the retention view is
the ability to add a filter.

00:32:55.496 --> 00:32:58.646
Just like you saw on the
metrics view, we can also filter

00:32:58.646 --> 00:33:01.026
by any dimension and
look at the retention

00:33:01.026 --> 00:33:02.546
for just that dimension.

00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:07.026
We can add a filter and
look at just our retention

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:08.076
for our users on the iPad.

00:33:09.406 --> 00:33:10.596
Now the retention updates.

00:33:11.436 --> 00:33:12.796
Great, that's the
end of my demo.

00:33:12.796 --> 00:33:14.836
I hand it back to
Trystan who will wrap

00:33:14.836 --> 00:33:16.206
up our session on App Analytics.

00:33:17.516 --> 00:33:20.896
[Applause]

00:33:21.396 --> 00:33:22.556
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA:
Great, thank you, David.

00:33:22.946 --> 00:33:23.796
That was retention.

00:33:23.796 --> 00:33:26.426
This is answering the question,
are users returning to the app?

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:29.966
We covered a lot today,
first thing was the app list.

00:33:30.146 --> 00:33:32.266
This is bird's eye view
of all of your iOS apps.

00:33:32.876 --> 00:33:34.086
We also support bundles.

00:33:34.086 --> 00:33:37.486
So we have page views, units,
and sales for app bundles.

00:33:37.486 --> 00:33:40.476
These are storefront
and sales measures.

00:33:41.466 --> 00:33:42.736
Next, he covered the overview.

00:33:42.876 --> 00:33:44.716
This is your app at a glance.

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:45.986
All of the measures
are available.

00:33:45.986 --> 00:33:47.586
There's the nice
retention widget.

00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:51.346
You have the map as
well as the pie chart

00:33:51.386 --> 00:33:54.056
for the platforms as well.

00:33:54.256 --> 00:33:56.506
Metrics, you use this to explore

00:33:56.506 --> 00:33:58.216
and discover new
trends within your app.

00:33:58.536 --> 00:33:59.926
You can see the dimensions
are available.

00:34:00.206 --> 00:34:01.656
We have the new metrics as well.

00:34:01.986 --> 00:34:03.686
We have Paying Users
and Crashes,

00:34:03.726 --> 00:34:06.286
those are new as of today.

00:34:06.476 --> 00:34:08.085
Sources answers that
question of,

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:10.396
how are customers
finding my app?

00:34:10.716 --> 00:34:12.676
Are they actually turning
into real customers?

00:34:12.956 --> 00:34:15.036
We have the page views, which
are potential customers.

00:34:15.326 --> 00:34:17.976
Are they turning into engaged
and purchasing customers?

00:34:18.716 --> 00:34:22.306
Finally, are customers
returning to your app?

00:34:22.306 --> 00:34:23.936
We answer this question
with retention.

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:25.956
We are excited about
App Analytics.

00:34:26.025 --> 00:34:27.906
We hope you use it
to build better apps.

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.085
We hope this conference has
been a great week for you.

00:34:30.966 --> 00:34:32.396
For more information, look

00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:34.886
at the App Analytics
Developer Guide and look

00:34:34.886 --> 00:34:36.235
at the developer forums.

00:34:36.676 --> 00:34:40.576
We encourage you to talk to the
Evangelist as well, Mark Malone.

00:34:40.985 --> 00:34:43.446
We will be downstairs
after this in a lab

00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:44.485
for a short amount of time.

00:34:44.766 --> 00:34:46.876
We also will be available
for Thursday's lab as well.

00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:48.846
There are a couple
related sessions,

00:34:48.906 --> 00:34:50.496
Promoting Your App with an IAd.

00:34:50.795 --> 00:34:52.226
This already aired, so
we encourage you to look

00:34:52.226 --> 00:34:55.916
on the video afterwards, and
the What's New in iTunes Connect

00:34:56.025 --> 00:34:57.136
that occurred this morning.

00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:58.566
This is a great session.

00:34:58.566 --> 00:35:00.926
We walked through new
metrics that will be available

00:35:00.926 --> 00:35:03.356
in the fall for TestFlight,
and there's How

00:35:03.426 --> 00:35:05.986
to Manage Your Store
Presence as well.

00:35:07.776 --> 00:35:10.866
The labs again this
afternoon and tomorrow,

00:35:11.146 --> 00:35:13.606

analytics team will be there

00:35:13.606 --> 00:35:14.456
to answer your questions.

00:35:14.926 --> 00:35:15.606
Have a great week.

00:35:15.726 --> 00:35:16.386
Thank you very much.

00:35:17.516 --> 00:35:20.500
