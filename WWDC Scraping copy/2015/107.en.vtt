00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:27.936
>> Jason Beaver: Good afternoon.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.216
Welcome to What's
New in Cocoa Touch.

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:30.716
I'm Jason Beaver, I'm one

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:33.036
of the senior engineering
managers in the iOS group.

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:37.576
There is a lot that's
new to discuss in iOS 9,

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.986
but first I want to take a look
back at some changes we've made

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:42.276
over the past few years.

00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:48.056
Since iOS 6 we've been laying
the groundwork for major change

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:51.016
in how applications are built
for iOS and we've been rolling

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:53.846
out the changes in
each major release.

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:57.786
In iOS 6 we added autolayout.

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:00.576
This allows you to
easily build a dynamic

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:03.246
and versatile interface
that responds to changes

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:06.406
in available size and
screen orientation,

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:07.786
as well as localization.

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:12.476
In iOS 7 we introduced
dynamic type

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:15.426
and this lets you achieve
beautiful typography

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:18.736
in your application in a variety
of users' selectable text sizes.

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:20.926
And coupled with autolayout,

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:24.006
your interface will adapt
automatically to changes

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.816
in the user's selected text size
and by adopting dynamic type,

00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:31.526
the system can make improvements
to the text rendering and layout

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:33.356
that your application
will inherent for free.

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:39.006
In iOS 8 we made what is
perhaps the biggest change.

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:40.886
We introduced the
concept of adaptivity.

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:44.576
This is the concept that
your application should adapt

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.806
to changes in the
running environment.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.396
Fundamental to this
concept is size classes.

00:01:50.906 --> 00:01:54.916
Size classes drive
structural changes

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:57.026
to your applications'
user interface based

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:58.836
on whether space is constrained

00:01:58.836 --> 00:02:00.206
in a particular dimension
or not.

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:05.136
In the settings application
shown here this is the identical

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:08.395
code running on both
an iPad and an iPhone.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:11.246
The difference in size classes
driven structural changes

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:12.596
to the user interface.

00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:17.376
Size classes drives the
adaptivity of many parts

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:21.436
of the iKit view controllers,
view controller presentations,

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:25.186
search results, action
sheets, and many more,

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:29.516
all of these adapt to the size
class and to the available space

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.576
that they have to work with.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.586
When we introduced the concept

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:37.856
of adaptivity last year it
wasn't clear why we were moving

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:38.546
in this direction.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.106
In applications we're
always full screen

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:42.646
and they generally did not need

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:46.446
to change their user interface
structure while the application

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:46.946
was running.

00:02:48.386 --> 00:02:50.156
With the introduction
of multitasking,

00:02:50.886 --> 00:02:52.746
the reason for the
changes is now clear.

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.626
You're no longer building two
distinct experiences tailored

00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.296
to specific pieces of hardware.

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:04.046
You're providing a continuum of
experiences tailored to the size

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:06.406
that your user is
running the app at.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.736
Adopting these foundational
technologies,

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:12.166
not only is your app ready for
the entire range of hardware

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:14.376
that we ship, it is also ready

00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:16.396
to support these new
multitasking features

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:18.286
and developers that we worked

00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:20.896
with that had already
adopted all of these changes

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:24.566
and in some cases literally
only needed a matter of minutes

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:25.996
to get their app ready

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:28.196
to run seamlessly
alongside our own apps.

00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:32.916
One special case to deal
with is picture-in-picture,

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:36.926
if your application supports
background media playback you

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:40.506
can use new API in iOS
9 to enable your player

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.706
to support picture-in-picture.

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:44.506
Keep in mind that with
picture-in-picture as well

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:47.826
as all of multitasking,
your application needs

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:50.206
to be a good citizen to make
sure it is not interfering

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:52.046
with the overall
user experience.

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:56.986
We have a number of sessions
on multitasking this week,

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.206
Getting Started with
Multitasking on iPad,

00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:02.136
Multitasking Essentials
for Media-based Apps

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:04.746
and Optimizing your
App for Multitasking.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:09.566
Let's move on and talk about
things that are new in iOS 9.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.396
The first is autolayout.

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:18.706
We're introducing a new UI
layout guide class in cases

00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:21.446
where you would have
used extra views

00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:25.226
in your autolayout constraints
you now can use layout guides

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.096
to avoid cluttering up
your view hierarchy.

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:32.266
There are two layout guides
we're introducing by default,

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:36.426
layout margins guide and
readable content guide.

00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:39.016
We can use these
properties on UIView

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:42.266
to allow more expressiveness
in defining

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.216
where within a view
content should be drawn.

00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:49.086
These supersede layout margins
that we've introduced in iOS 8

00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:52.146
and you should use layout
guides in any new code you write

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:54.926
and as you revisit old code
you should replace margins

00:04:54.926 --> 00:04:55.706
with layout guides.

00:04:56.026 --> 00:05:00.036
I want to take a moment though
to talk about the second case,

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:01.786
the readable content guide.

00:05:03.476 --> 00:05:07.106
When you have large
bodies of text,

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:09.846
the length of the line
has a great deal to do

00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:12.446
with the readability and
legibility of that text.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:17.766
If the lines are too wide, as
we see here, it's harder to see

00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:21.206
where a line begins and ends and
it can be difficult to continue

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:22.856
onto the next line
when you're reading.

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:26.646
Conversely, if the lines
are too narrow your eye has

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.546
to travel back too frequently

00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:29.986
which interrupts
the flow of reading.

00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:33.966
The optimal line length is
dependent on many factors,

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.596
including the font, the
size, and line spacing,

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:39.786
but by using the
readable content guide,

00:05:40.446 --> 00:05:43.126
you can be assured that your
text will be readable regardless

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:46.746
of the user's text size
or the available space

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:48.426
that your application
has to render the text.

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:50.646
Let's talk about how
layout guides can be used

00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:51.936
to reduce the number of
views in your application.

00:05:52.006 --> 00:06:00.346
Let's say we have a view that
shows a number of planets

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:03.626
and we want to show them all
centered in their parent view

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:06.676
or show them spread
out along the x axis.

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:09.786
Before using autolayout
constraints we would've had

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.496
to introduce a number
of extra views

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:13.086
into the view hierarchy
to do that.

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:15.626
We can now simply
define the layout guides

00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.496
that define the proportion
of the space

00:06:17.946 --> 00:06:22.046
that the view is
using when laid out.

00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:26.696
We also will create an
additional set of constraints

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:30.856
that will center the views
and then simply by changing

00:06:30.856 --> 00:06:34.216
which set of constraints is
active we get a nice animation

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:34.836
like this.

00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:37.446
In this case we're changing
all of the constraints

00:06:37.446 --> 00:06:41.336
at the same time but if
we instead change the set

00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:44.846
of constraints at different
times using a keyframe animation

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:47.756
we can achieve a number of
very interesting effects.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:55.376
We're also bringing the
StackView over to iOS in iOS 9.

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:59.856
This allows you to manage
a set of sub views as stack

00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:02.106
that can be arranged either
horizontally or vertically,

00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:06.226
the StackView uses autolayout
under the covers but manages all

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:07.396
of the constraints for you.

00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:11.016
It allows you to adjust
the spacing alignment,

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:14.826
it can allow you to adjust
how the views are distributed

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:17.316
within the available
space either equally

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:18.136
or proportionately.

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:21.276
StackViews also can be nested.

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:26.236
You can have a StackView
as an element

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:29.166
in another StackView allowing
you to create very rich layouts.

00:07:29.686 --> 00:07:32.716
These layouts will
automatically adjust

00:07:32.716 --> 00:07:35.916
to the content being
displayed as well

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:39.936
as to the available
space that's there.

00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:42.616
So we also introduced
shortcuts bar.

00:07:43.176 --> 00:07:46.496
This appears over the software
keyboard or at the bottom

00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:48.536
of the screen when the
hardware keyboard is attached.

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:53.556
This bar contains stock controls
for things like bold, italic,

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.506
underline and cut,
copy and paste.

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:58.216
It can also be customized
in your application.

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:03.966
Anything that conforms to the UI
text input protocol can return

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.036
an input-assistant
item using this method.

00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:11.566
UI text input-assistant
item is a new class in iOS 9

00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:15.816
and has two properties
for specifying the leading

00:08:15.846 --> 00:08:17.576
and trailing bar-button groups

00:08:17.576 --> 00:08:23.066
so you can easily add your
own elements in there.

00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:26.846
Now, as you saw in the State
of the Union, we no longer have

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.226
to have the entire
interface for your application

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:30.356
in a single storyboard.

00:08:30.356 --> 00:08:33.395
You can now link from one
storyboard to another.

00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:37.176
We also offer a way
now to unwind segues.

00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:43.486
[ Applause ]

00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:47.106
Also as you saw, we now have
full right-to-left support

00:08:47.106 --> 00:08:48.106
in the operating system.

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:51.716
If you have a localization
for a right-to-left language

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:53.136
and have linked to your app

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:55.406
on iOS 9 this will
happen automatically

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:56.436
in your app as well.

00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:00.246
All UI Kit controls will
automatically reverse.

00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:02.686
Notice that navigation
is reversed,

00:09:03.446 --> 00:09:05.186
all of the animations
are reversed,

00:09:05.536 --> 00:09:08.916
layout of table view cells,
even controls like sliders

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:10.396
and switches are all reversed.

00:09:11.746 --> 00:09:14.506
Collection view will
automatically reverse its layout

00:09:14.506 --> 00:09:15.926
and will flow from
right-to-left.

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:18.986
Here we see that the swipe to
the leader mark requires a swipe

00:09:18.986 --> 00:09:20.486
to the right and marking

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:22.946
as unread requires
a swipe to the left.

00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:32.856
There's two properties
on both view controller

00:09:32.856 --> 00:09:34.896
and view called semantic
content attribute

00:09:35.696 --> 00:09:39.256
that let you specify how
content should lay out.

00:09:39.406 --> 00:09:42.246
By default, everything
will flip automatically,

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:46.776
but you can override the
properties to customize

00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:48.386
that if it makes sense
in your application.

00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:51.566
There is also a method to
get the layout direction

00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:58.956
for a particular
content attribute.

00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:02.136
The semantic content attribute
has one of five values,

00:10:02.266 --> 00:10:03.496
the first is unspecified.

00:10:03.496 --> 00:10:04.456
This is the default.

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:07.446
Unless you have a reason to
change what UI Kit is doing,

00:10:07.446 --> 00:10:09.176
this is the value you
should leave it at.

00:10:10.806 --> 00:10:15.116
If you have a set of controls
that represent playback controls

00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:18.216
like play, fast forward
and rewind,

00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:20.386
you can use the playback
content attribute.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:25.696
If you have a set of controls
that represent or result

00:10:25.696 --> 00:10:27.966
in some sort of directional
change in your UI,

00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:30.926
so let's say text alignment
controls, left, center,

00:10:30.926 --> 00:10:34.296
right in a text editor,
you can use the spatial

00:10:34.296 --> 00:10:35.266
content attribute.

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:38.286
Finally, there is
two additional values

00:10:38.616 --> 00:10:40.436
that lets you force
either left to right

00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:41.676
or right-to-left layout.

00:10:46.016 --> 00:10:50.026
Now, for images, UI Kit can't
know whether an image should be

00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:51.676
flipped by default in all cases,

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:53.836
things that represent user
content like photographs,

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:56.516
shouldn't be flipped but
things that represent controls

00:10:56.516 --> 00:10:58.166
in your application
you may want to flip.

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:02.666
So we have a property
or a method on UI image

00:11:02.756 --> 00:11:06.436
from right-to-left to allow
you to tell us that you want

00:11:06.436 --> 00:11:09.556
to use a flipped image
and also a property to ask

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:10.636
if that image has been flipped.

00:11:10.716 --> 00:11:14.466
I encourage you all to come
to the new UI Kit support

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.266
for international
interfaces and find

00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:19.476
out how you can make your app
support right-to-left languages.

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:26.176
For accessibility you
now have the ability

00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:28.676
to use more speech
voices like Alex as well

00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:31.616
as high-quality voices
in AV speech synthesis.

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:36.326
I encourage you to come out
to iOS Accessibility to find

00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:38.776
out more about how to
make your app accessible.

00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:44.376
You also saw that we're
introducing a number

00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:47.486
of new text editing
gestures in iOS 9.

00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:51.786
These gestures can be
performed either on the keyboard

00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:54.706
at the bottom of the screen
or in the text area itself.

00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:58.746
They allow you to move the
insertion point indirectly,

00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:02.386
they allow you to
select a word, sentence,

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:07.026
or paragraph very easily just by
multiple taps and also allow you

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:09.186
to easily extend an
existing selection.

00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:13.626
Coupled with the shortcut bar
we introduced, it allows you

00:12:13.626 --> 00:12:16.996
to easily access, copy and paste
without moving up to the text.

00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:20.626
Text interaction manipulation
has never been easier or faster.

00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:24.676
Now, there's nothing you need
to do in your application

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:26.786
to adopt these text
editing gestures,

00:12:27.326 --> 00:12:30.366
but if you have customized
the gestures in a text view

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:31.436
within your application,

00:12:31.856 --> 00:12:33.346
you should make sure
they're not conflicting

00:12:33.346 --> 00:12:37.806
with the new system
text gestures.

00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:41.916
In iOS 7 we added support for
application to find keyboard,

00:12:42.156 --> 00:12:43.876
hardware keyboard commands.

00:12:44.786 --> 00:12:46.966
App could have their own
commands like command

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:48.316
in to create a new document.

00:12:49.376 --> 00:12:50.886
This was a benefit
to power users

00:12:50.886 --> 00:12:53.026
who already knew these
commands but there was no way

00:12:53.026 --> 00:12:54.696
to discover what
these commands are.

00:12:55.636 --> 00:12:59.636
In iOS 9 we're introducing a new
keyboard command discoverability

00:12:59.636 --> 00:13:02.656
HUD and if you press
and hold the command key

00:13:02.896 --> 00:13:07.116
on the hardware keyboard and
hold it for just a moment,

00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:09.676
the HUD will appear and
show you the set of commands

00:13:09.676 --> 00:13:12.476
that are available at
that particular moment.

00:13:12.476 --> 00:13:14.496
Notice that this is
context dependent.

00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:16.996
Depending on the state
of your application

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.246
at that time you'll get a
different set of commands.

00:13:19.356 --> 00:13:22.866
So, instead of seeing the
entire set and some enabled

00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:25.586
and some are disabled, you
only see the ones that apply.

00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:29.376
All you need to do to adopt
this in your application is

00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:33.186
to set the discoverability title
for each of your key commands.

00:13:33.426 --> 00:13:35.536
UI Kit will take care
automatically to figure

00:13:35.536 --> 00:13:42.066
out what commands are applicable
in that moment in time.

00:13:42.326 --> 00:13:44.246
Let's take a moment to
talk about touch events.

00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:46.206
When a touch is tracking

00:13:46.206 --> 00:13:48.346
on the screen there
is some inherent lag

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:52.356
between where the finger is
and any resulting drawing

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:53.436
that you see on the screen.

00:13:54.396 --> 00:13:58.686
It simply takes time to
scan the hardware to do all

00:13:58.686 --> 00:14:01.016
of the intermediate
processing and drawing

00:14:01.016 --> 00:14:02.786
and then flush the
results to that display.

00:14:03.756 --> 00:14:05.866
This is called the
touch-to-display latency.

00:14:06.326 --> 00:14:08.796
Most users will never
notice this latency

00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:10.576
under most circumstances.

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:13.446
It's perceptable when the user
moves their finger fast enough.

00:14:14.606 --> 00:14:17.516
Despite the fact that iOS
already has industry-leading

00:14:17.596 --> 00:14:20.786
touch-to-diplay latency,
in iOS 9 we set

00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:23.216
out to dramatically
improve this latency.

00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:26.956
When a touch is tracking
on the screen,

00:14:27.856 --> 00:14:29.996
UI Kit is notifying
the application

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:32.826
with each screen refresh so
that the application can update

00:14:32.976 --> 00:14:34.656
its state.

00:14:35.106 --> 00:14:36.866
In some of our more
recent hardware,

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:40.896
the touches are updated more
frequently than the display is.

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:44.196
So there is now a new
method to get access

00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:47.236
to any intermediate touches
since the last display refresh.

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:51.206
For drawing applications this
can result in much smoother

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:52.376
and more accurate drawing.

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:56.286
As a first step to improving

00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:59.356
that touch-to-display latency
we now offer touch prediction

00:14:59.356 --> 00:14:59.846
as well.

00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:03.866
This uses a sophisticated
algorithm that looks

00:15:03.866 --> 00:15:06.686
at the touches velocity,
acceleration and curvature

00:15:06.976 --> 00:15:08.676
to predict where
the touch is headed.

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:13.216
That lets you reduce the
apparent latency for drawing

00:15:13.216 --> 00:15:17.956
where the touch will be rather
than where the touch is.

00:15:19.676 --> 00:15:25.116
[ Applause ]

00:15:25.616 --> 00:15:26.866
We went much further than that.

00:15:27.016 --> 00:15:28.756
In addition to offering
touch prediction,

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:32.086
we have made a number of changes
throughout the entire software

00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:36.626
stack to reduce the latency
from over 60 milliseconds which,

00:15:36.626 --> 00:15:38.416
as I said, is already
industry leading,

00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:40.766
to less than 30 milliseconds.

00:15:42.516 --> 00:15:48.596
[ Applause ]

00:15:49.096 --> 00:15:52.896
We have also introduced a number
of changes in UI Kit dynamics.

00:15:54.116 --> 00:15:56.886
The first of these is now
we support non-rectangular

00:15:56.886 --> 00:15:59.806
collision bounds.

00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:04.376
[ Applause ]

00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:07.326
In addition to rectangular
we now support elliptical

00:16:07.326 --> 00:16:09.636
and path-based collisions
and this results

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.396
in much more realistic
collision interactions.

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:18.156
We also support a wide
variety of field behaviors.

00:16:19.206 --> 00:16:21.926
We now have linear and radial
gravity like you see here,

00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:27.736
spring, drag and velocity, or
noise and turbulence fields

00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:31.986
like you see here, electric
and magnetic fields as well.

00:16:32.916 --> 00:16:35.096
We also support the
ability for you

00:16:35.136 --> 00:16:38.076
to define your own
field effects.

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:43.526
Finally, we have added a number

00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:45.246
of new additional
attachment types.

00:16:46.116 --> 00:16:49.076
Before we had a very simple
way to attach two objects

00:16:49.076 --> 00:16:50.986
and if you wanted to
constrain their movement

00:16:50.986 --> 00:16:53.936
in some way you had to set up a
number of external constraints.

00:16:54.606 --> 00:16:56.646
Now with these additional
attachment types,

00:16:56.926 --> 00:17:00.526
it can dramatically simplify
how you build your UI

00:17:00.526 --> 00:17:01.286
dynamics model.

00:17:04.876 --> 00:17:09.175
We're also adding the ability
to animate the blur radius.

00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:14.705
[ Applause ]

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:17.955
To let you receive beautiful
effects here like you see here,

00:17:17.955 --> 00:17:20.626
moving into and out
of spotlight.

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:25.185
We've also made a number
of EPI changes in iOS 9

00:17:25.425 --> 00:17:28.185
to optimize their
use with Swift.

00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:33.546
This is taking advantage of
the better expressiveness

00:17:33.546 --> 00:17:37.856
that Swift offers and to improve
compile-time type checking.

00:17:38.386 --> 00:17:44.266
For nullability, you can now
specify whether properties

00:17:44.266 --> 00:17:46.506
actions and return
values can be nil or not.

00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:49.856
We have gone through our entire
API and defined where it's valid

00:17:49.856 --> 00:17:52.656
to have nil arguments
or nil return values

00:17:52.966 --> 00:17:57.976
or whether it is
guaranteed not to be nil.

00:17:58.126 --> 00:17:59.756
We also have lightweight
generics.

00:17:59.886 --> 00:18:02.426
This is a lightweight form
of type parameterization

00:18:02.486 --> 00:18:06.166
that lets us better express
Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs.

00:18:06.546 --> 00:18:10.646
For example the sub views method
on UI views can now be typed

00:18:10.876 --> 00:18:15.286
to return an array of UI views
instead of an array of just ids.

00:18:15.836 --> 00:18:19.586
You can find out more about
this in What's New in Swift.

00:18:20.046 --> 00:18:26.616
New in iOS 9 is the
ability for notifications

00:18:26.616 --> 00:18:30.466
to allow text input for the user
or from the user in the same way

00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:34.786
as quick reply for
text messages.

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:37.776
[ Applause ]

00:18:38.276 --> 00:18:41.916
The UI user-notification
action class has a new behavior

00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:44.996
property and if set to
the text-input behavior,

00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:48.706
your notification has
a text field allowing

00:18:48.706 --> 00:18:49.656
for a quick reply.

00:18:51.516 --> 00:18:55.116
[ Applause ]

00:18:55.616 --> 00:18:58.446
There is also an additional
action parameters dictionary

00:18:58.446 --> 00:19:01.186
that allows you to customize
the title of the Send button.

00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:04.326
You can find more at
What's New in Notifications.

00:19:04.836 --> 00:19:07.516
We're also introducing a new
SF Safari view controller

00:19:07.516 --> 00:19:10.726
and this allows you
to display web content

00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:15.186
in a native app surrounded by
all the key Safari UI elements

00:19:15.186 --> 00:19:17.306
that are already
familiar to your users.

00:19:18.206 --> 00:19:19.796
It even supports
advanced features

00:19:19.796 --> 00:19:21.176
like Reader and autofill.

00:19:21.176 --> 00:19:26.026
You can find more at Introducing
Safari View Controller.

00:19:26.026 --> 00:19:28.906
For iOS 9, we're introducing a
number of new extension points

00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:31.376
that allow you to extend other
applications in the system.

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:35.236
For VPN we have three
new extension points.

00:19:35.996 --> 00:19:38.616
There is a packet-tunnel
provider which allows you

00:19:38.616 --> 00:19:41.586
to build the client side of
your own VPN-tunneling protocol.

00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:45.616
There is an app-proxy
provider that allows you

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:46.906
to implement the client side

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:50.516
of your own custom transparent
network proxy protocol

00:19:51.086 --> 00:19:54.486
and a filter-control provider
and filter-data provider

00:19:54.586 --> 00:19:56.986
that allows you to
perform dynamic on-device

00:19:57.076 --> 00:19:57.966
content filtering.

00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:01.056
For Safari there's two
new extension points.

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:05.066
Shared Links lets your
application specify content

00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:09.266
that should appear in the
shared links users feed.

00:20:10.456 --> 00:20:14.476
The content blocking extension
allows you to identify subsets

00:20:14.476 --> 00:20:16.576
of content or resources
on a page

00:20:16.576 --> 00:20:17.856
and prevent them from showing.

00:20:18.386 --> 00:20:28.886
For Spotlight, there's now an
extension that allows the system

00:20:28.886 --> 00:20:34.266
to index your application
data and it can also do this

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:41.376
in the background so you don't
have to fire up your application

00:20:41.376 --> 00:20:43.106
to re-index your apps content.

You can find out more at
Introducing App Search.

00:20:50.406 --> 00:20:54.356
Finally, audio units or core
audio plug-ins that can act

00:20:54.356 --> 00:20:57.466
as musical instruments, audio
effects or audio generators,

00:20:58.896 --> 00:21:01.256
and until now iOS
users were limited

00:21:01.256 --> 00:21:03.866
to the built-in audio
units provided by Apple.

00:21:05.236 --> 00:21:07.476
In iOS 9 we added a
new extension point

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:10.016
and you can bring your
audio units to iOS.

Framework for iOS in iOS 10.

00:21:42.076 --> 00:21:46.446
For Wallet and Passkit, you can
now provision cards from scratch

00:21:46.446 --> 00:21:48.166
in bank and merchant
applications

00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:49.466
if you have a special
entitlement.

00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:55.636
You can also suppress ApplePay
from coming up in situations

00:21:55.636 --> 00:21:57.556
where it would interfere
with your application.

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:00.956
So say your application
needs to display a barcode

00:22:01.256 --> 00:22:03.546
in an environment where
there's an NFC terminal present.

00:22:03.876 --> 00:22:05.456
Normally that would
make ApplePay appear.

00:22:05.456 --> 00:22:08.976
You can suppress that so that
your barcode can be scanned.

00:22:09.046 --> 00:22:12.546
In core location, for
apps linked against iOS 9

00:22:12.546 --> 00:22:13.826
or later there are some changes

00:22:13.826 --> 00:22:16.196
to how the background
location tracking works.

00:22:17.036 --> 00:22:21.876
There is also a new bit of
API on CL Location Manager

00:22:22.736 --> 00:22:24.616
to request a one-time
location update

00:22:24.616 --> 00:22:28.306
if you don't need ongoing
updates to location,

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:29.786
this is a much more
efficient way

00:22:29.926 --> 00:22:30.986
to get the user's
current location.

00:22:32.516 --> 00:22:36.586
[ Applause ]

00:22:37.086 --> 00:22:40.226
For MapKit there is several
new features with a map view,

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:42.966
the first is access
to 3d Flyover View.

00:22:44.676 --> 00:22:47.546
[ Applause ]

00:22:48.046 --> 00:22:50.976
You can now show traffic as
well as the compass and scale

00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:54.336
and create your own
custom callouts now.

00:22:56.516 --> 00:22:59.546
[ Applause ]

00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:03.726
In HealthKit you have direct
real-time access to sensor data

00:23:03.836 --> 00:23:08.766
in Watch OS 2 and there is
a number of new data types.

00:23:09.396 --> 00:23:12.486
Tracking users intake of
water, tracking their exposure

00:23:12.486 --> 00:23:14.606
to sunlight and reproductive
health.

00:23:15.856 --> 00:23:18.586
There is new APIs for
better device tracking

00:23:18.586 --> 00:23:21.486
of HealthKit data, better
support for deleting data

00:23:22.096 --> 00:23:24.966
and a new workout session
API to track exercise.

00:23:25.566 --> 00:23:28.886
We announced ResearchKit a
few months ago to make it easy

00:23:28.886 --> 00:23:30.566
for developers and researchers

00:23:31.136 --> 00:23:32.926
to create apps for
medical research.

00:23:34.236 --> 00:23:39.016
ResearchKit now includes iPad
support, new active tasks

00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:41.456
for PureTone Audiometry
which is used

00:23:41.456 --> 00:23:44.036
to identify hearing
threshold levels

00:23:44.676 --> 00:23:47.116
and also a simple
reaction-time task

00:23:47.116 --> 00:23:49.406
to measure a user's
reaction time to an event.

00:23:49.406 --> 00:23:53.956
There is also a new image
capture step to use.

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:57.466
As you saw yesterday, we made
a number of changes to HomeKit.

00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:01.446
We now support detailed
change notifications.

00:24:01.966 --> 00:24:03.256
When a light gets turned on,

00:24:03.736 --> 00:24:08.726
you now get a specific
delegate message identifying the

00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:12.156
characteristic and the
accessory that changed.

00:24:12.156 --> 00:24:15.776
So, you may get the particular
light turning on instead

00:24:15.776 --> 00:24:18.736
of just the generic something in
your house changed notification.

00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:24.986
HomeKit also has four predefined
action sets when you wake

00:24:24.986 --> 00:24:27.926
up in the morning, when you
leave, when you arrive home,

00:24:27.926 --> 00:24:31.366
when you go to bed, and you
can implement standard actions

00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:31.776
with these.

00:24:31.816 --> 00:24:34.936
Things like turning off the
lights, locking the doors,

00:24:34.936 --> 00:24:36.406
making sure the garage
is closed.

00:24:36.526 --> 00:24:38.766
Things like that, all
without requiring any

00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:39.786
user configuration.

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:46.856
In iOS 8 you can create a
timer trigger to allow you

00:24:46.856 --> 00:24:48.516
to execute a scene
on a schedule.

00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:53.346
In iOS 9 you can now create
much more complicated triggers.

00:24:54.006 --> 00:24:56.056
For example, you know,
when this door is unlocked

00:24:56.056 --> 00:24:58.576
and this motion sensor
is detecting motion

00:24:58.656 --> 00:25:01.916
and it is 30 minutes
after sunset do something.

00:25:02.566 --> 00:25:07.616
Of course HomeKit is available
on the Watch and you can use it

00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:10.156
to control devices within your
home directly from your watch.

00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:15.976
Wi-fi enabled accessories can
now be accessed remotely even

00:25:15.976 --> 00:25:17.806
if you don't have an Apple TV.

00:25:18.866 --> 00:25:22.036
You will be able to
communicate with them directly

00:25:22.036 --> 00:25:22.836
through iCloud

00:25:22.976 --> 00:25:26.446
and bluetooth-enabled
accessories can be automatically

00:25:26.446 --> 00:25:27.666
bridged over Wi-Fi.

00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:31.486
Even if you are out of Bluetooth
range with an accessory,

00:25:31.486 --> 00:25:33.266
you can still control it.

00:25:33.816 --> 00:25:36.916
Finally, we've included
standard definitions of a number

00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:39.046
of new items within your house.

00:25:40.536 --> 00:25:46.866
For CloudKit, we have updated
the limits and the pricing

00:25:46.866 --> 00:25:50.336
for public databases but much
more exciting we have now

00:25:50.336 --> 00:25:52.896
offered CloudKit Web
Services to integrate

00:25:53.116 --> 00:25:54.536
with your web applications.

00:25:56.516 --> 00:25:58.956
[ Applause ]

00:25:59.456 --> 00:26:01.556
There are two sessions
discussing CloudKit this week:

00:26:02.296 --> 00:26:08.376
What's New in CloudKit and
CloudKit Tips and Tricks.

00:26:08.546 --> 00:26:10.266
So until now the UI document

00:26:10.266 --> 00:26:12.136
and action controller
would create copies

00:26:12.136 --> 00:26:14.086
of every document
sent to another app.

00:26:15.476 --> 00:26:18.316
Now, with open in
place, apps can request

00:26:18.316 --> 00:26:21.146
to open documents directly
if they're stored in iCloud.

00:26:22.286 --> 00:26:25.406
Adoption consists of adding
a key to your info.plist

00:26:25.816 --> 00:26:26.856
to declare conformance

00:26:26.856 --> 00:26:28.716
in implementing a
new delegate method

00:26:28.716 --> 00:26:29.926
to opening the document
directly.

00:26:29.926 --> 00:26:39.226
We'll discuss this at
Building Document-Based Apps.

00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:42.636
Now, many applications contain
resources that are not needed

00:26:42.636 --> 00:26:44.636
when a user first
starts your application,

00:26:45.866 --> 00:26:48.696
including every resource your
app might ever need makes your

00:26:48.696 --> 00:26:52.386
app bundle significantly larger,
slows down the installation

00:26:52.386 --> 00:26:54.476
and can even push you
over the OTA limit

00:26:54.476 --> 00:26:55.676
which can impact your sales.

00:26:57.406 --> 00:27:00.886
So to address this we're
introducing on-demand resources.

00:27:01.816 --> 00:27:04.726
Your application is uploaded
as single package exactly

00:27:04.726 --> 00:27:09.396
like you do today, but content
can be downloaded dynamically

00:27:09.396 --> 00:27:10.796
when the application needs it.

00:27:11.456 --> 00:27:15.366
These assets are intelligently
cached using heuristics based

00:27:15.366 --> 00:27:17.576
on your input as well
as user behavior.

00:27:19.586 --> 00:27:24.516
In Xcode, assets are grouped
together using simple tags

00:27:24.516 --> 00:27:28.476
and we're introducing a new
class called NS Bundle Resource

00:27:28.476 --> 00:27:30.856
Request that allows
you to request all

00:27:30.856 --> 00:27:32.466
of the resources
with a given tag.

00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:36.636
Once those resources have
downloaded you can use familiar

00:27:36.636 --> 00:27:39.826
API to access them, things
like UI Image, image named.

00:27:40.436 --> 00:27:44.476
There is even a way
to test this in Xcode

00:27:44.476 --> 00:27:47.556
to simulate not having the
resources and requesting them

00:27:47.556 --> 00:27:49.676
from the server, Xcode
will act as the server

00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:52.156
and deliver those resources
to your application.

00:27:53.326 --> 00:27:55.376
Now another new technology
we're introducing

00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:58.316
to address your application
size is app slicing.

00:27:59.406 --> 00:28:03.546
Now, applications often have
assets and executable content

00:28:03.576 --> 00:28:05.106
that aren't relevant
to the hardware

00:28:05.106 --> 00:28:07.016
that the user has
installed it in.

00:28:07.136 --> 00:28:11.056
This slicing takes care of
delivering just the resources

00:28:11.126 --> 00:28:14.536
and executable slices that
that user's device needs.

00:28:14.536 --> 00:28:18.976
Using app slicing the App Store
will generate automatically

00:28:19.076 --> 00:28:21.596
and deliver tailored
variants of your applications

00:28:21.596 --> 00:28:23.336
to all devices running iOS 9

00:28:23.336 --> 00:28:26.106
and these will only
contain the resources

00:28:26.106 --> 00:28:28.686
and executable slices
pertinent to that device.

00:28:30.466 --> 00:28:31.566
This happens on the server

00:28:31.566 --> 00:28:34.226
so the extraneous content
isn't even downloaded.

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:37.066
This saves installation time

00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:39.886
and can hopefully even bring
the app under the OTA limit.

00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:44.346
We're also introducing a
new NS data asset class

00:28:44.346 --> 00:28:48.056
which allows you to easily fetch
content tailored to the memory

00:28:48.056 --> 00:28:50.036
and graphics capability
of your device.

00:28:50.366 --> 00:28:54.426
Now for Game Center we have
added guest players which allows

00:28:54.426 --> 00:28:57.106
for new configurations in
Game Center multiplayer.

00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:01.926
We've also unified the Game
Center server environment

00:29:01.926 --> 00:29:05.796
to streamline development
and testing.

00:29:05.796 --> 00:29:07.716
Finally we're introducing
ReplayKit

00:29:07.896 --> 00:29:11.586
which provides a new way
to share game experiences.

00:29:12.856 --> 00:29:15.846
It allows your apps to easily
record audio and visuals

00:29:15.846 --> 00:29:17.966
and share them with other users.

00:29:20.146 --> 00:29:23.096
In iOS 9 SpriteKit
is now Metal-backed

00:29:23.096 --> 00:29:24.606
on systems that support it.

00:29:25.376 --> 00:29:28.056
It is open GL on systems
that don't support Metal.

00:29:28.486 --> 00:29:30.806
This happens automatically
without your involvement.

00:29:32.196 --> 00:29:34.426
There is also an all
new action editor

00:29:34.976 --> 00:29:37.966
and of course it is
integrated tightly

00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:39.666
with on demand resources.

00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:44.966
You can find out more at
What's New in SpriteKit.

00:29:46.836 --> 00:29:51.416
For SceneKit there is an
all-new scene editor available

00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:54.366
in Xcode 7 that supports
particles, physics,

00:29:54.676 --> 00:29:56.036
actions, and much more.

00:29:56.036 --> 00:29:59.866
There is also a ton of new
features in SceneKit itself.

00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:05.316
Things like scene transitions,
audio nodes, model i/o,

00:30:05.956 --> 00:30:12.956
ambient occlusion and light
maps and many other features.

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:15.956
Now while SpriteKit and SceneKit
are fantastic frameworks

00:30:15.956 --> 00:30:18.096
for building the graphical
interface for a game,

00:30:18.726 --> 00:30:23.476
there is far more to a great
game than just the graphics.

00:30:23.576 --> 00:30:27.246
Games have entities and
components, they have agents

00:30:27.446 --> 00:30:29.256
which are autonomous
objects within your game

00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:31.116
that have goals and behaviors.

00:30:31.436 --> 00:30:35.406
You need path-finding algorithms
to allow your agents to navigate

00:30:35.406 --> 00:30:39.996
around your game and you need
AI for allowing the agents

00:30:39.996 --> 00:30:44.076
to decide what moves
they're going to make.

00:30:44.286 --> 00:30:45.376
All of the elements you need

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:48.656
to build really engaging
gameplay can be found now

00:30:48.656 --> 00:30:50.946
in GameplayKit and
you can find out more

00:30:50.946 --> 00:30:52.246
at Introducing GameplayKit.

00:30:52.736 --> 00:30:55.646
Finally, of course, we're
introducing WatchOS 2.

00:30:56.246 --> 00:30:59.076
In addition to direct access
to existing frameworks,

00:30:59.206 --> 00:31:01.826
there is now new frameworks
such as Watch connectivity

00:31:02.236 --> 00:31:05.596
for connecting to your app
on the phone and WatchKit

00:31:05.596 --> 00:31:07.216
for building Watch
face complications.

00:31:10.006 --> 00:31:11.546
You can find out more
at Introducing WatchKit

00:31:11.576 --> 00:31:15.326
for WatchOS 2 for an overview of
all of the sessions this week,

00:31:15.886 --> 00:31:17.856
the Talk About WatchOS 2.

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:21.776
For more information, there is,
of course, the documentation,

00:31:22.546 --> 00:31:25.556
there is the online forums,
developer technical support.

00:31:26.856 --> 00:31:28.176
Thanks. I hope you
have a great week.
