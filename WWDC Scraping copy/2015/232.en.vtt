00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.226
>> VINCE SPADER: Hello.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.736
My name is Vince Spader.

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:36.876
I'm an engineer on
the Cocoa frameworks.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.436
And today I'm going
to be talking to you

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:41.536
about Best Practices
for Progress Reporting,

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:44.456
which in Cocoa means NSProgress.

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:48.656
So I'm going to give you an
introduction in NSProgress,

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:52.236
then we'll talk about composing
NSProgress objects together,

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:55.456
and then how to use
NSProgress as an interface

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:57.636
for cancellation,
pausing, and resuming.

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.756
Then we'll talk a little
bit about hooking NSProgress

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:03.326
up to your user interface,
and we'll wrap

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:05.146
up with some tips
and best practices.

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:07.686
So let's get started.

00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:12.106
NSProgress is an
object in Foundation

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:14.336
that represents the
completion of some work.

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:18.416
That work could be downloading
a file, installing an app,

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.546
or something your own
application is doing.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:26.406
The NSProgress object exists to
let you easily report progress

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:29.246
in your application
across various components,

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:31.486
both yours and the system's.

00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:36.246
In fact, several Cocoa APIs are
reporting their progress via

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:39.156
NSProgress, like
NSBundle Resource Request,

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.066
UIDocument, and NSData.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.256
So you can use NSProgress
to get information

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.976
about what those APIs are
doing in your application.

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:50.726
And NSProgress is localized.

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:53.166
You can use it to show
information to the user

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.196
about what's happening.

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:56.936
And we have ways to
influence what it says,

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:57.876
which we'll get to soon.

00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:03.056
But first, these are the core
properties on NSProgress.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.026
We have the totalUnitCount,
which is how much work there is

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.186
to do, and the
completedUnitCount,

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.576
which is how much work
has been completed.

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:12.756
And that gets updated
as the work occurs.

00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:18.436
And the fractionCompleted is a
double that gets updated from 0

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:21.756
to 1, letting you know how
far along the work is toward

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:22.366
being completed.

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:26.806
So, totalUnitCount and
completedUnitCount,

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.436
the unit these properties are
referring to is up to you.

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:32.366
It is whatever unit
it makes sense

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.866
to track in terms of progress.

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:38.626
Perhaps bytes, number of files,
photos, or even abstract units

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:41.106
like percentage points
or fractions of work.

00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:44.726
Each individual NSProgress
object has its own idea

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:48.176
of what unit it is reporting in.

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.176
And if you don't know how
much work there is total,

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:52.906
so you don't know
your totalUnitCount,

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:55.166
you can make your
progress indeterminant.

00:02:55.206 --> 00:02:58.406
And you do that by either
setting the completedUnitCount

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.986
or the totalUnitCount
to a negative value.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:04.896
Next, let's talk
about localization.

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:09.016
NSProgress has two properties,
localized Description

00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:10.656
and localized Additional
Description,

00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:12.316
that you can display
to the user.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.436
You can set them yourself
but NSProgress will also come

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:18.126
up with something
for you by default.

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:22.626
So, here is an example of the
default localized Description

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:24.146
and localized Additional
Description.

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:27.706
We have an NSProgress with a
totalUnitCount of 5 million

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.176
and some, and a
completedUnitCount

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.266
of 419 thousand and change.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:36.116
The default localized
Description is 7 percent

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:39.276
completed, and the localized
Additional Description formats

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:40.596
those numbers nicely.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:43.396
So this is the default.

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:45.026
And if you want something
different,

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:46.956
you could set the
localized Description

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:48.896
and localized Additional
Description yourself

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:51.716
but then you would need
to actually localize it

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:53.486
in the languages
your app supports.

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:57.196
And instead of doing that,
we have a couple of knobs

00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:59.316
that you can use to
alter those defaults.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.686
So the first is through
the kind property.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:05.516
Currently the only option is
for files, NSProgressKindFile.

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:08.506
Using this means
your units are bytes,

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:10.866
so when NSProgress knows
your units are bytes,

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.586
it can format them as such,

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:17.055
so you see now it can say 419
kilobytes of 5.3 megabytes.

00:04:17.776 --> 00:04:22.246
The other knob for changing the
default localized Descriptions

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:24.716
is through certain keys in
the user info dictionary.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:29.276
So NSProgress has a user info
dictionary, there is a method,

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:32.186
Set User Info Object For
Key, that lets you set a key

00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:33.776
and value in the userInfo.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:37.236
And one key that's useful
for virtually any kind

00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:40.886
of NSProgress is NSProgress
Estimated Time Remaining Key.

00:04:41.236 --> 00:04:43.236
The value there is an NSNumber

00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:44.746
of how many seconds
are remaining

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:45.856
until the work is completed.

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:50.516
And you can see if we set
that to, say, 97 seconds,

00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:52.556
our localized Additional
Description now includes

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:56.266
that information formatted as
1 minute, 37 seconds remaining.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:00.946
And there are additional
userInfo keys that are only used

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:02.306
if your kind is set to file.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.626
First let's look at NSProgress
File Operation Kind Key.

00:05:06.986 --> 00:05:09.326
This tells NSProgress
the type of operation

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:10.956
that is being performed
on the file.

00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:14.136
The values are either
downloading, decompressing,

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:19.216
receiving, or copying, so if
you set the File Operation Kind

00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:22.006
to NSProgress File
Operation Kind Downloading,

00:05:22.376 --> 00:05:23.986
that updates the
localized Description

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:25.636
to say it is downloading files.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:30.706
Another key available when your
Kind is File is the NSProgress

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:31.676
File URL Key.

00:05:32.086 --> 00:05:34.896
And that is an NSURL of
the file being worked on.

00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:36.376
So when you set that,

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:38.766
the localized Description will
include the name of the file,

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:42.106
in this example, photos.zip,
which is from the given URL.

00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:45.156
There are also options

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:47.676
for if you're operating
on a set of files.

00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:50.926
NSProgress File Total Count
Key and Completed Count Key.

00:05:51.386 --> 00:05:52.616
So, here's an example

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:54.986
where we're setting the
File Completed Count to 7,

00:05:54.986 --> 00:05:56.596
and the File Total Count to 9,

00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:59.706
and the localized Description
might use that information,

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:01.816
so now it says, downloading
9 files.

00:06:02.916 --> 00:06:06.316
Note that the kind is still File
and the units are still bytes,

00:06:06.316 --> 00:06:09.236
it is just the total bytes
of the files being worked on.

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:13.716
And finally, we have the
NSProgress Throughput Key.

00:06:14.136 --> 00:06:15.996
And that's the bytes-per-second

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:18.286
that the file operations
are being performed at.

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:19.536
So, say, it is downloading

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:22.306
at a blazing fast
50,000 bytes-per-second,

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.896
if we set the throughput
on the userInfo,

00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:27.316
the NSProgress can
include that information

00:06:27.316 --> 00:06:29.366
in the localized
Description, so it says,

00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:30.636
50 kilobytes-per-second.

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:34.036
So, all these options
can really provide,

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:37.136
help you provide more
information to the user

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:40.076
about what's happening.,
without you having

00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:41.156
to localize it yourself.

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:45.306
Now, before we go any
further, we need to talk

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:46.326
about responsibilities.

00:06:47.576 --> 00:06:49.336
There are two sides
of NSProgress,

00:06:49.336 --> 00:06:52.396
there is the creation side of
it, and the client side of it.

00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:54.176
First the creation side.

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:58.976
So, when you create an
NSProgress, you are responsible

00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:00.446
for setting its properties

00:07:00.526 --> 00:07:02.226
and updating the
completedUnitCount

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:03.246
as the work finishes.

00:07:03.786 --> 00:07:06.316
So you're creating it, you're
setting the totalUnitCount,

00:07:06.546 --> 00:07:09.266
the Kind, setting
keys in the userInfo,

00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:11.346
and updating the
completedUnitCount

00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:12.336
as the work finishes.

00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:16.376
On the other hand, if
you receive an NSProgress

00:07:16.376 --> 00:07:18.076
from someone else,
you're the client.

00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:20.406
You can get and observe
the various properties,

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.556
the totalUnitCount and
completedUnitCount,

00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:25.496
the fractionCompleted, or
those localizedDescriptions,

00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:27.686
but do not go setting
those properties

00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:29.696
because that's just
going to cause confusion

00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:31.286
with the creator
of the NSProgress.

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:36.496
So when you create an
NSProgress, you need a way

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:39.086
to give it to clients, and when
you're a client you need a way

00:07:39.086 --> 00:07:39.466
to get it.

00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:41.426
And one way of doing this is

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:44.566
through the NSProgress reporting
protocol, which we added

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:47.226
in OS X 10.11 and iOS 9.

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:50.986
It is pretty simple, and it
defines one property, progress.

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:54.056
In Cocoa UIDocument

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:56.476
and NSBundleResourceRequest,
both implement this.

00:07:56.936 --> 00:07:58.566
And it makes it really obvious

00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:01.336
that a class supports
progress reporting.

00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:03.206
All right.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:07.746
Now, let's do a demo and
take a look at some code.

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:09.846
So, here we have an app.

00:08:10.176 --> 00:08:11.206
It is pretty basic.

00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:15.306
It has a photo, and you hit this
import button and it downloads

00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:18.636
that photo, and when
the download finishes,

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:21.026
it shows it to the user.

00:08:21.746 --> 00:08:24.066
Now, that's a pretty
awful user experience,

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:26.396
the user has basically
no idea what's happening.

00:08:26.816 --> 00:08:28.846
And we can make it better
by reporting progress

00:08:28.846 --> 00:08:30.356
to the user for our download.

00:08:30.656 --> 00:08:37.096
So, if we go to our project,
we have our download class

00:08:37.436 --> 00:08:43.775
that is used to download the
photo, and it has an initializer

00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:46.136
that takes a URL
for it to download,

00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:48.926
and it has a completion
handler that gets called

00:08:48.926 --> 00:08:51.816
with the downloaded data or
an error if an error occurs.

00:08:52.286 --> 00:08:57.136
Next there is a start
method which gets --

00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:00.646
which kicks the whole download
off, and we have a handful

00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:03.956
of private methods for various
download-related functionality.

00:09:05.436 --> 00:09:10.476
And we also have these
convenience methods

00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:12.866
that will get called as
the download progresses.

00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:18.616
So we have Will Begin
Download, which gets called

00:09:18.616 --> 00:09:19.716
when the download begins

00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:21.716
and it gets the total
length of the download.

00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:25.646
Did Download Data, which
gets called periodically

00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:27.396
as the download completes.

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:32.516
Did Finish Download gets called
when the download is completed,

00:09:32.746 --> 00:09:35.136
and Did Fail To Download
is called

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:36.756
if there was an error
during the download.

00:09:37.736 --> 00:09:39.946
So what we're going to do is
we want to report progress

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:43.126
about this download
operation, and we can do

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:45.666
that by adopting the
NSProgressReporting protocol.

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:49.806
So let's go ahead and go up
to our class declaration,

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:52.496
and we can add
NSProgressReporting

00:09:52.646 --> 00:09:54.356
to our list of classes.

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:59.286
And in order to conform
to NSProgressReporting,

00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:02.016
we need a ProgressProperty.

00:10:02.266 --> 00:10:04.436
So let's add that,
it's in NSProgress.

00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:06.836
And now in our initializer
we need

00:10:06.836 --> 00:10:08.596
to create our NSProgressObject.

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:14.836
And since we don't know how
much there is to download yet,

00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:16.926
we're going to make our
progress indeterminant.

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:19.576
And one way of making your
progress indeterminant is

00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:23.386
setting the totalUnitCount to a
negative value, so we're going

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:25.186
to set our totalUnitCount
to negative 1.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.316
And since we know we're
downloading a file here,

00:10:28.726 --> 00:10:33.116
we can also give the NSProgress
a little bit more information

00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:33.886
about what's happening.

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:37.726
So we can set the Kind
to NSProgress Kind File,

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.866
and we can set in the userInfo,

00:10:40.866 --> 00:10:44.416
the NSProgress File Operation
Kind Key to Downloading.

00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:48.546
So now we have created our
NSProgress and now we just need

00:10:48.546 --> 00:10:50.856
to update it as the
download completes.

00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.726
So, back to our Will
Begin Download method,

00:10:53.726 --> 00:10:58.136
that gets the total
amount to download.

00:10:58.136 --> 00:11:01.146
So we want to set our
totalUnitCount to that amount.

00:11:01.676 --> 00:11:04.606
And at that point the progress
will no longer be indeterminant.

00:11:04.606 --> 00:11:07.686
And in our Did Download
Data callback,

00:11:07.686 --> 00:11:11.806
which is called periodically, we
can set our completedUnitCount

00:11:12.016 --> 00:11:14.326
to the number of bytes
downloaded so far.

00:11:15.136 --> 00:11:18.006
And finally, in our Did
Download Data callback,

00:11:18.876 --> 00:11:20.676
we can set our
completedUnitCount

00:11:20.676 --> 00:11:22.876
to the total number of
bytes in the download,

00:11:23.306 --> 00:11:24.996
and that way the
progress will be finished.

00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:29.636
Now if we, now the user
interface is already using

00:11:29.686 --> 00:11:33.386
NSProgressReporting and
looking for the download

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:37.036
to implement that, and will show
the progress, so when we build

00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:42.406
and run our app, and we
press the import button,

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:45.286
we have a progress being
reported for the download

00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:48.336
to the user, and it is a
much less painful experience.

00:11:49.536 --> 00:11:49.886
All right.

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:51.366
So, back to slides.

00:11:52.516 --> 00:11:54.566
[Applause]

00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:55.286
>> VINCE SPADER: All right.

00:11:55.576 --> 00:11:57.636
So, that's the basics
of NSProgress.

00:11:57.636 --> 00:12:00.716
Now let's get into what really
makes NSProgress powerful,

00:12:00.716 --> 00:12:03.226
which is the ability to
compose progress objects

00:12:03.226 --> 00:12:04.986
into other progress objects.

00:12:06.276 --> 00:12:08.976
Now, just because I press a
download button doesn't mean

00:12:08.976 --> 00:12:10.706
that there is really
only one thing happening.

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:13.276
There might be the
download, a verify,

00:12:13.276 --> 00:12:16.336
and a decompress operation all
running in reporting progress.

00:12:16.826 --> 00:12:19.676
But the user only
sees one progress bar.

00:12:20.646 --> 00:12:23.816
So, let's say that these
boxes represent individual

00:12:23.856 --> 00:12:24.856
NSProgress objects.

00:12:25.336 --> 00:12:28.216
They each report their own
progress in their own units

00:12:28.216 --> 00:12:29.886
without having to
worry about the others.

00:12:30.356 --> 00:12:33.326
But we want them to be combined
into a single NSProgress

00:12:33.716 --> 00:12:36.226
that we hook up to
the user interface.

00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:38.966
So we're going to create
an NSProgress object

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:40.476
and call it the overall
progress.

00:12:41.246 --> 00:12:43.666
And we can compose
these other progresses

00:12:43.666 --> 00:12:45.166
into our overall progress,

00:12:45.626 --> 00:12:47.426
the overall progress
becomes a parent

00:12:47.426 --> 00:12:50.416
of these other three progress
objects, the download, verify,

00:12:50.416 --> 00:12:53.156
and decompress progresses
are its children.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.656
And as those children complete,

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:58.946
the overall progress
will be updated.

00:12:59.076 --> 00:13:01.926
So for composing NSProgress
objects, we have this idea

00:13:01.926 --> 00:13:03.116
of a pendingUnitCount.

00:13:03.526 --> 00:13:05.516
The pendingUnitCount
is a portion

00:13:05.516 --> 00:13:08.456
of the parent's totalUnitCount
that gets assigned

00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:10.546
to a child progress object.

00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:13.846
The pendingUnitCount is in
terms of the parent's units,

00:13:14.106 --> 00:13:15.556
the child has its own units,

00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:18.756
and we say that the parent's
pendingUnitCount is assigned

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:21.456
to the child.

00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:24.916
So what happens is, when
a child progress finishes,

00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:27.666
the parent's completedUnitCount
is incremented

00:13:27.666 --> 00:13:29.976
by the pendingUnitCount
for that child.

00:13:30.396 --> 00:13:31.726
So when you have a child,

00:13:32.276 --> 00:13:34.736
you don't update the
completedUnitCount manually,

00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:37.246
that might conflict with
an update that happens

00:13:37.246 --> 00:13:38.466
when your child finishes.

00:13:38.926 --> 00:13:41.176
When your at parent
progress, you really want

00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:43.486
to assign your entire
totalUnitCount to children.

00:13:44.066 --> 00:13:47.126
So let's go over a
diagram of composition.

00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:49.206
Let's say we're importing
some photos.

00:13:49.566 --> 00:13:52.556
So we have the overall
import NSProgress object.

00:13:53.496 --> 00:13:56.446
There are two photos
total, so the totalUnitCount

00:13:56.846 --> 00:13:58.456
for our import progress is 2.

00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:01.926
And it is going to assign
its entire totalUnitCount

00:14:01.926 --> 00:14:03.666
to its children, which
are the progresses

00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:05.286
for the individual photos below.

00:14:05.756 --> 00:14:09.186
So each photo is assigned a
pendingUnitCount of 1 photo

00:14:09.186 --> 00:14:11.166
from the overall
import progress.

00:14:11.766 --> 00:14:15.576
Now, the individual photo
progresses are similar

00:14:15.576 --> 00:14:16.726
but their unit is different,

00:14:16.726 --> 00:14:18.826
they have a totalUnitCount
of two steps.

00:14:19.746 --> 00:14:22.306
And each step is taking
up one pendingUnitCount,

00:14:22.306 --> 00:14:24.516
one for the download
and one for the filter.

00:14:25.456 --> 00:14:28.236
And finally we have the
download and filter progresses.

00:14:28.716 --> 00:14:30.066
They have their own units.

00:14:30.456 --> 00:14:31.756
They have no children.

00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:34.466
And they update their
completedUnitCount manually.

00:14:36.256 --> 00:14:36.906
All right.

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:39.566
So I brought in the
completedUnitCounts here.

00:14:39.566 --> 00:14:40.886
That's the zero of.

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:44.646
And the fraction completed is
the percentage at the bottom.

00:14:44.646 --> 00:14:46.646
Since we haven't done anything
yet, it starts at zero.

00:14:46.646 --> 00:14:49.716
And let's see what happens
as the completedUnitCounts

00:14:49.716 --> 00:14:50.956
at the bottom are updated.

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:55.566
So you can see these -- as
these children complete,

00:14:56.036 --> 00:14:58.386
the fraction completed is
updating in the parents.

00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:00.736
Progress kind of flows
up to the parent.

00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:03.016
And note that the
completedUnitCount

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:05.526
for the overall progress
is still zero.

00:15:05.846 --> 00:15:08.866
The completedUnitCount is only
incremented once the child is

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:11.686
finished and photo 1
still isn't finished.

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:15.486
And once a child does finish,

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:17.156
the completedUnitCount
is incremented

00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:19.066
by the pendingUnitCount
for the child.

00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:23.516
You can see that the import
progress now has one photo

00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:26.406
complete since photo one
is now 100% finished.

00:15:27.776 --> 00:15:31.296
The fraction completed, on
the other hand, is multiplying

00:15:31.296 --> 00:15:33.036
up based on the pendingUnitCount

00:15:33.346 --> 00:15:35.226
and the fraction
completed of the child.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:38.576
It doesn't wait until the
child is finished to update.

00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:44.376
And when everything is at 100%,
the import progress is finished,

00:15:45.016 --> 00:15:47.226
and that's an example
of what happens

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:49.646
when you're composing
NSProgress objects.

00:15:51.006 --> 00:15:52.266
Now let's zoom in here.

00:15:52.836 --> 00:15:56.086
Here we have a progress for
an individual photo's import,

00:15:56.086 --> 00:15:57.506
so this is just one photo.

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:00.746
There are the two steps,
download and filter.

00:16:00.746 --> 00:16:02.766
So we have a totalUnitCount
of 2.

00:16:03.176 --> 00:16:05.616
And we say the download is
going to take one of those units

00:16:05.616 --> 00:16:07.576
and the filter is going to
take one of those units.

00:16:08.276 --> 00:16:12.836
So each step takes up half of
the photo's overall progress.

00:16:13.596 --> 00:16:15.776
But what if these
operations aren't equal?

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:18.856
What if we know that the
filter is pretty quick relative

00:16:18.856 --> 00:16:22.416
to the time to download, so it
looks something more like this?

00:16:23.586 --> 00:16:25.526
Well, units can be arbitrary.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.986
You can say that there
are actually ten steps

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:29.826
and the download is
assigned nine of those,

00:16:29.936 --> 00:16:31.126
and the filter is assigned one.

00:16:31.886 --> 00:16:33.836
And now as the download
completes,

00:16:34.406 --> 00:16:37.716
the download step takes up
90% of the import progress

00:16:37.816 --> 00:16:39.786
and the filter takes
the remaining 10%.

00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:43.706
So you can modify the units
of the progress in order

00:16:43.706 --> 00:16:45.516
to weight the work being
assigned to children.

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:46.106
All right.

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:50.436
Let's see how to
actually do this in code.

00:16:50.436 --> 00:16:54.676
There are two ways of
composing NSProgress objects

00:16:55.016 --> 00:16:56.226
and the first way
I'm going to talk

00:16:56.226 --> 00:16:57.826
about is implicit composition.

00:16:58.556 --> 00:17:02.296
So you create a parent
progress object.

00:17:02.676 --> 00:17:05.076
This will be the
photoProgress from before.

00:17:05.856 --> 00:17:07.886
So there are two steps.

00:17:08.425 --> 00:17:12.826
And we have -- so we have
a totalUnitCount of 2.

00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:16.915
And what we want to do, is add
a download progress as a child.

00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:20.046
So we call become Current
With Pending Unit Count

00:17:20.046 --> 00:17:22.156
on the parent progress,
the photoProgress.

00:17:22.915 --> 00:17:26.965
And what this does is it sets
a thread local current progress

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:30.086
so the photoProgress is
the current progress,

00:17:30.546 --> 00:17:33.466
and that pendingUnitCount
of 1 is set aside

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:37.616
and basically reserved
for progress to come along

00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:39.756
and get added to the
current progress.

00:17:40.396 --> 00:17:46.706
And next we call our download
function, startDownload,

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:50.296
and that creates a
progress with the NSProgress

00:17:50.296 --> 00:17:52.386
with totalUnitCount
convenience constructor,

00:17:52.856 --> 00:17:55.936
and with totalUnit
convenience constructor,

00:17:56.356 --> 00:17:59.836
we'll add the created progress
to the current progress.

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:05.296
So the download is added as
a child of our photoProgress.

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:08.266
Next we need to clean this up.

00:18:08.376 --> 00:18:09.756
So we call resigned current

00:18:10.106 --> 00:18:13.646
and the photoProgress is no
longer the current progress.

00:18:13.706 --> 00:18:15.766
And that's it.

00:18:16.276 --> 00:18:18.716
Now we've used implicit
composition

00:18:18.876 --> 00:18:23.306
to add a child to a parent.

00:18:23.306 --> 00:18:25.916
A few things to remember when
using implicit composition,

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:28.906
when supporting implicit
composition,

00:18:29.926 --> 00:18:35.366
you want to create the
NSProgress immediately using the

00:18:35.366 --> 00:18:37.306
with totalUnitCount
convenience constructor.

00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:40.436
That's because the first
progress object added

00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:43.886
to the current progress takes
up that entire pendingUnitCount.

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:47.396
And if you create it first
thing, you don't have to worry

00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:50.096
about getters or other
calls unintentionally taking

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:51.436
up the parent's
pendingUnitCount.

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.426
Also, be sure to document it.

00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:57.076
Implicit composition
is implicit after all,

00:18:57.476 --> 00:19:00.406
clients won't know you support
implicit composition unless you

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:03.176
say so.

00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:05.756
Also, if no child is added

00:19:05.756 --> 00:19:07.436
by the time you call
resigned current,

00:19:08.156 --> 00:19:10.806
that pendingUnitCount
will be immediately added

00:19:10.806 --> 00:19:12.596
to the parent's
completedUnitCount.

00:19:13.256 --> 00:19:15.016
So your completedUnitCount
will be updated.

00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:20.996
So, the second way to compose
NSProgress objects is new

00:19:20.996 --> 00:19:23.376
in OS X 10.11 and iOS 9,

00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:25.466
and that's called
explicit composition.

00:19:26.186 --> 00:19:29.696
So, you receive a progress
that you want to add

00:19:29.696 --> 00:19:31.076
as a child from somewhere.

00:19:31.076 --> 00:19:32.506
Perhaps something that conforms

00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:34.626
to the NSProgressReporting,
we'll say a filter.

00:19:35.826 --> 00:19:37.236
And you have your
parent progress

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:38.296
that you want to add it to.

00:19:38.906 --> 00:19:41.666
Let's say the photoProgress
from before.

00:19:43.156 --> 00:19:47.116
Then you simply call
addChild with pendingUnitCount

00:19:47.746 --> 00:19:51.646
on the progress you
want to add it to,

00:19:51.776 --> 00:19:55.176
and path in your child progress,
the filterProgress, here,

00:19:55.646 --> 00:19:57.736
and give it the pendingUnitCount
you want to add it with,

00:19:57.736 --> 00:20:00.716
since it is one step, we want to
add it with a pendingCount of 1.

00:20:01.596 --> 00:20:02.306
And that's it.

00:20:02.486 --> 00:20:06.286
Now your progress is a child
of the parent progress.

00:20:06.286 --> 00:20:11.856
So here are some guidelines
for when to use explicit

00:20:11.856 --> 00:20:13.266
or implicit composition.

00:20:13.876 --> 00:20:17.356
If you have a method that
can't return in NSProgress

00:20:17.526 --> 00:20:20.316
like you're crossing an API
boundary you can't change,

00:20:20.656 --> 00:20:22.576
use implicit composition
and document

00:20:22.576 --> 00:20:24.086
that it supports
implicit composition.

00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:29.876
Or, because explicit composition
is new in OS X 10.11 and iOS 9,

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:33.316
you'll have to use implicit
composition on older releases.

00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:35.726
Otherwise, you will
generally want

00:20:35.726 --> 00:20:38.046
to use explicit composition;
it is a lot simpler.

00:20:38.046 --> 00:20:38.726
All right.

00:20:40.216 --> 00:20:45.566
Now let's go through
a demo of composition.

00:20:45.566 --> 00:20:48.586
So here we have our
photo download class

00:20:48.626 --> 00:20:51.836
that we added our progress
reporting to last time.

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:55.686
And if we run our app, it
has been changed a bit.

00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:57.826
Now it has a CollectionView

00:20:57.826 --> 00:21:00.586
of photos instead
of a single photo.

00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:03.246
So, and when we press import,

00:21:03.676 --> 00:21:05.846
instead of just downloading
those images,

00:21:06.136 --> 00:21:07.976
it is also running
them through a filter.

00:21:08.456 --> 00:21:10.126
So we don't have
progress information

00:21:10.126 --> 00:21:13.506
for that overall thing, so
the experience is pretty bad.

00:21:14.366 --> 00:21:16.076
And again, we can make it better

00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:19.736
by having our operations
report progress.

00:21:20.816 --> 00:21:21.726
So let's do that.

00:21:22.996 --> 00:21:24.296
So we have our download class

00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:25.866
that supports
NSProgressReporting,

00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:30.096
and we have our filter class,
which has a class method

00:21:30.096 --> 00:21:32.366
that takes an image and
returns a filtered image.

00:21:33.836 --> 00:21:38.206
And we have this import class,
which has both the download

00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:41.116
and runs the filter when
the download completes.

00:21:41.486 --> 00:21:43.086
So it combines the
progress for --

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:51.406
we want it to combine the
progress for the download

00:21:51.736 --> 00:21:53.106
and the filter operation.

00:21:54.556 --> 00:21:57.666
So let's look at
our photo import.

00:21:57.666 --> 00:21:59.866
It has an initializer,
which takes a URL

00:22:00.436 --> 00:22:03.726
and it creates the
download with that URL.

00:22:04.436 --> 00:22:07.876
It also has a completion
handler that gets called

00:22:07.876 --> 00:22:10.396
with the filtered
and downloaded image,

00:22:10.456 --> 00:22:11.856
or an error if an error occurs.

00:22:12.786 --> 00:22:15.686
And it also has a start method
for starting the import.

00:22:15.976 --> 00:22:19.756
And the start method sets
the completion handler

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:23.236
on the download, and
then creates a UIImage

00:22:23.306 --> 00:22:28.736
from the downloaded data,
and then passes that image

00:22:28.736 --> 00:22:30.916
into our filter, getting
out our filtered image,

00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:33.066
and then calls its
own completion handler

00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:34.146
with the filtered image.

00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:37.536
And once the completion handler
is set, it starts the download.

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:43.066
So what we want to do is have
our photo import report a

00:22:43.066 --> 00:22:46.256
combined progress comprising
of both the download

00:22:46.256 --> 00:22:47.576
and the filter's progress.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.246
And we are going
to do that again

00:22:49.366 --> 00:22:53.696
by having our photo import class
conform to NSProgressReporting.

00:22:54.296 --> 00:22:56.496
So let's go up to
our class declaration

00:22:57.086 --> 00:22:58.566
and add NSProgressReporting.

00:23:00.096 --> 00:23:04.216
Now we need to have a progress
property, so let's add that.

00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:07.446
ANd we need to create
our NSProgress object.

00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:10.546
And this time for
our units we're going

00:23:10.546 --> 00:23:12.166
to use something
a little abstract.

00:23:12.286 --> 00:23:14.546
We have run the app a
few times and we've found

00:23:14.546 --> 00:23:17.276
that if we have the
download take up about 90%

00:23:17.276 --> 00:23:19.846
of the import's progress,
that feels pretty good.

00:23:20.386 --> 00:23:22.346
So we're going to have
a totalUnitCount of 10,

00:23:22.686 --> 00:23:24.936
and we're going to say
the download takes up 9

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.916
of that totalUnitCount
and the filter is going

00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:27.926
to take up the remaining 1.

00:23:28.506 --> 00:23:31.146
So now in our start method,

00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:37.596
since the download already
conforms to NSProgressReporting,

00:23:37.886 --> 00:23:40.826
we can just get the progress
object from it and add it

00:23:40.826 --> 00:23:42.656
to our progress, and we can do

00:23:42.656 --> 00:23:44.756
that with the explicit
add child method.

00:23:45.286 --> 00:23:48.136
So we're calling progress
add child download progress,

00:23:48.306 --> 00:23:51.066
and our pendingUnitCount is 9,

00:23:51.126 --> 00:23:53.216
so it takes up 90%
of our progress.

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:57.656
And now we want to also
add the filter's progress

00:23:57.746 --> 00:23:58.656
to our progress.

00:23:59.376 --> 00:24:01.536
But the filter is a class method

00:24:01.536 --> 00:24:03.756
that takes an image
and returns an image.

00:24:03.856 --> 00:24:06.246
There is no obvious way to
get a progress out of it.

00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:11.646
But, if we go to our
photo filter class,

00:24:11.646 --> 00:24:12.986
we can see a comment here

00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:15.706
that says it supports
implicit progress composition.

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:18.336
So we can use implicit
progress composition

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:19.816
to add it as a child.

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:23.356
So let's go back to our
import start method.

00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:28.606
And in the downloads completion
handler, which might be called

00:24:28.606 --> 00:24:32.566
on a background thread,
we're going to become current

00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:34.826
with the pendingUnitCount of 1.

00:24:35.436 --> 00:24:39.706
And note, like I said,
the completion handler

00:24:39.706 --> 00:24:41.646
for the download might be
called in a background thread,

00:24:41.896 --> 00:24:44.876
but that's okay because we're
calling the filter immediately

00:24:44.876 --> 00:24:46.056
after on the same thread.

00:24:47.006 --> 00:24:52.146
So, after we become
current, our filter will run

00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:55.696
and it will add itself as a
child to the current progress,

00:24:56.606 --> 00:24:58.166
and once it returns, we need

00:24:58.166 --> 00:25:00.226
to no longer be the current
progress, so we're going

00:25:00.226 --> 00:25:01.176
to call resign current.

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:04.246
And that's it.

00:25:04.246 --> 00:25:07.376
Now we have added both the
download and the filter progress

00:25:07.426 --> 00:25:08.596
to our import progress.

00:25:09.186 --> 00:25:18.026
And now if we run our
app, and we press import,

00:25:18.336 --> 00:25:21.606
you can see the imports
are reporting progress

00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:22.386
for each photo.

00:25:23.266 --> 00:25:25.306
And that's good, the
user has more information

00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:27.736
on what's going on, but it
is not really that great.

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:30.266
We only want one progress
to show to the user.

00:25:30.736 --> 00:25:33.826
So let's do that.

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:37.196
So we're going to zoom out a
little bit and we're going to go

00:25:37.196 --> 00:25:39.876
to our root View Controller,
photos View Controller,

00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:43.366
and this has an overall
progress property.

00:25:43.656 --> 00:25:47.576
It is a client of this
NSProgress, it just gets it,

00:25:47.576 --> 00:25:49.696
and it is going to hook it
up to the UI and show it.

00:25:49.696 --> 00:25:51.846
It is not going to
create it itself.

00:25:53.206 --> 00:25:55.626
And it also has a
reference to an Album,

00:25:55.626 --> 00:25:57.626
which is the collection of
photos that we're downloading.

00:25:57.626 --> 00:26:02.156
And it has IBActions
for the toolbar buttons,

00:26:02.156 --> 00:26:03.866
in this case the
start import button

00:26:04.236 --> 00:26:08.676
and that IBAction just calls
import photos on our album.

00:26:09.646 --> 00:26:14.576
So if we look at our album
it has an array of photos,

00:26:15.556 --> 00:26:21.166
and it creates the photos
from URLs in the main bundle,

00:26:21.726 --> 00:26:27.256
and in its import photos method
it goes through each photo

00:26:27.516 --> 00:26:29.216
and calls start import on them.

00:26:29.786 --> 00:26:35.476
Now if we look at our photo,
our photo has an image URL

00:26:35.476 --> 00:26:37.716
that it gets in its initializer,

00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:42.306
and it also has a UIImage
property that starts

00:26:42.306 --> 00:26:43.596
out as a place holder.

00:26:44.606 --> 00:26:46.896
It also has its start
import method

00:26:46.896 --> 00:26:48.416
that is getting called
by the album.

00:26:48.706 --> 00:26:50.696
It creates that photo
import class

00:26:50.926 --> 00:26:53.056
that we added
NSProgressReporting to,

00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:55.646
and then sets a completion
handler

00:26:55.646 --> 00:26:58.956
for that photo import
class, to set the image

00:26:58.956 --> 00:27:00.416
as the image that's
been imported.

00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:03.926
And it is then, after the
completion handler is set,

00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:09.146
it starts the import and stashes
it away in case it needs it.

00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:11.286
So what we want to do is we want

00:27:11.286 --> 00:27:15.126
to get the photo imports
progress and collect them

00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:18.146
into a progress for all of the
imports that are happening.

00:27:19.496 --> 00:27:21.456
So let's go back up to
our root View Controller.

00:27:21.456 --> 00:27:24.166
And what we can do is we can say

00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:28.316
that our import progress
method returns that NSProgress.

00:27:28.896 --> 00:27:31.576
so we're going to set our
overall progress property

00:27:31.576 --> 00:27:33.376
to that returned NSProgress.

00:27:34.686 --> 00:27:37.246
And import photos doesn't
return in NSProgress yet,

00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:38.456
so we need to go do that.

00:27:38.986 --> 00:27:42.926
So let's go to our album and
its import photos method.

00:27:43.646 --> 00:27:45.476
And it is currently
returning void.

00:27:45.476 --> 00:27:48.126
And we need to make it
return in NSProgress.

00:27:48.866 --> 00:27:51.786
Then we need to create
the progress object

00:27:51.786 --> 00:27:52.836
that we're going to return.

00:27:53.766 --> 00:27:56.766
And since this progress object
is going to have a child

00:27:56.766 --> 00:28:01.486
for every photo in our album,
we want our totalUnitCount

00:28:01.876 --> 00:28:06.106
to be the number of
photos in the album.

00:28:06.106 --> 00:28:08.536
And also let's go
ahead and return it.

00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:11.646
And what we're going
to do is we're going

00:28:11.646 --> 00:28:15.506
to have our photo start import
method also return a progress,

00:28:16.836 --> 00:28:17.656
so we're just going to assign

00:28:17.656 --> 00:28:19.966
that to a local variable
import progress.

00:28:20.356 --> 00:28:23.726
And then we're going to add
that as a child to our --

00:28:24.046 --> 00:28:26.656
to the album's progress with
the pendingUnitCount of 1,

00:28:26.656 --> 00:28:29.946
since this is the import
progress for one photo.

00:28:30.466 --> 00:28:36.356
And now, in our photos
start import method,

00:28:36.356 --> 00:28:38.186
it is currently returning void.

00:28:38.406 --> 00:28:40.796
We want in to return in
NSProgress, so let's do that.

00:28:41.646 --> 00:28:45.276
And since our photo
import already conforms

00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:46.256
to NSProgressReporting,

00:28:46.526 --> 00:28:48.936
we can just return the
progress property from it.

00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:51.726
And that's it.

00:28:51.726 --> 00:28:53.846
We have quite a composition
happening now.

00:28:53.846 --> 00:28:56.056
We have that overall
progress being assigned

00:28:56.436 --> 00:28:58.316
to a progress made up --

00:28:58.316 --> 00:29:01.066
that has children for each
import that's happening,

00:29:01.386 --> 00:29:03.906
and each of those imports
has both a download

00:29:03.906 --> 00:29:04.816
and a filter child.

00:29:05.536 --> 00:29:10.626
So let's run the app.

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:13.806
And now we have an overall
progress at the bottom

00:29:13.806 --> 00:29:16.086
that gets updated as all
those children complete.

00:29:17.296 --> 00:29:20.416
Removing all of the smaller
progress bars is left

00:29:20.416 --> 00:29:22.666
as an exercise.

00:29:23.516 --> 00:29:26.626
[Applause]

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:27.326
All right.

00:29:27.326 --> 00:29:27.496
>> VINCE SPADER: Okay.

00:29:27.496 --> 00:29:28.276
Back to slides.

00:29:28.756 --> 00:29:34.316
So now I would like to talk a
little bit about cancellation,

00:29:34.316 --> 00:29:35.616
pausing, and resuming.

00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:39.296
NSProgress objects can be
a conduit for cancellation.

00:29:39.476 --> 00:29:42.596
The creator of the
NSProgress sets cancelable

00:29:42.856 --> 00:29:44.326
and the cancellationHandler.

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:48.126
If your operation is doing
some work synchronously and

00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:49.806
and the cancellationHandler
doesn't really work,

00:29:50.426 --> 00:29:51.996
you can pull the canceled flag

00:29:51.996 --> 00:29:53.616
on the NSProgress
object as well.

00:29:54.156 --> 00:29:59.326
A client can call cancel and
the NSProgress will set cancel

00:29:59.326 --> 00:30:01.986
to true and invoke the
cancellationHandler.

00:30:02.396 --> 00:30:04.666
So cancellation flows
down to children.

00:30:04.986 --> 00:30:08.076
So if you have child progresses
with cancellation handlers,

00:30:08.336 --> 00:30:09.346
those will be invoked too.

00:30:09.996 --> 00:30:11.506
And it is permanent.

00:30:11.726 --> 00:30:14.486
Once a progress is canceled,
there is no uncanceling.

00:30:16.736 --> 00:30:19.046
Pausing is pretty
similar to cancellation.

00:30:19.546 --> 00:30:23.076
The creator of the
NSProgress sets pausable along

00:30:23.076 --> 00:30:25.056
with a pausing handler
and resuming handler.

00:30:25.486 --> 00:30:27.306
That resuming handler
is actually new

00:30:27.306 --> 00:30:29.506
in OS X 10.11 and iOS 9.

00:30:30.336 --> 00:30:33.636
And you can also pull that
paused flag to determine

00:30:33.636 --> 00:30:37.076
if the progress is
currently paused.

00:30:37.256 --> 00:30:39.686
Clients can call pause
and will set pause

00:30:39.686 --> 00:30:43.006
and call the pausing handler,
or they can call resume

00:30:43.006 --> 00:30:45.266
and will unset pause and
invoke the resuming handler.

00:30:45.556 --> 00:30:47.986
Pausing and resuming also flows

00:30:47.986 --> 00:30:50.226
down to child progresses
just like cancellation.

00:30:51.546 --> 00:30:57.406
And let's go ahead
and do a demo of that.

00:30:57.606 --> 00:31:00.356
So if your objects, if your
operations already support

00:31:00.356 --> 00:31:01.886
cancellation, pausing,
and resuming,

00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:04.966
it is actually really easy to
expose that through NSProgress.

00:31:06.016 --> 00:31:08.196
So we're back in our
photos View Controller.

00:31:08.196 --> 00:31:09.686
And this is our root
View Controller.

00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:13.106
And this time the app
has a few more buttons.

00:31:13.106 --> 00:31:16.376
So if you press import, there is
also a cancel and pause button,

00:31:16.376 --> 00:31:18.146
but they don't really
do anything right now.

00:31:18.236 --> 00:31:19.186
And we need to hook them up.

00:31:20.276 --> 00:31:22.406
So let's do that.

00:31:23.096 --> 00:31:25.786
So we have our IBActions
defined for those buttons,

00:31:25.786 --> 00:31:29.206
we have cancel import, pause
import, and resume import.

00:31:29.206 --> 00:31:31.606
And what we're going to do is
we're going to call cancel,

00:31:31.606 --> 00:31:34.876
pause, and resume on the
overall progress inside

00:31:34.876 --> 00:31:35.686
of those actions.

00:31:36.336 --> 00:31:43.966
And now once -- and now that
will call any cancellation,

00:31:43.966 --> 00:31:46.666
pausing, or resuming handlers
on any child progresses.

00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:48.366
And we don't have any yet,

00:31:48.366 --> 00:31:50.296
but our download does
support cancellation,

00:31:50.296 --> 00:31:51.216
pausing, and resuming.

00:31:51.516 --> 00:31:53.096
So let's go to our
photo download.

00:31:53.816 --> 00:31:57.126
And if we go down to our
Will Begin Download callback,

00:31:57.846 --> 00:32:01.016
we can add cancellation,
pausing,

00:32:01.016 --> 00:32:02.956
resuming support
to this NSProgress.

00:32:03.236 --> 00:32:05.956
So first we set cancelable
to true,

00:32:06.696 --> 00:32:08.656
and we set our
cancellationHandler,

00:32:09.486 --> 00:32:12.756
and here our cancellationHandler
is calling Failed Download

00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:15.056
With Error with an
NSUser Canceled Error.

00:32:18.156 --> 00:32:21.076
And we also are pausable and
resumable, so we're going

00:32:21.076 --> 00:32:24.076
to set pausable to true, and in
our pausing handler we're going

00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:25.936
to call this Suspend
Download method.

00:32:26.726 --> 00:32:29.176
And in our resuming handler,
we're calling Resume Download.

00:32:30.026 --> 00:32:33.706
Now, note that these are all
private, the Failed Download

00:32:33.706 --> 00:32:36.236
With Error, Suspend Download,
and Resume Download methods,

00:32:36.786 --> 00:32:39.456
so we're only exposing this
functionality for canceling,

00:32:39.456 --> 00:32:41.396
pausing, or resuming
through NSProgress,

00:32:41.396 --> 00:32:43.426
so it can be a pretty
powerful point of interaction.

00:32:44.956 --> 00:32:51.466
Now when we run the app, and
we compress, start our import

00:32:51.466 --> 00:32:55.226
and pause, and the progress,
the download pauses itself,

00:32:55.956 --> 00:32:58.546
and we press resume,
and it resumes,

00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:00.466
and we can hit cancel,
and it gets canceled.

00:33:00.466 --> 00:33:03.566
And what's happening is that
overall progress is sending --

00:33:03.566 --> 00:33:06.136
invoking any
cancellationHandlers

00:33:06.136 --> 00:33:07.626
for any children it might have.

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.896
And that's it.

00:33:11.066 --> 00:33:12.546
Back to slides.

00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:17.936
[Applause]

00:33:18.436 --> 00:33:18.696
>> VINCE SPADER: All right.

00:33:19.426 --> 00:33:21.686
So let's talk a little bit
about the user interface.

00:33:22.256 --> 00:33:23.626
We have gone through
all of this trouble

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.586
of creating these
NSProgress objects,

00:33:25.656 --> 00:33:28.086
but their ultimate purpose
is to give the user an idea

00:33:28.086 --> 00:33:30.666
of what's happening, and that
means the user interface.

00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:33.536
So all of the properties

00:33:33.536 --> 00:33:36.006
on NSProgress are
key value observable,

00:33:36.386 --> 00:33:39.146
clients can add the KVO
observers to update their UI.

00:33:39.146 --> 00:33:43.056
For example, a client can update
their UI progress views progress

00:33:43.176 --> 00:33:45.496
with the NSProgress as
fractionCompleted property,

00:33:46.176 --> 00:33:48.836
or update a label with
a localizedDescription.

00:33:50.156 --> 00:33:54.626
Also be aware, that these KVO
callbacks might not necessarily

00:33:54.626 --> 00:33:55.996
be called on the main thread.

00:33:56.026 --> 00:33:58.516
So if you're updating
UIControls, you want to move

00:33:58.516 --> 00:33:59.766
that work to the main queue.

00:34:00.336 --> 00:34:02.736
So here is an example of what

00:34:02.786 --> 00:34:04.906
that adding an observer
might look like.

00:34:06.396 --> 00:34:10.976
You call addObserver for
key path on the NSProgress

00:34:11.585 --> 00:34:13.306
for the fractionCompleted
property.

00:34:14.346 --> 00:34:16.946
Then in our override
of observe Value

00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:20.716
For Key Path we enqueue
some work on the main queue,

00:34:21.356 --> 00:34:23.735
and on the main queue we
get the fractionCompleted

00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:26.886
from the NSProgress, and
update our UIProgressView.

00:34:27.446 --> 00:34:28.896
And that's basically it.

00:34:28.896 --> 00:34:31.556
You can use a similar
pattern for updating labels

00:34:31.746 --> 00:34:33.376
or buttons in your UI.

00:34:33.376 --> 00:34:37.166
All right, finally, let's go

00:34:37.166 --> 00:34:39.735
over some best practice
for NSProgress.

00:34:39.735 --> 00:34:42.896
Since this talk is called best
practices, I better squeeze some

00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:45.315
in at the last minute.

00:34:45.456 --> 00:34:47.346
So, first is completion.

00:34:47.876 --> 00:34:50.686
Don't use fractionCompleted
to determine completion.

00:34:50.686 --> 00:34:53.085
It's a floating point
value determined --

00:34:53.085 --> 00:34:54.446
derived from a calculation.

00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:58.346
So comparing it to 1.0
won't always be right.

00:34:58.346 --> 00:35:02.896
Use completedUnitCount and
totalUnitCount instead,

00:35:02.896 --> 00:35:04.456
unless your progress
is indeterminant

00:35:04.456 --> 00:35:05.766
or the totalUnitCount is 0.

00:35:07.456 --> 00:35:10.666
It is important, by the way,
that progress is finished.

00:35:10.716 --> 00:35:13.646
The parents completedUnitCount
only gets updated

00:35:13.766 --> 00:35:14.956
when the child finishes.

00:35:15.376 --> 00:35:19.226
And also NSProgress can optimize
a way of completed children

00:35:19.226 --> 00:35:21.686
so memory can be saved
as work finishes.

00:35:23.876 --> 00:35:27.846
Next, NSProgress
objects cannot be reused.

00:35:28.206 --> 00:35:29.616
Once they're done, they're done.

00:35:29.876 --> 00:35:32.126
Once they're canceled,
they're canceled.

00:35:32.186 --> 00:35:34.146
If you need to reuse
an NSProgress,

00:35:34.546 --> 00:35:36.956
instead make a new instance
and provide a mechanism

00:35:36.956 --> 00:35:39.026
so the client of
your progress knows

00:35:39.026 --> 00:35:41.496
that the object has been
replaced, like a notification.

00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:45.446
Finally, performance.

00:35:46.926 --> 00:35:48.866
Don't update the
completedUnitCount

00:35:48.866 --> 00:35:49.956
in a tight loop.

00:35:49.956 --> 00:35:53.696
So, for example, don't update
it every byte of a download.

00:35:53.696 --> 00:35:55.476
If you have a parent,
we might be calling

00:35:55.476 --> 00:35:57.606
up to update the
fractionCompleted,

00:35:57.816 --> 00:35:59.596
which might take longer
than you're expecting

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:03.226
since your composition can be
arbitrarily large and very deep.

00:36:03.876 --> 00:36:07.426
But when you do so, don't
forget to finish the progress.

00:36:07.426 --> 00:36:09.286
So be sure to update
the completedUnitCount

00:36:09.286 --> 00:36:10.236
to the totalUnitCount.

00:36:10.646 --> 00:36:11.856
Otherwise you're
going to be left

00:36:11.856 --> 00:36:13.046
with nearly finished progresses.

00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:15.406
And that's no fun.

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:16.206
So that's it.

00:36:16.666 --> 00:36:20.256
We talked a lot about how to
use NSProgress effectively.

00:36:20.256 --> 00:36:24.496
If there is anything to
remember, it is these points.

00:36:24.496 --> 00:36:26.636
Each progress has its own unit.

00:36:27.056 --> 00:36:30.806
You can compose them either
implicitly or explicitly.

00:36:31.026 --> 00:36:33.156
And when you do, the
pendingUnitCount is

00:36:33.156 --> 00:36:34.596
in the parent's units.

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:38.516
Also you either create the
NSProgress or you're a client.

00:36:39.426 --> 00:36:42.976
For localization, you can use
the kind and userInfo properties

00:36:42.976 --> 00:36:45.666
to help us give you a
better localizedDescription.

00:36:47.276 --> 00:36:50.656
NSProgress can be a really nice
interface for cancellation,

00:36:50.656 --> 00:36:51.996
pausing, and resuming.

00:36:52.226 --> 00:36:57.066
And all its properties are KVO
observable, so you can use it,

00:36:57.066 --> 00:37:00.166
use that to update your UI.

00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:00.746
>> That's it.

00:37:00.746 --> 00:37:03.146
For more information,
see the documentation;

00:37:03.466 --> 00:37:05.446
also check out the
header for NSProgress,

00:37:05.446 --> 00:37:06.906
it is extremely well commented.

00:37:06.986 --> 00:37:10.066
We have some new sample
code, photoProgress,

00:37:10.066 --> 00:37:12.936
which is based off the
demos I showed today.

00:37:12.936 --> 00:37:15.906
If you need any help,
try the developer forums

00:37:15.906 --> 00:37:17.726
or contact developer
technical support,

00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:20.986
and for general inquiries,
email Paul Marcos.

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:21.696
And that's all.

00:37:22.266 --> 00:37:22.496
Thanks.

00:37:23.508 --> 00:37:25.508
[Applause]
