00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:28.776
>> ABHINAV PATHAK: Hello.

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:32.206
Hello, everyone.

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:33.506
Good morning.

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:37.016
Hope you are having
a great WWDC so far.

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.516
I'm Abhinav Pathak, along with
my colleague, Pai-Han Huang,

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:43.126
we are going to talk about
debugging energy issues.

00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:46.556
We are going to show you the
tools that we already have

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:50.946
and the new tools we built
this year specifically for iOS,

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:56.226
using which you can find energy
problems in your app and, two,

00:00:56.406 --> 00:01:00.256
fix them so that your
customers really like your app.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:01.396
Let's begin.

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:04.245
The red battery icon.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.256
How much we all hate it
when it happens to us.

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:09.836
Customers also hate this.

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.796
Having a good battery
life is really important

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:17.406
to having an awesome
user experience.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:22.176
Time and time again, it has
come up that battery life is one

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:24.996
of the most important
feature that people want.

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:28.616
At Apple, we take great strides

00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:32.066
to ensure customers get a
good battery life experience.

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:37.576
However, the apps the
customer run have equal

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:41.396
or usually more say in
how the energy is drained

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:41.946
from their device.

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:47.356
To help our customers understand
which app is draining battery,

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:50.716
which app is heavy in terms of
energy, a couple of years ago

00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:56.016
on OS X side, we had an activity
monitor monitor energy impact,

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.206
where you can see, for
each and every app,

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:02.896
what is the instantaneous
impact and what is the impact

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:05.626
for a period of time so
that users can get, hey,

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:06.696
what happened on their device?

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:11.926
On iOS 8, last year we
introduced battery usage UI,

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:17.186
a customer-facing UI, where they
can go and see in last 24 hours,

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:20.606
and last 7 days, what is the
proportion of energy breakdown

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:23.646
in different application
that is they have used.

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:28.896
An app coming at the top could
have very legitimate reasons,

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:31.796
hey, I love this app,
I use it all the time.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.886
To help customers understand
what is the factor here,

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:41.176
this year we have included a
single toggle at the top of it

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:44.506
where they can toggle and
see how much usage there is,

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:46.996
how much screen time
the app got,

00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:49.176
and how much it ran
in the background.

00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:52.556
And then they can assess
hey, I used it more, or hey,

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:56.236
this app consumes
a lot of energy.

00:02:56.536 --> 00:03:00.226
This talk is about if your
app is coming on the top

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:02.186
of this list, how you can get it

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:05.376
down while maintaining
the same utilization

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:07.856
or giving the same
utility to your user.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:11.256
This talk is also about
people who usually come down,

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:12.836
how they can further come down

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.086
and get a good customer
experience.

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:19.916
To give a high-level overview,
we are going to quickly go

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:21.906
through energy fundamentals
and best practices.

00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:24.266
We are going to summarize the
talk we had in the morning.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:28.056
We are going to show you the
energy debugging workflow

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:31.236
and the tools we have
on how to debug energy.

00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:33.426
We are going to have a demo

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:36.786
where we will fix energy
problems in a sample app

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:39.386
that we have built
specifically for this talk

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.576
and show you how easy
it is to go ahead

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:49.316
and fix energy problems, and
then we will close this talk.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.126
Very simple.

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:51.226
Everybody knows this.

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:52.806
Energy 101.

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:54.606
Energy is equal to
power times time.

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.676
What we are seeing
here is a graph,

00:03:57.076 --> 00:03:59.266
X-axis is time, Y-axis is power.

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:01.316
It's a waveform of
an application usage.

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:02.176
What happened?

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:04.936
Let's say a user launches an
app, a bunch of activities,

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:07.656
backgrounded the app, and
the app got suspended.

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:11.846
The single most important
point here is the entire area

00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:14.646
under the graph is
the energy consumption

00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:17.396
of this particular app.

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:20.396
Energy is dictated
by power and time,

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:22.366
and to illustrate
the point further,

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:26.956
if we take two rectangles here,
they are differing in terms

00:04:26.956 --> 00:04:28.946
of how much power they
consume, differing in terms

00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:31.766
of how much time they consume,
but they are equal energy wise.

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:39.136
Second concept, there's
something called fixed cost,

00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:40.556
there's something
called dynamic cost.

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:44.256
A lot of hardware components
we have in our systems,

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:47.736
if you have to use them, we have
to first bring them into a state

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:49.536
where they can start
serving your requests.

00:04:50.476 --> 00:04:53.876
These states are very high
energy consumption in terms

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:55.326
of -- compared to
-- the sleep states.

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:58.626
Once they are brought up, they
do the work that you asked it

00:04:58.686 --> 00:05:02.616
to do, and then we keep them in
that state in anticipation of,

00:05:02.896 --> 00:05:04.516
you know, further
work is going to come.

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:06.266
Once we see there's
no work coming up,

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:10.686
we quiet them down,
let them go to sleep.

00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:14.006
Fixed cost can be
very, very expensive,

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:16.556
and we will see throughout
this talk how we will go

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:19.246
after this fixed cost
whenever it starts impacting

00:05:19.596 --> 00:05:20.216
your application.

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:25.016
When it comes down to
reducing energy usage,

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:28.206
there are very simple three
rules that you need to follow.

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:30.686
First rule, do it never.

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:34.826
Does a customer really
need that work to be done?

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.716
If you don't do it, fixed
cost, dynamic cost, energy,

00:05:37.716 --> 00:05:39.126
power time -- all the
things we have talked --

00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:40.306
is a grand total of zero.

00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:45.406
Awesome. If you need
to do it, do it less.

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:48.496
What is the least amount of work

00:05:48.496 --> 00:05:50.086
to satisfy the customer's
request?

00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:54.966
Next thing, do it
at a better time.

00:05:54.996 --> 00:05:57.386
A customer is out in the
wild, taking photographs.

00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:59.096
Do I need to upload it
to the server right now?

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:01.166
Have some tolerance, maybe

00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:03.176
when a user is connected
to a power outlet.

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:07.166
Third, do it efficiently.

00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:09.606
What is the best
efficient algorithm

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:12.286
or the best thing I can
do to serve this request?

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:15.546
We will see how these things
come back again and again

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:20.226
in different parts of the talk.

00:06:20.786 --> 00:06:24.186
To jump in the energy debugging
workflow and tools we have,

00:06:24.916 --> 00:06:27.956
let's look at how does an energy
debugging workflow look like?

00:06:28.156 --> 00:06:30.466
It's very similar to normal
software engineering practices.

00:06:30.876 --> 00:06:33.076
What you do: you
write code and build.

00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:36.356
You run it on a very
simple debugger which tries

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:38.826
to show you what's the
high-level problems

00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:39.366
in your code.

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:42.096
A lot of problems you
can easily identify,

00:06:42.096 --> 00:06:43.536
fix, and you run it again.

00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:47.846
Some of the problems, though,
are hard, so you go ahead

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:50.986
and say let me get a
focused debugger, you know?

00:06:51.116 --> 00:06:52.246
Hey, I have a memory issue.

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:55.286
Let me get a focused tool only
on memory that can pinpoint

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:58.766
in my app exact line of the
code, where is the problem?

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:01.106
And once you are
done with all this,

00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:04.046
you ship it to your customers
and your customers use it.

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:08.016
On OS X side, we have
Xcode, where we write

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:10.356
and build your application.

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:14.626
As part of general
debugger, within Xcode,

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:16.246
there are energy
debugging tools,

00:07:16.246 --> 00:07:17.516
which we are going
to talk about.

00:07:18.116 --> 00:07:21.616
These show primarily hints
of how your app is behaving.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:26.416
As part of instruments,
we have focus tools.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:28.026
Once you have identified, hey,

00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:29.906
this part of the
system is a problem,

00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:31.746
let me go ahead and fix this.

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:34.546
And customers, as we talked
about, they have energy impact,

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:37.076
and they can go ahead
and look at it.

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:39.086
Before we jump into the tools,

00:07:39.556 --> 00:07:42.346
let's look at energy
debugging priorities on OS X.

00:07:42.936 --> 00:07:45.076
The reason is the
tools are very focused

00:07:45.076 --> 00:07:47.646
on energy debugging priority
because they point you

00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:52.606
to exactly the location where
you need to fix your problem.

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:58.526
Priorities on OS X
are the CPU and GPU.

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.046
They have a very,
very high fixed cost.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:05.986
To bring it to a state
where they can serve you

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.626
or your request in
the idle state,

00:08:08.846 --> 00:08:12.026
it is ten times the power
consumption of as compared

00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:13.226
to when they are
in the sleep state.

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.356
Once they are in the idle state,
if you use CPU for 1 percent,

00:08:17.646 --> 00:08:20.956
that is 10 percent more on
top of idle power consumption.

00:08:21.586 --> 00:08:23.146
And from then on,
it goes exponential.

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:27.506
10 percent CPU, two times idle;
100 percent CPU, 100 times idle.

00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:30.186
Very simple rule here.

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:33.196
Do not wake the CPU up
if you do not need to.

00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:34.535
Let the giant bear sleep.

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:36.246
Don't poke it.

00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:40.966
The tool we have in Xcode,
I call it energy gauges,

00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:44.726
it prints you an energy report
that looks something like this.

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:45.846
How do you get there?

00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:48.076
You click -- once you are
running your application,

00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:50.356
click on the debug
analysis part.

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:52.396
Once you click there, you
see a bunch of gauges.

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:54.336
Click on the energy
impact gauge.

00:08:54.376 --> 00:08:55.756
You will see the report.

00:08:56.666 --> 00:09:00.316
What do you see in the report?

00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:06.356
So primarily, you'll see if you
are being a bad citizen of OS X,

00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:11.076
basically, you have -- if
you are using high CPU.

00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:13.926
If you are preventing your --

00:09:14.466 --> 00:09:17.826
your application is in
background, user is not looking

00:09:17.826 --> 00:09:21.326
at it, system will try to put
you in App Nap, which is a kind

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:23.696
of background suspend, and
you are preventing system

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:24.256
to do that.

00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:26.226
You are not actively
serving any request,

00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:27.746
but you are burning
a lot of energy.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:29.586
Idle prevention.

00:09:29.586 --> 00:09:31.666
You are not letting the CPU
to go to into idle state.

00:09:31.666 --> 00:09:35.176
If it cannot go into idle, it
cannot go into sleep state.

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:39.026
Once gone into sleep state,
the CPU wake overhead says hey,

00:09:39.026 --> 00:09:42.746
you are responsible
to bring this guy up.

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.626
Once you have figured
out high level

00:09:45.656 --> 00:09:46.946
where the problem comes in,

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:50.426
what you can do is just
underneath the report,

00:09:50.426 --> 00:09:51.896
you have first of
all the description

00:09:51.896 --> 00:09:53.236
of the things we
just talked about,

00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:56.976
but you have these buttons which
you can jump into instruments,

00:09:57.436 --> 00:09:59.936
and these tools are
specifically designed for each

00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:03.016
and every area, and they can,
you know, help you pinpoint,

00:10:03.016 --> 00:10:05.996
hey, which line of code
is actually causing high

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:07.086
CPU utilization?

00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:09.806
Which line of code is
causing the wake overhead?

00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:14.476
You can go ahead
and debug your app.

00:10:15.046 --> 00:10:17.716
When it comes to principles
of reducing energy on OS X,

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:21.136
we come back to our three simple
rules: do it never/do it less.

00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:23.136
You want to coalesce
all the timers.

00:10:23.396 --> 00:10:25.586
You don't want to wake up
the system again and again.

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:27.126
Minimize CPU wakes.

00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:29.376
Do it at a better time.

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.756
Use the background
activity scheduler APIs,

00:10:32.756 --> 00:10:35.016
where you can specify
a lot of parameters

00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:37.196
and let the system choose
the right time for you.

00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:41.636
Do it efficiently, set
the right work priorities,

00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:43.736
QoS work priorities,
on your work queues.

00:10:44.496 --> 00:10:45.486
Program a computer algorithm.

00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:55.096
Moving on to iOS, CPU is still
a dominant energy consumption.

00:10:56.226 --> 00:10:59.276
But given the fact that
these devices are different

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:05.916
than OS X devices, a few
other things come into play.

00:11:06.616 --> 00:11:09.486
First of all, two of the
peripheries, location

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:12.446
and networking, can be
equally costly as CPU

00:11:12.576 --> 00:11:14.516
if not more in some use cases.

00:11:15.076 --> 00:11:19.686
Next, when an app runs
in the background,

00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:23.106
your app consumes all
these three hardware

00:11:23.326 --> 00:11:25.116
and it consumes a lot of energy.

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.766
You don't have the display
energy, but still all the rest

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:31.046
of components are huge in
terms of energy consumption.

00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:35.776
So let's look at each
of these one by one.

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:38.406
Location energy usually
acts like this.

00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:40.016
It's not very high in power.

00:11:40.176 --> 00:11:42.516
The power is data mined by
which API you have called

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:45.006
and what is the precision
with which you are calling it.

00:11:46.116 --> 00:11:47.266
The time component is big,

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:49.636
and that is how the
energy becomes really huge.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:54.956
When it comes to fixing location
issues, again, same principles:

00:11:54.956 --> 00:11:57.746
do it never, do continuous
location only

00:11:57.746 --> 00:11:59.176
if you actually need it,

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.076
it has actually been
requested by the user.

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:03.856
And please stop once
you are done with it.

00:12:03.906 --> 00:12:04.916
Once you get the location,

00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:08.096
once your request is
satisfied, just stop it.

00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:10.666
Next, do it efficiently.

00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:12.256
What is the best
accuracy you need?

00:12:12.256 --> 00:12:14.186
Do you need to know
exactly within three feet

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:17.656
where the user is standing on
earth or the city is good enough

00:12:17.656 --> 00:12:19.386
in predicting weather for it?

00:12:20.336 --> 00:12:21.286
What are you trying to do?

00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:24.976
We have went ahead in the
location site and we said hey,

00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:28.586
there are a set of use cases
where people want to have

00:12:29.026 --> 00:12:31.826
and for each of the use
cases, we have designed APIs

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:35.906
that help serve better
the developers, you.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:40.536
Try to read on these APIs
what actually you want

00:12:40.536 --> 00:12:47.266
and we'll do the energy
management really nice for you.

00:12:47.486 --> 00:12:49.356
When it comes to networking,

00:12:49.356 --> 00:12:51.836
very similar principles:
do it never.

00:12:51.836 --> 00:12:52.746
Cut down transfers.

00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:55.186
Can you cache, can you compress?

00:12:55.326 --> 00:12:57.246
Do you need the highest
quality media

00:12:57.246 --> 00:12:58.496
on the smallest form factor?

00:13:01.766 --> 00:13:02.806
Can you do it at a better time?

00:13:02.806 --> 00:13:03.966
Can you consider tolerance?

00:13:04.186 --> 00:13:05.256
When is it needed?

00:13:05.596 --> 00:13:07.746
Can you mark it as
a discretionary?

00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:09.706
The moment you mark
it discretionary,

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:10.586
the system takes over.

00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:13.136
You can specify, hey,
in the next 6 hours

00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:15.766
or the next 12 hours, I
need this to be uploaded

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:17.796
or downloaded, and
the system will figure

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:20.446
out what's the best time,
will do the activity for you,

00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:24.106
and once it's done, it will tell
you hey, this activity is done.

00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:26.656
Do it more efficiently.

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:28.626
Coalesce transfers.

00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:30.696
Let's take a look at an example.

00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:31.866
What do we mean by this?

00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:35.116
Let's say you have a requirement
where you have to sync data

00:13:35.116 --> 00:13:37.226
to a server, user is
using your app and have

00:13:37.256 --> 00:13:40.646
to periodically sync as it's
being generated on the device.

00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:42.646
Very simple solution.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.486
As the data is getting generated

00:13:45.486 --> 00:13:47.486
on the device, just
keep pushing it.

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:49.406
What happens here?

00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:53.556
For every push, you bring the
data up, you send your 2 bytes,

00:13:53.556 --> 00:13:55.646
10 bytes, 100 bytes, radio stays

00:13:55.646 --> 00:13:57.356
on for a long time,
it goes to sleep.

00:13:58.056 --> 00:13:59.516
Next push, the same is repeated.

00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:04.036
The fixed cost is very
high in that point.

00:14:05.226 --> 00:14:05.906
How do you fix it?

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:07.166
Very simple.

00:14:07.686 --> 00:14:08.866
Coalesce all the transfers.

00:14:09.276 --> 00:14:11.706
Let the user interact with
the device, build a state,

00:14:12.066 --> 00:14:14.646
and once in a while send
the state to the cloud

00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:18.886
so that you pay the cost only
once, the cost of fixed price.

00:14:19.476 --> 00:14:25.446
Moving to background,
first thing,

00:14:25.446 --> 00:14:29.726
background when your app is
running at the background,

00:14:29.846 --> 00:14:31.936
it is draining energy
from the user.

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:34.526
Please don't do anything
in background

00:14:34.526 --> 00:14:35.916
if you don't need to do it.

00:14:37.416 --> 00:14:40.586
If you need to do it, call your
task completion handler as quick

00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:46.406
as possible, and this task
completion handler is an

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:48.256
indication to the system
saying, hey, I am done.

00:14:48.716 --> 00:14:49.436
Please suspend me.

00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:51.426
Please let the device
go to sleep.

00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:53.556
Do it efficiently.

00:14:53.766 --> 00:14:56.146
There are a lot of background
APIs that you can, you know,

00:14:56.356 --> 00:14:59.396
give your system a hand, you
know, please do the work for me

00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:02.566
as you find the best time
and the best, you know,

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:05.946
period energy wise and the
system will do it for you.

00:15:06.046 --> 00:15:11.576
To go back to the energy
debugging workflow on iOS,

00:15:11.936 --> 00:15:13.816
what we have so far,
we have Xcode,

00:15:13.816 --> 00:15:14.976
where you write and
build your code.

00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:17.846
Customers have battery usage UI

00:15:17.846 --> 00:15:20.486
where they can see how your
app is performing energy wise.

00:15:21.326 --> 00:15:27.606
So far, we have had for a few
years a tool called Energy

00:15:27.606 --> 00:15:30.716
Diagnostics in Instruments that
can give you a first-cut idea

00:15:30.716 --> 00:15:32.126
of how your app is behaving.

00:15:32.796 --> 00:15:34.216
Let's take a look at this tool.

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.006
How do you enable it?

00:15:36.346 --> 00:15:39.836
You go to settings, developer,
go to the logging pane.

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:43.536
You turn on the energy
toggle here

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.406
and then you say,
hey, start recording.

00:15:45.496 --> 00:15:49.906
Once you have started
recording, use your app

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:51.136
as your customer will.

00:15:51.566 --> 00:15:54.146
Live on it for a
few hours, 12 hours,

00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:56.106
24 hours, a few days or so.

00:15:56.626 --> 00:15:57.456
And once you are done,

00:15:57.906 --> 00:15:59.266
just click the button,
stop recording.

00:16:03.116 --> 00:16:06.236
After this, connect your
device to a Mac and go

00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:08.946
to the instrument, select
Energy Diagnostics, and say hey,

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:10.686
please import the log
data that you have.

00:16:11.426 --> 00:16:13.316
Once you do that, you
will get a picture,

00:16:13.316 --> 00:16:17.516
which is something like this.

00:16:27.046 --> 00:16:29.246
You'll see Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,

00:16:29.426 --> 00:16:31.776
and you'll see how long they
were on, when they were on,

00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:33.206
when they were off, and so on.

00:16:33.276 --> 00:16:36.276
You will see how many packets
were sent out of each interface,

00:16:36.276 --> 00:16:37.606
what was the CPU activity.

00:16:38.086 --> 00:16:40.346
At the top, you will see
an energy usage level,

00:16:40.346 --> 00:16:42.176
which with is a number
out of 20.

00:16:42.176 --> 00:16:44.516
If you are 20 out of 20,
believe me, it's a problem.

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:47.176
Very, very high energy
consumption.

00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:50.836
You want to stay close to 1.

00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:54.076
This tool is good if you
want to do long experiments.

00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:58.116
But what it doesn't do is it
doesn't tell you why did the

00:16:58.116 --> 00:16:58.936
hardware come up?

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:00.336
Did you request it?

00:17:00.336 --> 00:17:01.636
Where did you request it?

00:17:02.066 --> 00:17:06.006
It doesn't pinpoint, it's not
fine-grain to go to your code.

00:17:07.205 --> 00:17:13.016
To fix this problem, this year
we are introducing energy gauges

00:17:13.736 --> 00:17:18.086
on iOS and instruments,
a few instruments too,

00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:20.715
which you can use to
pinpoint in your code

00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:22.546
where the problem
is coming from.

00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:27.175
To talk about all of
these, let's move to demo.

00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:32.286
I call Pai-Han Huang, my
colleague, to talk all about it.

00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:36.686
[ Applause ]

00:17:37.186 --> 00:17:38.956
>> PAI-HAN HUANG: So, in
a demo, I will walk you

00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:42.266
through the major features of
the new energy bugging tools,

00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:46.916
demo the app, and show you
how we can use the new tools

00:17:46.916 --> 00:17:50.326
to identify and improve the
energy efficiency of your app.

00:17:50.876 --> 00:17:55.416
So as a developer, I like these
new tools because they are easy,

00:17:55.946 --> 00:17:58.376
they are effective, so
at the end of the demo,

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:01.886
I hope you will join me in
including these new tools

00:18:01.886 --> 00:18:03.256
as part of your project cycle.

00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:06.986
There are two major
components in the demo.

00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:11.646
One is the new tool set; the
other one is the demo app.

00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:15.416
So let me start from introducing
you to the new tool set.

00:18:21.176 --> 00:18:23.616
On the screen, what we are
seeing is the screenshot

00:18:24.276 --> 00:18:27.016
of iOS energy gauge,
which is the entry point

00:18:27.616 --> 00:18:30.066
to all the other new
energy debugging tools

00:18:30.066 --> 00:18:30.996
for iOS this year.

00:18:33.026 --> 00:18:34.696
So where is it?

00:18:35.556 --> 00:18:39.376
It is actually inside
debug navigator of Xcode,

00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:41.536
which you can find over here.

00:18:42.926 --> 00:18:44.866
After you launch your
apps through Xcode,

00:18:45.336 --> 00:18:49.046
you will be populated
automatically for you over here.

00:18:50.086 --> 00:18:52.376
And when you click
it, it will bring you

00:18:52.376 --> 00:18:53.736
to the right-hand
side of the screen.

00:18:54.346 --> 00:18:58.816
And the iOS energy gauge can
visualize the energy impact

00:18:58.816 --> 00:19:01.916
of your code, can visualize
the energy impact of your code,

00:19:02.456 --> 00:19:05.596
both instantaneously and
in the average instance.

00:19:06.586 --> 00:19:09.286
So the first is the
instantaneous energy impact

00:19:09.366 --> 00:19:11.206
of your code, can be found

00:19:11.206 --> 00:19:13.986
in the field meter,
which is over here.

00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:21.126
There are three different
zones in this graph.

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:24.086
In the speedometer, the lowest
one, when the needle points

00:19:24.086 --> 00:19:26.336
to a green zone, it
means the energy impact

00:19:26.336 --> 00:19:28.026
of your code is actually
reasonable.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:29.636
Congratulations.

00:19:29.766 --> 00:19:32.276
You are a good citizen
of the iOS ecosystem.

00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:36.386
But still, we suggest you to
take a look at these new tools

00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:39.086
to see how you can make
your customers happier.

00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:43.316
When the needle moves up,
it enters the yellow zone.

00:19:44.436 --> 00:19:47.516
In the yellow zone, the energy
impact of your code is high,

00:19:48.266 --> 00:19:51.066
so it's likely that if you
don't deal with it carefully,

00:19:51.906 --> 00:19:55.626
your app will show up high
in the battery usage UI.

00:19:56.436 --> 00:19:58.946
So please use the new
energy debugging tools

00:19:59.226 --> 00:20:02.416
to see how you can improve the
energy efficiency of your code.

00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:07.956
But if the needle keeps moving
up, you enter the red zone.

00:20:08.306 --> 00:20:11.526
Red zone indicates
that the energy impact

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:13.086
of your code is very high.

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:17.016
It means that even with the
slight usage of your app,

00:20:17.996 --> 00:20:19.516
users will significantly --

00:20:19.516 --> 00:20:22.146
will experience significant
battery drop on your device.

00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:25.256
So please use the new tools!

00:20:25.586 --> 00:20:25.986
Please [laughter]!

00:20:28.076 --> 00:20:29.186
Sorry, I apologize.

00:20:29.336 --> 00:20:32.226
That's the evil in me
protesting to the people

00:20:32.756 --> 00:20:34.736
who don't take battery
life seriously.

00:20:35.486 --> 00:20:38.656
I promise you, I am a very nice
guy, so come to chat with me,

00:20:38.656 --> 00:20:40.396
you know, in the last
session this afternoon.

00:20:41.276 --> 00:20:44.946
Okay? Okay.

00:20:45.376 --> 00:20:50.586
But speedometer can give you
an instantaneous energy impact

00:20:50.586 --> 00:20:52.896
information overall of your app.

00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:59.306
If you want to see more
breakdown, you should see here,

00:21:00.476 --> 00:21:01.366
energy impact session.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.656
So this graph will be
refreshed once every second.

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:11.576
If your app introduces any
workload to CPU, location,

00:21:12.346 --> 00:21:15.576
or networking, you will
see a block showing

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:19.336
up on the top three rows in
the corresponding time slots.

00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:22.606
And, as an earlier
talk it was mentioned,

00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:25.426
your app can consume
significant power,

00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:28.156
not just on the foreground,
but on the background as well.

00:21:28.966 --> 00:21:30.486
So based on this observation,

00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:32.106
we have the fourth
rule, background.

00:21:33.026 --> 00:21:36.346
When your app stays in the
background and doesn't go away,

00:21:37.066 --> 00:21:40.326
you will see the moving blocks
showing up on the fourth row.

00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:45.556
On top of the graph, you will
see a series of color bars.

00:21:45.736 --> 00:21:47.966
And they look like this.

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:49.686
Two colors.

00:21:50.766 --> 00:21:56.316
Red color means that that is
overhead, energy used to bring

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:59.966
up the system resources like
the radio module to perform work

00:22:00.136 --> 00:22:03.046
for your app, and it also
maps to an earlier talk,

00:22:03.596 --> 00:22:05.346
the fixed cost of the hardware.

00:22:05.906 --> 00:22:11.886
For the blue one, it represents
the energy which has been used

00:22:11.886 --> 00:22:15.026
to service the workload
introduced by your app.

00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:18.176
Besides instantaneous
information,

00:22:18.176 --> 00:22:19.866
we also provide average
information.

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:24.926
For example, like this one, the
average overhead in percentile,

00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:30.016
and this guy shows you
the average energy impact.

00:22:30.486 --> 00:22:36.026
On the bottom, you will see
a series of explanations

00:22:36.026 --> 00:22:39.636
about legend, CPU, location,
networking, and background.

00:22:40.036 --> 00:22:43.086
And it also provides some tips
about how you can optimize them.

00:22:44.506 --> 00:22:48.366
But please remember that
iOS energy gauge is designed

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:51.826
to show you quick the
high-level understanding

00:22:51.826 --> 00:22:54.166
about your energy
impact of your code.

00:22:54.696 --> 00:22:57.636
So if you want more detailed
information, more breakdown,

00:22:58.226 --> 00:22:59.866
then check this button.

00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:03.776
This button, after you click
it, it will trampoline you

00:23:03.776 --> 00:23:05.766
to the corresponding instrument,

00:23:05.956 --> 00:23:11.076
to give you breakdown energy
information for your app.

00:23:11.396 --> 00:23:12.706
This is the iOS energy gauge.

00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:17.176
Let me next briefly
introduce you to instruments.

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.376
Instruments, as many of
you already use them:

00:23:20.846 --> 00:23:21.836
it looks very similar.

00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:24.146
For example, the one you see

00:23:24.146 --> 00:23:27.536
on the screen is the
location instrument.

00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:30.516
How do we start?

00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:36.046
We start from toggle this
button, record it, and stop it.

00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:41.186
After you record it, you
will see the system activity

00:23:41.866 --> 00:23:43.006
like this.

00:23:43.206 --> 00:23:46.276
And you will see some reasons

00:23:46.276 --> 00:23:48.636
about why you see
this kind of activity.

00:23:48.826 --> 00:23:51.366
For example, here you will
see the location service

00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:53.526
that is trying to
request for location.

00:23:54.896 --> 00:23:57.086
And if you want more
information, more detail,

00:23:58.126 --> 00:24:00.136
go here, extended detail.

00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:05.726
Then you will bring up this
guy, which is the code stack.

00:24:06.366 --> 00:24:10.766
So this is the introduction
to the instruments.

00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:14.076
Next, let me briefly
talk about the demo app.

00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:18.836
On the screen, you will see
a screenshot of our demo app,

00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:20.206
which we call Energy Buddy.

00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:23.236
So, as an iOS power
software engineer,

00:24:23.356 --> 00:24:27.096
I am eager to know whether I
can improve my energy efficiency

00:24:27.236 --> 00:24:29.036
everywhere, not just
on my phone,

00:24:29.316 --> 00:24:31.556
but in my daily life as well.

00:24:31.676 --> 00:24:33.636
Energy Buddy can suit
my needs pretty well.

00:24:33.886 --> 00:24:35.326
I can use it to take a picture,

00:24:36.086 --> 00:24:38.916
and it will extract
the usage information

00:24:38.916 --> 00:24:41.986
from the picture I take for
energy meter, for example.

00:24:42.836 --> 00:24:45.146
Then it will query the
location of my device,

00:24:46.416 --> 00:24:48.756
get the weather information
based on my location,

00:24:49.506 --> 00:24:51.656
correlate the weather
information with my usage,

00:24:51.796 --> 00:24:53.526
showing up on the screen.

00:24:54.116 --> 00:24:56.086
The structure is like this.

00:24:56.176 --> 00:25:01.766
There is a centralized data
manager, and if I import a photo

00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:05.646
from there, it will try
to get a reading from it.

00:25:05.646 --> 00:25:06.786
And based on the location,

00:25:06.926 --> 00:25:11.756
it will try to hit
a networking service

00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:14.056
to get the weather information
based on my location.

00:25:15.036 --> 00:25:17.966
And then data manager will
correlate this information,

00:25:17.966 --> 00:25:20.026
showing up as a curve
on the screen.

00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:24.076
So next, let's try
to give it a shot

00:25:24.076 --> 00:25:27.616
and see how the new tools
can help us identify

00:25:27.616 --> 00:25:29.686
and improve energy
efficiency of Energy Buddy.

00:25:29.836 --> 00:25:34.756
So on the left-hand side of
the screen, you will see Xcode.

00:25:35.226 --> 00:25:37.906
Right-hand side is the
screenshot of my testing device.

00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:40.956
So let's start from
launching Energy Buddy

00:25:41.196 --> 00:25:42.906
by opening the project files.

00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:47.256
So what it's currently doing is,
after I hit the round button,

00:25:48.186 --> 00:25:52.086
it will try to build a
binary file and transport it

00:25:52.086 --> 00:25:54.046
into the device and
launch it for me.

00:25:54.516 --> 00:25:56.826
So once it's launched,
we will see this.

00:25:57.426 --> 00:25:57.736
It's here.

00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:03.996
So let's go to debug
navigator over here.

00:26:04.206 --> 00:26:08.526
Energy impact over
here...oh, there we go.

00:26:09.816 --> 00:26:10.916
The first thing we want

00:26:10.956 --> 00:26:16.846
to see is whether there's
any moving block over here

00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:18.946
because currently I don't
do anything with the UI.

00:26:20.186 --> 00:26:21.946
So it seems like
it's pretty clear

00:26:21.946 --> 00:26:23.116
of those kind of moving blocks.

00:26:23.546 --> 00:26:26.156
This is a good sign because
when the app is idle,

00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:28.196
not too much should happen.

00:26:28.516 --> 00:26:29.176
So this is good.

00:26:29.946 --> 00:26:32.556
So let me try to import
a photo by clicking the

00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:36.896
"Import Photo" button, select
a photo from my gallery.

00:26:37.556 --> 00:26:39.796
It will try to extract
information,

00:26:39.796 --> 00:26:41.126
and I will set the reading.

00:26:42.346 --> 00:26:46.546
Okay. Oh, okay, I see lots
of activity coming up,

00:26:47.526 --> 00:26:49.876
including CPU, networking,
and location.

00:26:50.406 --> 00:26:53.356
But among them, I
immediately notice one thing.

00:26:54.036 --> 00:26:56.016
That is location is always on.

00:26:56.016 --> 00:26:57.846
Huh. It doesn't make sense.

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:01.146
Because Energy Buddy is not the
kind of app where you're trying

00:27:01.146 --> 00:27:03.416
to track your exercise,
like running, right?

00:27:04.286 --> 00:27:06.806
So why do I need to keep
monitoring the location

00:27:06.806 --> 00:27:07.376
of my device?

00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:08.526
It doesn't make sense.

00:27:09.426 --> 00:27:13.016
So let's take a look to see what
the location instrument can tell

00:27:13.016 --> 00:27:14.986
us and how we can
identify the line of code

00:27:15.226 --> 00:27:16.536
to improve the situation.

00:27:17.826 --> 00:27:21.876
So I will next click
the location instrument,

00:27:22.646 --> 00:27:24.366
and I say restart.

00:27:25.346 --> 00:27:26.436
Then you are trying to bring

00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:35.906
up the instrument,
launch an app for me.

00:27:35.906 --> 00:27:38.696
Okay. So let me redo
import photo again.

00:27:39.426 --> 00:27:43.186
Set the reading.

00:27:43.826 --> 00:27:44.996
There you go.

00:27:45.846 --> 00:27:48.216
Okay. So on the screen,
you will see this.

00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:50.446
This is the location activity.

00:27:50.966 --> 00:27:53.936
It keeps going on and
on without stopping.

00:27:54.336 --> 00:27:55.526
But where is it?

00:27:55.606 --> 00:27:58.066
Where do we introduce this?

00:27:58.066 --> 00:28:00.026
Take a look at this.

00:28:00.386 --> 00:28:04.206
Go to extended detail and see.

00:28:04.456 --> 00:28:09.756
Oh, okay, it's this part
-- request location.

00:28:10.136 --> 00:28:12.626
That's how we request
for location service.

00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:22.436
So let me stop this,
go back to Xcode,

00:28:22.926 --> 00:28:25.166
and search for request location.

00:28:26.466 --> 00:28:29.306
Okay. It's already here.

00:28:29.886 --> 00:28:32.506
So what is the request
looking to do?

00:28:32.896 --> 00:28:34.366
First of all, you
are trying to set

00:28:34.366 --> 00:28:36.046
up the confirm view controller.

00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:42.606
In this piece of code,
you are trying to set up,

00:28:42.786 --> 00:28:44.076
create a location manager.

00:28:45.346 --> 00:28:48.216
Then you are will call
start updating location.

00:28:49.006 --> 00:28:53.036
So after this line, what will
happen is location service will

00:28:53.096 --> 00:28:56.696
periodically push the
location update to us

00:28:56.996 --> 00:29:00.816
through a callback,
which is over here.

00:29:02.766 --> 00:29:04.726
So in the callback, let's take
a look -- what does it do?

00:29:05.846 --> 00:29:08.046
First thing is you are
trying to see, okay,

00:29:08.596 --> 00:29:11.846
if there is anything
updated here, if it's zero,

00:29:11.846 --> 00:29:14.086
that's invalid, so we
just ignore it, return.

00:29:15.366 --> 00:29:17.536
Then we will store it, we say,

00:29:17.806 --> 00:29:21.026
whether location is
horizontal accuracy is actually

00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:22.756
up to our standard,
up to our expectation.

00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:24.216
If not, we return.

00:29:25.476 --> 00:29:26.916
If so, then we are trying

00:29:26.916 --> 00:29:30.026
to handle location inside
the confirm view controller.

00:29:30.806 --> 00:29:31.746
And then you return.

00:29:32.706 --> 00:29:35.806
And this callback routine will
be repeated again and again

00:29:35.806 --> 00:29:38.466
and again, every time
when we receive a callback

00:29:38.466 --> 00:29:39.556
from the location service.

00:29:40.276 --> 00:29:41.166
Push doesn't look nice.

00:29:41.776 --> 00:29:42.516
So what we should do?

00:29:43.176 --> 00:29:45.386
The thing we should do
is we should stop it

00:29:46.446 --> 00:29:47.426
when we have a value.

00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:51.026
Like this line.

00:29:51.696 --> 00:29:56.796
So we say when we get
a value updating --

00:29:56.796 --> 00:29:59.206
location update,
we should stop it.

00:30:00.246 --> 00:30:02.986
So let's take a look
and launch it again

00:30:03.306 --> 00:30:05.206
and see what the energy
gauge can tell us.

00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:09.746
What I expect to see is after
I receive the first time a

00:30:09.746 --> 00:30:12.706
successful location update,
I should stop the location,

00:30:12.706 --> 00:30:14.906
and location service should
not be on and on forever.

00:30:15.486 --> 00:30:18.506
Let's wait for it
to be launched.

00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:25.833
Hmmm.

00:30:27.206 --> 00:30:31.106
Okay. Go to the iOS
energy gauge.

00:30:32.076 --> 00:30:34.096
So let me try to
import a photo again.

00:30:35.936 --> 00:30:37.366
Select a photo from a gallery.

00:30:38.226 --> 00:30:39.016
Set a reading.

00:30:40.896 --> 00:30:43.646
Okay. Location, one second,
two seconds, three seconds,

00:30:43.686 --> 00:30:45.226
four seconds, and it's gone.

00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:49.936
This is an immediate improvement
after just one line of code.

00:30:50.836 --> 00:30:52.996
You can think about
the scenario over here.

00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:56.066
So if the app has been
turned on for a long time,

00:30:56.816 --> 00:30:59.876
imagine how much energy you
can save just by doing one line

00:30:59.876 --> 00:31:01.686
of code, which is amazing.

00:31:02.816 --> 00:31:06.056
So let's give more
try on Energy Buddy

00:31:06.056 --> 00:31:09.246
to see what will happen next
time when we import another one.

00:31:10.676 --> 00:31:13.166
Okay. I import another one.

00:31:13.946 --> 00:31:17.486
And I see the location has
been up for four seconds,

00:31:18.256 --> 00:31:21.806
but this time, I notice
the big thing here is

00:31:22.596 --> 00:31:23.486
networking service.

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:25.746
This doesn't look nice.

00:31:26.186 --> 00:31:29.156
The reason Energy Buddy wants
to hit the networking service

00:31:29.156 --> 00:31:31.176
because it wants to get
the weather information.

00:31:31.676 --> 00:31:34.946
But I just did a query
like two minutes ago,

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:36.956
so the weather shouldn't change

00:31:36.956 --> 00:31:39.016
that much during the
past two minutes, right?

00:31:40.096 --> 00:31:42.386
Even for an hour, I would say,

00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:44.216
the weather may not
change that much.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.086
So what is the purpose
if we want

00:31:46.086 --> 00:31:49.776
to redo the networking although
we already have earlier request

00:31:49.916 --> 00:31:50.926
that is two minutes ago?

00:31:51.406 --> 00:31:56.586
So let's go directly to the code
and see how we can fix this.

00:31:56.776 --> 00:31:58.846
So the place where
we actually request

00:31:58.846 --> 00:32:02.266
for location is inside
the weather file.

00:32:02.266 --> 00:32:05.916
And there's a function
called Fetch if Missing.

00:32:06.316 --> 00:32:07.646
So let's take a look
what does it do.

00:32:09.176 --> 00:32:11.376
In the first part, we were
trying to set some parameters

00:32:11.376 --> 00:32:16.246
like date, URL based
on the query URL for --

00:32:16.336 --> 00:32:18.446
based on the device location
and the current date --

00:32:19.326 --> 00:32:20.576
and whether I have
done this kind

00:32:20.576 --> 00:32:22.226
of query within today or not.

00:32:22.786 --> 00:32:26.836
And you will store the source
ID for the location coordinate,

00:32:26.836 --> 00:32:30.526
and you will set a constant
that is exactly the number

00:32:30.526 --> 00:32:32.446
of seconds within the hour.

00:32:33.366 --> 00:32:35.536
So the first if we are
try to go do is we say

00:32:35.966 --> 00:32:37.796
if we have done the
query for today

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:42.386
and the data manager already
has the weather fetched

00:32:42.656 --> 00:32:44.946
since the last time we queried,
that is like three minutes ago,

00:32:45.486 --> 00:32:48.936
then we say we just return.

00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:52.026
Next is if we don't do it today

00:32:53.056 --> 00:32:55.736
and data manager already
has the weather fetched,

00:32:55.986 --> 00:32:56.816
then we also return.

00:32:57.376 --> 00:33:02.166
If none of these two
situations have been satisfied,

00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:08.206
then we will try to set up a
task based on the location,

00:33:08.206 --> 00:33:12.826
based on the date, and we will
try to download it over here.

00:33:13.056 --> 00:33:14.026
So what's going wrong there?

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:20.056
The reason it's doing wrong
is actually inside this gauge

00:33:20.276 --> 00:33:21.296
over here.

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:27.146
So I will add in another
situation like this,

00:33:27.846 --> 00:33:29.896
to say if I have done this today

00:33:29.956 --> 00:33:33.326
and the previous fetch is
actually within an hour,

00:33:33.616 --> 00:33:34.776
then I will not do it again.

00:33:36.246 --> 00:33:40.406
So let's launch it again and see
how we can see the improvement

00:33:40.846 --> 00:33:42.856
inside energy gauge.

00:33:43.406 --> 00:33:44.966
So what we expect
to see is this.

00:33:45.306 --> 00:33:48.336
Because we've already done our
fetch, like five minutes ago,

00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:52.346
we should not see any networking
every time when we are trying

00:33:52.346 --> 00:33:54.646
to import a photo again
within the next hour.

00:33:55.146 --> 00:33:57.156
Let's take a look whether
energy gauge will agree

00:33:57.156 --> 00:33:58.766
with my theory here.

00:34:01.046 --> 00:34:02.386
Okay. It's up.

00:34:03.726 --> 00:34:08.755
So I am trying to
import a photo,

00:34:10.016 --> 00:34:14.775
select a picture from a gallery.

00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:17.176
Set the reading.

00:34:17.406 --> 00:34:19.485
So I see the location.

00:34:19.876 --> 00:34:21.366
It's been for four
seconds like before.

00:34:22.176 --> 00:34:24.366
But magically, all the
networking is gone.

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:27.326
This is exactly what we expect.

00:34:27.926 --> 00:34:29.366
So this is another good way

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:32.166
for the energy efficiency
of our Energy Buddy.

00:34:33.706 --> 00:34:35.186
So besides the foreground,

00:34:35.766 --> 00:34:39.766
Energy Buddy can also consume
significant battery even

00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:41.176
on the background.

00:34:41.176 --> 00:34:45.286
So let's take a look at what
the energy gauge can tell us

00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:47.045
when Energy Buddy is
actually on the background.

00:34:47.806 --> 00:34:49.356
We put Energy Buddy
in the background

00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:53.866
by hitting the Home button.

00:34:55.116 --> 00:35:00.096
So what we see is over here.

00:35:02.176 --> 00:35:03.636
We see lots of, lots

00:35:03.636 --> 00:35:07.316
of background activities
of Energy Buddy.

00:35:08.676 --> 00:35:12.276
And that means that
whenever Energy Buddy is

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:17.246
on the background, the
device cannot go to sleep,

00:35:17.676 --> 00:35:18.986
which will consume
significant power

00:35:18.986 --> 00:35:21.436
because there is a fixed cost
to keep the device awake.

00:35:22.716 --> 00:35:25.476
This doesn't make sense because
Energy Buddy doesn't need

00:35:25.476 --> 00:35:26.716
to do anything on
the background.

00:35:27.736 --> 00:35:29.136
So what's going wrong here?

00:35:29.766 --> 00:35:33.406
Let us go to the callback

00:35:34.926 --> 00:35:37.536
when we actually go
to the background.

00:35:37.536 --> 00:35:39.716
Here is the code.

00:35:39.716 --> 00:35:41.966
What does it do?

00:35:43.126 --> 00:35:43.846
It does the following.

00:35:43.956 --> 00:35:46.476
You are trying to set out
background task identifier,

00:35:46.476 --> 00:35:50.616
and they will do one thing,
archive to data manager,

00:35:50.826 --> 00:35:53.626
which will store all the
changes to data manager,

00:35:53.886 --> 00:35:57.106
and they will say wait for
input, and we will code

00:35:57.106 --> 00:35:59.096
in background task when
it is actually done.

00:35:59.626 --> 00:36:01.676
Does it make sense?

00:36:02.446 --> 00:36:03.906
No. Why not?

00:36:04.756 --> 00:36:07.376
Because our app is always
on in the background, right?

00:36:07.606 --> 00:36:10.676
So how come users
can actually interact

00:36:10.676 --> 00:36:11.796
with Energy Buddies
through the UI?

00:36:12.586 --> 00:36:16.556
So there has been no input at
all, and we are waiting for it.

00:36:16.866 --> 00:36:17.696
This doesn't look nice.

00:36:18.546 --> 00:36:25.926
So what we should do is
we shouldn't wait for it.

00:36:26.836 --> 00:36:31.476
Instead, we should do
something like this.

00:36:32.276 --> 00:36:36.356
After we archive the data to
data manager, we will call

00:36:36.356 --> 00:36:37.986
in background task immediately

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:42.396
and invalidate the
background task identifier.

00:36:42.636 --> 00:36:45.976
Again, let's launch
Energy Buddy again

00:36:45.976 --> 00:36:48.026
and see what the energy
gauge can tell us.

00:36:49.086 --> 00:36:50.056
What we expect is this.

00:36:50.806 --> 00:36:54.646
After we just saw all the
changes in data manager,

00:36:54.936 --> 00:36:57.436
it will directly
just quit itself

00:36:57.436 --> 00:36:58.996
and release the control
to the assistant.

00:36:59.126 --> 00:36:59.786
It will not stay

00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:07.866
in the background all
the time like before.

00:37:07.906 --> 00:37:10.976
Okay. Go to energy gauge.

00:37:11.506 --> 00:37:14.936
Put the Energy Buddy
in the background.

00:37:16.036 --> 00:37:17.676
So we are in the
background one second,

00:37:17.766 --> 00:37:21.106
two seconds, and it's gone.

00:37:21.336 --> 00:37:22.416
So this is another big win.

00:37:23.186 --> 00:37:27.396
So keep in mind that, with
very simple fix like I just did

00:37:27.516 --> 00:37:30.526
on the stage, you can see
significant improvements,

00:37:30.876 --> 00:37:33.646
and Abhinav will introduce
you because we carry

00:37:33.646 --> 00:37:36.296
on a couple hours or even a day

00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:38.746
with significant
battery improvement.

00:37:39.456 --> 00:37:42.646
So this concludes my demo, and
let me hand it back to Abhinav.

00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:47.546
[ Applause ]

00:37:48.046 --> 00:37:49.316
>> ABHINAV PATHAK:
Thank you, Pai-Han.

00:37:49.606 --> 00:37:51.126
That was a great demo.

00:37:51.416 --> 00:37:52.256
Back on the slides.

00:37:52.256 --> 00:37:53.196
So let's conclude this talk.

00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:55.376
Let's see what happened during
this demo, a quick summary.

00:37:55.876 --> 00:37:58.416
We started with the Energy
Buddy, inefficient code.

00:37:58.416 --> 00:38:02.456
We ran it as the user would use
it and let's see what happened.

00:38:02.456 --> 00:38:03.636
Everything is lighted here.

00:38:03.866 --> 00:38:06.726
Bad, bad, really bad,
the impact is very high,

00:38:07.116 --> 00:38:09.676
and your app will come very
high in the battery UI.

00:38:09.676 --> 00:38:10.946
How did we fix it?

00:38:10.946 --> 00:38:16.326
We went to location, and we
said hey, location has started.

00:38:16.326 --> 00:38:16.766
Then stop.

00:38:17.206 --> 00:38:19.706
One line of change,
boom, location stops.

00:38:20.166 --> 00:38:22.606
Let's see before and
after how does it look?

00:38:23.466 --> 00:38:26.516
If you focus on location
timeline,

00:38:26.516 --> 00:38:28.906
we see location is
on all the time.

00:38:29.406 --> 00:38:31.106
Afterwards, location is on only

00:38:31.106 --> 00:38:34.376
when it is actually required
whenever a photo is imported.

00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:36.746
Let's go to networking.

00:38:36.986 --> 00:38:40.006
What we did was we were getting
weather information all the time

00:38:40.106 --> 00:38:43.946
whenever a new photo was
imported, and that is not good.

00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:45.386
We wanted to cut
down the transfer,

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:46.786
and we put a very simple block.

00:38:46.786 --> 00:38:49.916
Hey, if this is recently
called, don't do that.

00:38:50.006 --> 00:38:51.456
We don't need the new
information again.

00:38:52.276 --> 00:38:54.696
What impact did that
have on the energy gauge?

00:38:55.016 --> 00:38:57.446
Two photos, again,
before and after.

00:38:57.736 --> 00:38:59.566
And if you focus on
the networking part,

00:38:59.886 --> 00:39:01.796
networking is highlighted
for a long time.

00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:04.766
The red bars on the top are
highlighted all the time,

00:39:04.796 --> 00:39:06.326
saying networking
hardware is up.

00:39:06.736 --> 00:39:09.376
It's a huge amount of time
during the usage of the app.

00:39:09.856 --> 00:39:12.616
At the bottom, we just
do networking once, boom,

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:15.536
after that, it's recently
called, it won't be done again.

00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:19.976
What about the background
session?

00:39:20.106 --> 00:39:23.516
When we went to background, we
stored our state into database

00:39:23.856 --> 00:39:25.976
and said hey, let's
wait for the user input.

00:39:26.346 --> 00:39:27.126
Not a good place to do.

00:39:27.126 --> 00:39:29.196
User is in the going to do
any input at that point.

00:39:30.016 --> 00:39:31.276
Very simple fix.

00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:33.076
We say don't wait
for user input.

00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:34.916
Just call the task
completion handler.

00:39:35.306 --> 00:39:37.646
Tell the system hey,
I am done, suspend me,

00:39:37.646 --> 00:39:40.176
let the system go to sleep.

00:39:40.176 --> 00:39:42.286
How does energy gauge look
like before and after?

00:39:42.286 --> 00:39:44.036
Let's focus on the
background line.

00:39:44.626 --> 00:39:47.416
Background is up all
the time in the top.

00:39:47.416 --> 00:39:50.546
At the bottom, the moment
we have done the archiving

00:39:50.546 --> 00:39:53.196
to the database, the
background task is done.

00:39:53.546 --> 00:39:54.316
We are suspended.

00:39:55.056 --> 00:39:59.696
Awesome. Let's take a look at
overall code before and after.

00:40:00.306 --> 00:40:02.316
Before, you see everything
lighted up.

00:40:02.626 --> 00:40:05.406
If this is happening to
your app, this is a problem.

00:40:06.076 --> 00:40:08.876
After is we are doing
the same utility,

00:40:08.876 --> 00:40:12.036
we are giving the same utility
to the user, same experience,

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:15.336
but very, very little
amount of load

00:40:15.336 --> 00:40:16.916
on the hardware in
terms of energy.

00:40:18.896 --> 00:40:21.736
Probably the most important
slide, as we promised you

00:40:21.736 --> 00:40:23.956
in the starting, if your
app is coming at the top,

00:40:24.306 --> 00:40:27.466
please do the changes and you
will see your app actually going

00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:28.286
at the bottom of the UI.

00:40:28.286 --> 00:40:31.906
What we did, we took two
iPhone 6 fresh installs,

00:40:32.416 --> 00:40:34.276
on one of them installed
inefficient code,

00:40:34.606 --> 00:40:37.246
on the second installed the
code with all the fixes,

00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:40.066
took both of them exact
same amount of work,

00:40:40.066 --> 00:40:43.226
while running other applications
as well, same amount of load

00:40:43.226 --> 00:40:45.466
in terms of all application,
in terms of Energy Buddy

00:40:45.766 --> 00:40:46.716
and other applications.

00:40:47.436 --> 00:40:53.506
What we found: the fixed code
consumed 50 percent less energy,

00:40:54.266 --> 00:40:55.746
including display energy,

00:40:56.126 --> 00:40:57.996
which is exactly the
same in both the apps.

00:40:59.306 --> 00:41:02.446
Battery UI you see right
on the top, 28 percent.

00:41:02.866 --> 00:41:06.036
And with optimized
code, it goes way down.

00:41:06.646 --> 00:41:09.016
User is getting exactly
the same thing.

00:41:10.696 --> 00:41:15.406
To summarize this talk, battery
life is really, really important

00:41:15.616 --> 00:41:17.716
to have a good customer
experience.

00:41:18.276 --> 00:41:20.116
Design your app with
three things in mind --

00:41:20.386 --> 00:41:23.366
do it never/do it less,
do it more efficiently,

00:41:23.626 --> 00:41:25.896
do it at a better time.

00:41:26.076 --> 00:41:28.246
Be a very considerate
background application.

00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:31.276
Please try out the
new debug tools.

00:41:31.536 --> 00:41:32.276
We have our labs.

00:41:32.276 --> 00:41:33.636
I will give details right now.

00:41:34.246 --> 00:41:35.776
Check out the new
Energy Guide we have.

00:41:35.936 --> 00:41:37.446
It contains all the
information we talked

00:41:37.446 --> 00:41:39.296
about in this talk and more.

00:41:40.316 --> 00:41:41.746
Bring your apps to
the Power Lab.

00:41:43.616 --> 00:41:44.466
Some more information

00:41:44.586 --> 00:41:46.466
about where you can
find the Energy Guides.

00:41:48.296 --> 00:41:49.976
Technical support for this talk.

00:41:51.466 --> 00:41:53.146
Finally, the related
sessions for these talks,

00:41:53.146 --> 00:41:56.186
which are talking about
a few concepts we talked,

00:41:56.186 --> 00:41:57.006
but in more detail.

00:41:58.816 --> 00:41:59.886
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
