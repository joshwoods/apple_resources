00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:31.896
[Applause]

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:32.996
>> JAMIE WOOD: Thank you.

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:35.206
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:37.126
Welcome to session 717.

00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:39.796
My name is Jamie Wood
and I'm here today

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:41.046
with my colleague, Tommy Pauly.

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:43.766
We are Network Engineers in
the Core OS networking group

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:48.116
at Apple, and we are excited
to tell you about what is new

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:51.526
in Network Extension and VPN.

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:55.576
So you may be wondering what
is Network Extension Framework?

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:57.956
What capabilities does
it have to offer to me

00:00:58.176 --> 00:00:59.526
for use in my application?

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:04.186
Network Extension Framework
provide APIs to use in your app

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.796
to customize and extend the
Core networking features

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:08.896
of Apple's platforms.

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:12.086
Let's look at specific
examples of kinds

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:15.006
of apps you can create using
the Network Extension APIs.

00:01:16.196 --> 00:01:20.696
If your company makes Wi-Fi
Hotspots that are deployed

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:24.656
in public places like hotels,
airports, coffee shops,

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:28.626
you can use the any Hotspot
helper API to create apps

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:30.346
that connect to your
Wi-Fi Hotspots.

00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:34.936
If your company creates
a personal VPN service

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:38.966
that your users use to securely
browse the Internet you can use

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:42.466
the NEVPN manager API to
create apps that connect

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.806
to your personal VPN service.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:49.146
If your company creates a
remote access VPN server,

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.496
you can use the any tunnel
provider family of APIs

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:55.026
to create apps that
connect to your VPN server.

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:59.996
And finally if your school
creates a network content

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:02.026
filtering solution
for use by schools

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:03.896
to protect the students'
Internet browsing,

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:07.696
you can use the any filter
provider family of APIs

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:12.366
to create apps that
filter network content.

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:20.256
So these are all of the Network
Extension APIs that we are going

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:22.066
to talk about today
during the session.

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:27.176
So let's go ahead and dive into
the any Hotspot helper API.

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:36.666
So the any Hotspot helper
API is used to create apps

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:38.256
that connect to Wi-Fi Hotspots.

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:42.106
Now, some of you may be aware

00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:44.316
that there actually are
already APIs that you can use

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:46.496
to create apps that
connect to Wi-Fi Hotspots.

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:50.886
The CNSetSupportedSSIDs and
CNMarkPortalOnline APIs,

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:53.386
but they have limitations.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:58.796
One problem is that the
Hotspot list you can pass

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:02.166
to CNSetSupportedSSIDs
is limited in size.

00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:06.126
If you have a Global Network
of Wi-Fi Hotspots you're trying

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:08.316
to connect your app
to you can quickly run

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:09.506
into the size limitation.

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:13.026
Another draw-back
is that in order

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.596
to call CNMarkPortalOnline,

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:17.086
users have to manually
run your application.

00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:20.866
This is exacerbated by the
fact that there's no indication

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.826
to the user they
need to do this.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.946
It is not a great
user experience.

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.856
The users don't know that
they have to go into the app

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.446
to connect to the Wi-Fi Hotspot.

00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:34.146
So we've introduced the
any Hotspot helper API

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:36.176
to address some of
these limitations.

00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:39.926
So the way this works is
you first register your app

00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:41.616
with the system as
a Hotspot helper.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:47.076
Then as the device comes
within range of Wi-Fi networks,

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:50.446
scanning for Wi-Fi networks or
the user selects a Wi-Fi network

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:55.036
to connect to, the system will
call into your app, run your app

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:56.806
in the background,
call into your app

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:58.996
and give your app
the opportunity

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:01.376
to claim the Wi-Fi
Hotspot with a level

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:04.036
of confidence, high,
medium or low.

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:07.606
If you claim a Hotspot with
a high level of confidence,

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:09.906
the system will call you

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:11.526
to actually perform
the authentication

00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:12.566
with the Wi-Fi Hotspot.

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:15.416
And it will periodically
call you

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:17.726
to maintain the authentication
session.

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:22.026
The Hotspot helper
API also allows you

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:27.066
to annotate Wi-Fi networks that
show up in the Wi-Fi manager

00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:32.186
in the settings app and you can
annotate these Wi-Fi networks

00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:35.406
with the name of your app
or the name of your company.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.806
So that's the any
Hotspot helper API.

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:40.636
You can use this
API to create apps

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:43.026
that seamlessly connect
to Wi-Fi Hotspots.

00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:47.686
Next let's look at
the NEVPN manager API.

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:51.386
You can use this API to
create apps that connect

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:53.806
to a personal VPN service
that users will use

00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:55.386
to securely browse the Internet.

00:04:56.006 --> 00:05:01.686
Now, the NEVPN manager
API is not new in iOS 9.

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:04.866
We introduced this API in iOS 8.

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:10.266
We made some enhancements to the
API and made the API available

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:11.866
on OS X, OS X El Capitan.

00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:16.876
The way this works is you
can use the NEVPN manager API

00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:19.536
to configure and control
the built-in IPSEC client

00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:20.956
on the platform.

00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:25.806
You can create a single
personal VPN configuration.

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:28.136
I'll talk about what a
personal VPN configuration is

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:29.236
in a few minutes here.

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:34.326
The built in IPSEC
clients supports IKE v1

00:05:34.326 --> 00:05:36.616
and IKE v2 key exchange
protocols.

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:37.646
You can use either of these.

00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:43.336
You can configure the VPN
to connect automatically

00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:44.686
under certain network
conditions.

00:05:45.316 --> 00:05:51.226
New in iOS 9 and
OS X El Capitan,

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.616
you can configure http proxies

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:57.136
for http traffic
traversing your VPN tunnel.

00:05:57.706 --> 00:06:03.936
And personal VPN configurations
coexist and cooperate

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:05.796
with enterprise VPN
configurations.

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:09.066
Suppose the user is
using your app to connect

00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:10.436
to your personal VPN service,

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:13.446
and they are securely
browsing the Internet and want

00:06:13.786 --> 00:06:17.276
to access something in their
company's internal network.

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:23.046
So they go ahead and connect
to their enterprise VPN and all

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:24.696
of the traffic that's destined

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:26.206
for those internal
resources will go ahead

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:27.796
and use that enterprise VPN.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.426
But everything else
that is not going

00:06:30.426 --> 00:06:32.226
to use the enterprise
VPN will continue to go

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.286
through the personal VPN.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.116
Personal VPN remains connected

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:37.546
and will continue
to tunnel traffic.

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:43.076
So there's a brief run
down of the features

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:45.096
that the NEVPN manager
API provides.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:49.746
Another way that we've enhanced
NEVPN manager is we've enhanced

00:06:49.746 --> 00:06:51.716
our IKE v2 protocol support.

00:06:52.426 --> 00:06:55.316
We think that's a great
tunneling protocol

00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:58.096
and made it better
in this release.

00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:01.076
We now support MOBIKE.

00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:07.306
We will now seamlessly
transition your IKE v2 tunnel

00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:09.426
from one network
interface to the other.

00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:13.016
For example, if your
tunnel is connected

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.406
over the Wi-Fi interface but
the user walks out of range

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.766
of that Wi-Fi network, so
now the device switches

00:07:18.766 --> 00:07:20.496
over to use the cellular
interface,

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:23.116
the IKE v2 tunnel will
seamlessly transition over.

00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:26.056
Very cool.

00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:30.196
[Applause]

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:33.266
>> JAMIE WOOD: We now have full
support for IPv6, both inside

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:35.106
and outside of the
IKE v2 tunnel.

00:07:36.236 --> 00:07:39.096
We now support IKE
fragmentation.

00:07:39.096 --> 00:07:43.456
This allows the IKE v2 tunnel to
work more reliably in a variety

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:44.396
of network environments.

00:07:44.956 --> 00:07:48.166
We have IKE redirect
supports allowing you

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.686
to load balance your
IKE v2 server.

00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:54.166
So with all of these
enhancements it is now better

00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:55.116
than ever.

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:56.416
IKE v2 works better than ever.

00:07:56.716 --> 00:07:59.466
It works more reliably
in a wider number

00:07:59.466 --> 00:08:02.746
of network environments.

00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:04.846
So now let's take a
look at some code.

00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:06.796
How do you use the
NEVPN manager API?

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:08.866
I want to show you some code

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:12.616
that will create this
personal VPN configuration.

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:19.196
So each app that uses the
NEVPN manager API gets access

00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:21.306
to a single personal
VPN configuration,

00:08:21.336 --> 00:08:24.606
which is represented by a
single NEVPN manager object.

00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:28.766
So first I get a reference to
my shared manager object and all

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:30.876
of the VPN configurations
on the system are stored

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:32.456
in the network extension
preferences.

00:08:33.035 --> 00:08:36.145
Before I can work with my
configuration, in my code,

00:08:36.145 --> 00:08:39.015
I need to load it from those
preferences using this load

00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:40.856
from preferences with
completion handler call.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:45.236
In the completion handler,
the first thing I want

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:48.226
to do is check and see if my
configuration exists or not.

00:08:48.776 --> 00:08:51.966
I look at the protocol
property on the manager object.

00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:54.646
If that's nil, it means I
don't have a configuration yet.

00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:56.006
I want to set one up.

00:08:56.006 --> 00:09:00.266
I'll configure a IKE v2
configuration here and I fill it

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:04.876
out with all the IKE v2 specific
configuration parameters.

00:09:05.876 --> 00:09:09.216
When I'm done with that I'll
set the protocol property

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:13.056
on the manager object and I'll
enable the VPN configuration.

00:09:13.146 --> 00:09:16.076
You can only have one personal
VPN configuration enabled

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:17.196
on the system at a time.

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:22.066
And then when I'm all done,
go ahead and call save

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:24.686
to preferences to
save the configuration

00:09:24.686 --> 00:09:26.106
into the network
extension preferences

00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:27.776
and apply the configuration
of the system

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:29.226
so they can actually be used.

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:33.156
From here you can use
the API to manually start

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:36.366
and stop the VPN tunnel
and introspect the status

00:09:36.366 --> 00:09:38.716
of the VPN tunnel to know
when you're connected,

00:09:38.856 --> 00:09:39.826
disconnected, et cetera.

00:09:41.216 --> 00:09:44.986
But for great user experience
another thing to do is

00:09:45.076 --> 00:09:47.116
to configure connect on-demand.

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:50.926
So with connect on-demand you
can set up rules that state

00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:53.326
when the VPN should
connect automatically.

00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:57.816
So, for this example, I'm going
to go ahead and set up a rule

00:09:58.106 --> 00:10:01.316
that says that my VPN should
connect whenever the device is

00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:02.256
on a Wi-Fi network.

00:10:03.796 --> 00:10:04.766
So the first thing to do,

00:10:04.766 --> 00:10:08.036
I'm going to create an
on-demand rule connect object.

00:10:08.626 --> 00:10:10.606
So this is a rule that says

00:10:11.046 --> 00:10:15.836
when this rule matches,
connect the VPN.

00:10:16.086 --> 00:10:19.196
Next I'm going to set an
interface type match condition

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:20.016
on my rule.

00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:23.546
So it says when the device
is on a particular type

00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:26.096
of network interface,
then this rule will match.

00:10:26.096 --> 00:10:27.406
I'm go to set that to Wi-Fi.

00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:30.516
This rule will match when the
device is on a Wi-Fi network.

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.066
Go ahead and set the
on-demand rules array

00:10:34.146 --> 00:10:36.036
to contain this new rule

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:38.876
and save the result
to the preferences.

00:10:39.616 --> 00:10:42.416
So now my VPN will connect
automatically whenever the

00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:43.756
device is on a Wi-Fi network.

00:10:44.396 --> 00:10:48.976
Okay. So that's the
NEVPN manager API.

00:10:49.126 --> 00:10:51.976
You can use this API to
create apps that connect

00:10:51.976 --> 00:10:53.836
to your personal VPN service.

00:10:54.346 --> 00:10:56.886
Let's go ahead and talk

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:59.226
about the any tunnel
provider family of APIs.

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.306
You use these APIs to
create apps that connect

00:11:02.686 --> 00:11:04.506
to enterprise VPN servers.

00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:11.756
So the way this works is
you create a custom VPN

00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:12.686
protocol provider.

00:11:13.316 --> 00:11:16.136
This is essentially the
client side implementation

00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:19.216
of your own custom
tunneling protocol.

00:11:19.466 --> 00:11:23.466
These protocol providers
run as app extensions.

00:11:23.646 --> 00:11:26.246
They run in the background
handling background traffic.

00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:31.126
You can create two types
of tunnel providers.

00:11:31.126 --> 00:11:32.906
You can create a
Packet Tunnel Provider.

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:36.246
These tunnel traffic
at the IP layer.

00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:40.886
You can create, or you can
create an App Proxy provider

00:11:40.886 --> 00:11:43.016
that tunnels traffic
at the app layer.

00:11:45.336 --> 00:11:48.986
The tunnel provider family
also has APIs that allow you

00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:52.266
to configure and control your
protocol provider from your app.

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:54.926
So similar to the VPN manager
API where you can configure

00:11:54.926 --> 00:11:57.946
and control the IPSEC
client, these APIs allow you

00:11:57.946 --> 00:12:01.026
to configure and control your
own custom protocol provider.

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:08.756
Let's take a closer look at the
NEPacket Tunnel provider API.

00:12:09.276 --> 00:12:09.976
How does this work?

00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:14.846
So suppose we have an NEPacket
Tunnel Provider here running

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:18.256
on the system and it's
connected to a VPN server

00:12:18.256 --> 00:12:21.546
and providing a tunnel
to some internal network.

00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:27.516
So you've got an app that's
trying to connect to a resource

00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:28.346
in the internal network.

00:12:29.496 --> 00:12:31.136
So the app will open
up a network connection

00:12:31.136 --> 00:12:35.126
that will create a socket and
create a TCP/IP connection

00:12:36.026 --> 00:12:39.626
and the packets for that TCP/IP
connection will be routed

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:41.066
to the UTUN0 interface.

00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:45.636
This is a virtual interface, so
instead of sending the packets

00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:49.146
out over the physical
network it will divert them

00:12:49.456 --> 00:12:50.786
to the NEPacket Tunnel Provider.

00:12:51.756 --> 00:12:54.736
The Packet Tunnel Provider
then can take the packets,

00:12:54.736 --> 00:12:57.556
encapsulate them in
your tunneling protocol,

00:12:58.046 --> 00:13:00.036
send them over to
the tunneling server.

00:13:00.036 --> 00:13:02.326
The tunneling server
will decapsulate them,

00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:04.266
inject those packets
into the internal network

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:06.326
and they will be delivered
to the ultimate destination,

00:13:07.026 --> 00:13:09.666
and the return packets will
be encapsulated by the server,

00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:12.966
sent back to the provider,
the provider decapsulates them

00:13:13.396 --> 00:13:16.296
and injects them back into the
networking stack via the UTUN0

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.356
interface, they'll
be delivered back

00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:21.076
up through the TCP/IP
stack to the application.

00:13:21.826 --> 00:13:24.386
This is the basic
way that this works.

00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:28.226
NEPacket Tunnel Provider
has a lot of control

00:13:28.226 --> 00:13:29.646
over the UTUN0 interface.

00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:32.766
Most importantly, it
can specify the routes.

00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:38.066
The IP destinations that will
be routed to the UTUN0 interface

00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:38.786
and through the tunnel.

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:42.716
The Packet Tunnel Provider can
specify the virtual address

00:13:42.716 --> 00:13:45.696
to assign to the
interface, as well as the DNS

00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:47.796
and proxy settings
that should be used

00:13:47.796 --> 00:13:51.776
for traffic routed
through the tunnel.

00:13:52.256 --> 00:13:55.036
So next Tommy Pauly is going to
come up and give us a brief demo

00:13:55.346 --> 00:13:57.356
of how to create an
NEPacket Tunnel Provider.

00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:02.696
[Applause]

00:14:03.196 --> 00:14:05.106
>> TOM PAULY: Thank you, Jamie.

00:14:05.106 --> 00:14:08.756
We are excited to have you
write your own custom VPN

00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:09.796
protocol providers.

00:14:10.206 --> 00:14:14.026
To help you do that I want
to show you quickly the steps

00:14:14.026 --> 00:14:16.426
that are involved in building
a Packet Tunnel Provider.

00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:19.576
I'm going to start
with an Xcode project

00:14:19.576 --> 00:14:21.946
in which I have an app already.

00:14:21.946 --> 00:14:25.826
It is using the manager APIs
to create a configuration.

00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:28.096
So we are going to skip over
that part and we're going

00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:30.706
to assume that I have a
framework that is implemented

00:14:30.706 --> 00:14:33.626
to do my own custom
protocol negotiation.

00:14:33.886 --> 00:14:36.936
I want to show how to build
this new extension and kind

00:14:36.936 --> 00:14:38.076
of put all the pieces together.

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:38.746
All right.

00:14:40.716 --> 00:14:43.686
So here I have my project.

00:14:44.436 --> 00:14:46.206
The first thing you need

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:48.386
to do is add a new
target for your extension.

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:53.806
To get this, in OS X El
Capitan we've added it

00:14:53.896 --> 00:14:56.856
into the network
extension framework.

00:14:57.896 --> 00:15:02.616
So on your system if you go to
system, library, Frameworks,

00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:06.166
network extension
Framework and you go

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:08.916
into the resources folder,
we've provided an installer

00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:12.476
for the templates for
this, these target types.

00:15:13.436 --> 00:15:14.486
So you can go through
the installer.

00:15:15.676 --> 00:15:17.866
I'm going to install
it just for this user.

00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:22.416
And now I have the templates.

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:27.936
If I go into my project and
I try to create a new target,

00:15:27.996 --> 00:15:30.766
under application extensions I
now have four new target types.

00:15:31.466 --> 00:15:34.916
I have App Proxy providers
for application layer VPNs.

00:15:35.446 --> 00:15:39.166
I have two filter control
and data providers.

00:15:39.636 --> 00:15:41.316
These allow me to do content
filtering which we'll talk

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:43.806
about later and I have
Packet Tunnel Provider.

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:49.356
My protocol in this case uses
IP level tunneling for my VPN.

00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:50.776
I'll choose the Packet
Tunnel Provider.

00:15:51.276 --> 00:15:54.916
Going to write in Swift.

00:15:54.916 --> 00:16:01.446
Let's just call it
packet tunnel.

00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:03.236
Great. Now I have a new target

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:05.866
and I can start building
my VPN provider.

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:10.946
So let's jump ahead to the
actual process of writing this.

00:16:11.326 --> 00:16:13.176
My protocol happens to
be based around UDP.

00:16:13.176 --> 00:16:16.176
It uses UDP to talk
to the server

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:21.376
and tunnel traffic
from the system.

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:24.366
I have subclassed the
NEPacket Tunnel Provider class

00:16:25.466 --> 00:16:28.286
and this is the class going
to be called in my extension

00:16:28.286 --> 00:16:29.686
to start and stop my VPN.

00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:32.636
The most important
function that I'm going

00:16:32.636 --> 00:16:35.186
to overwrite here is the
start tunnel with options.

00:16:35.636 --> 00:16:37.206
This will get called
whenever the user

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:39.486
or the system automatically
wants to start your VPN.

00:16:39.486 --> 00:16:45.006
And if you notice, it calls and
passes a completion handler.

00:16:45.436 --> 00:16:48.356
This completion handler is
what you can use to call

00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:50.776
and tell the system that you
are done setting up your VPN.

00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:53.766
When you call this, the system
will know you fully connected

00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:57.206
and it's ready to go.

00:16:57.356 --> 00:17:00.736
So I mentioned already that my
protocol is based around UDP.

00:17:00.736 --> 00:17:06.656
I want to in my start create
a UDP connection to my server.

00:17:06.976 --> 00:17:11.506
In order to do this I'm going to
create an NWUDP session object.

00:17:12.016 --> 00:17:15.965
This is one of many convenience
networking APIs that we've added

00:17:16.256 --> 00:17:19.586
to the Network Extension
Framework to help you make good

00:17:20.316 --> 00:17:22.536
and very efficient connections.

00:17:23.116 --> 00:17:24.556
So UDP session allows me

00:17:24.556 --> 00:17:27.415
to create a connection
to a host name.

00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:29.496
It will do all the
DNS resolution for me

00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:33.156
and asynchronously let me
know when it's ready to go.

00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:39.546
I can do reading and writing of
multiple data grams at a time

00:17:39.546 --> 00:17:41.286
for the most efficient
connections possible.

00:17:41.786 --> 00:17:45.996
Let's implement start
tunnel with options now.

00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:50.256
The first thing I need
to do is actually figure

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:51.376
out what I'm trying
to connect to.

00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:53.816
I look at my configuration
to get my server address.

00:17:54.256 --> 00:17:56.476
This might be an IP
address or a host name.

00:17:57.066 --> 00:18:01.866
I then wrap it up in
an NW host end point.

00:18:02.186 --> 00:18:05.926
This is just a container
object that takes an address

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:08.266
or a host name and puts
it alongside a port

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:09.756
that belongs to my protocol.

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:17.376
I then call create UDP session
2 end point to start the process

00:18:17.376 --> 00:18:19.316
of doing DNS resolution

00:18:19.716 --> 00:18:21.296
and creating the
connection to my server.

00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:25.736
At this point the system starts
doing that and I am waiting

00:18:25.736 --> 00:18:30.836
for the event that I
want to read and write.

00:18:30.836 --> 00:18:34.236
I do KeyVO to watch the state
property of the UDP session

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:35.336
to get these transitions.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:39.746
So at this point I'm pretty
much done with my start call.

00:18:40.116 --> 00:18:43.556
The last thing I need to do is
save that completion handler

00:18:43.616 --> 00:18:45.466
that I got at the
beginning because I'm not

00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:48.036
yet done completing
my VPN connection.

00:18:48.946 --> 00:18:52.056
So I'm going to declare a
pending start completion.

00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:56.836
And I'm going to
save that for later.

00:18:58.256 --> 00:18:58.526
All right.

00:18:58.586 --> 00:18:59.806
So I'm going to skip
over the part

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.046
where we actually
negotiate with our server.

00:19:02.046 --> 00:19:05.046
I assume your protocol
already knows how to do that.

00:19:05.556 --> 00:19:08.656
I'm going to skip ahead to where
we have been assigned an address

00:19:08.656 --> 00:19:09.906
and other network settings.

00:19:09.906 --> 00:19:13.496
We want to apply it to the
system and let the system know

00:19:13.496 --> 00:19:14.846
that we're done bringing
up the VPN.

00:19:15.816 --> 00:19:20.716
This is just a custom
function that I wrote that says

00:19:20.776 --> 00:19:22.946
that I'm done bringing
up my connection.

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:25.926
What I'm going to do is call,

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:28.756
create NEPacket Tunnel
network settings object,

00:19:29.246 --> 00:19:30.516
and this is a bundle of settings

00:19:30.516 --> 00:19:32.086
that I can apply
into the system.

00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:35.826
I can set the IPv4 settings,

00:19:35.826 --> 00:19:38.326
I have an assigned
address and subnet.

00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:41.356
I have route settings.

00:19:41.356 --> 00:19:43.446
In this case I want to be the
default route for the system

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:47.906
but I can also have a long
list of split tunnel routes.

00:19:49.176 --> 00:19:52.436
I can define the overhead
bytes that my tunnel has.

00:19:52.436 --> 00:19:55.826
For every packet,
how much do I incur

00:19:56.246 --> 00:19:57.716
for encryption and
encapsulation.

00:19:58.086 --> 00:20:03.716
This helps the system know how
large it should send packets.

00:20:03.776 --> 00:20:05.856
And lastly, I can
set the DNS settings.

00:20:06.286 --> 00:20:09.246
I can set my assigned
DNS server or domain.

00:20:09.856 --> 00:20:12.226
To apply this to the system,

00:20:12.426 --> 00:20:15.086
I call set tunnel
network settings.

00:20:15.536 --> 00:20:17.936
I get a callback
handler when it is done

00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:21.226
and that lets me know it has
been successfully applied

00:20:21.356 --> 00:20:24.036
and I can call the start
completion handler letting the

00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:27.066
system know that I'm
done bringing up the VPN.

00:20:27.066 --> 00:20:27.636
This is great.

00:20:27.636 --> 00:20:29.256
I have a full connection up.

00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:31.846
But the thing I'm
missing is being able

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:33.326
to route traffic back and forth.

00:20:33.326 --> 00:20:38.686
I'll give you a look at
what that looks like.

00:20:38.956 --> 00:20:42.196
So as Jamie mentioned,
the way you're doing this,

00:20:42.196 --> 00:20:44.106
you have a virtual
interface that is going

00:20:44.106 --> 00:20:47.706
to be sending packets up
into your protocol provider

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:50.056
and then you're going to
send that off to your server.

00:20:50.056 --> 00:20:51.456
When you receive packets back

00:20:51.456 --> 00:20:53.446
from the server you re-inject
them back into the stack.

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:57.236
I want to start first
with the outbound flow.

00:20:57.846 --> 00:21:03.206
A packet tunnel provider has a
property called a packet flow.

00:21:03.486 --> 00:21:05.446
This represents the
virtual interface

00:21:05.446 --> 00:21:06.556
that you can read
and write into.

00:21:07.946 --> 00:21:09.976
If I call read packets
with completion handler,

00:21:09.976 --> 00:21:13.186
I will get called back
with an array of packets

00:21:13.926 --> 00:21:16.996
that have been sent
out into the network.

00:21:17.626 --> 00:21:23.286
I can send these into my
protocol to encapsulate

00:21:23.356 --> 00:21:26.636
and to encrypt them and
generate a new array

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:28.276
of encrypted payloads.

00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:33.166
And very easily I can write
these as multiple data grams

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:36.726
at one time into the UDP session
to send over to the server.

00:21:37.646 --> 00:21:40.166
That's all we need to
do to send packets out.

00:21:41.236 --> 00:21:42.786
Coming back in is very similar.

00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:47.196
Here I have a function
that is taking packets

00:21:47.946 --> 00:21:52.266
in from the UDP server.

00:21:53.086 --> 00:21:56.456
And I can simply send
these to my protocol.

00:21:56.456 --> 00:22:01.336
I can decapsulate them, generate
IP packets which I then write

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:02.786
into my packet flow property.

00:22:06.896 --> 00:22:10.266
Great. So now I have
a connection

00:22:10.266 --> 00:22:13.826
that can be established
in read and write.

00:22:14.036 --> 00:22:15.816
Let's see how this
looks in practice.

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:19.416
All right.

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:21.456
So here I have my device.

00:22:21.456 --> 00:22:24.106
If you notice I've
installed already my VPN app.

00:22:26.626 --> 00:22:28.676
First I want to show you that
if I go into Safari and try

00:22:28.676 --> 00:22:29.986
to access the internal website,

00:22:30.076 --> 00:22:32.406
I do not have access
to it right now.

00:22:32.406 --> 00:22:39.486
I now can go into my VPN
app and I hit start VPN.

00:22:39.486 --> 00:22:42.186
And what this did,

00:22:42.186 --> 00:22:45.756
in the background it kicked
off the tunnel packet provider.

00:22:46.726 --> 00:22:49.586
If you can see now, I
do have the VPN badge

00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:50.516
up in the status bar.

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:52.716
It actually did come up and
establish the connection.

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:56.496
I can then go back
into Safari and I see

00:22:56.716 --> 00:22:58.426
that my internal
page has now loaded.

00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:03.856
So we have a fully working VPN
protocol provider all written

00:23:03.856 --> 00:23:04.316
in Swift.

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:05.286
That simple.

00:23:06.516 --> 00:23:11.056
[Applause]

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:14.316
>> TOM PAULY: Back to Jamie.

00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:14.886
>> JAMIE WOOD: All right.

00:23:14.886 --> 00:23:15.586
Thank you, Tommy.

00:23:16.156 --> 00:23:17.956
So Tommy just showed us how

00:23:17.956 --> 00:23:19.436
to create a can packet
tunnel provider.

00:23:19.436 --> 00:23:22.156
It's easy and powerful.

00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:27.076
So while we are on the subject
of Packet Tunnel Provider I want

00:23:27.076 --> 00:23:31.716
to take a moment and talk about
Per-App VPN for managed apps.

00:23:31.716 --> 00:23:37.216
Per-App VPN is great for BYOD or
bring your own device use cases.

00:23:37.806 --> 00:23:40.976
In BYOD you have company
employees who want

00:23:40.976 --> 00:23:42.346
to bring their own
personal device,

00:23:42.866 --> 00:23:44.646
connect it to the
company's internal network

00:23:44.646 --> 00:23:46.076
and access network resources.

00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:49.076
They also don't want all
of their Internet traffic

00:23:49.076 --> 00:23:50.836
to be routed through
the company's VPN.

00:23:50.836 --> 00:23:54.576
And then you have
enterprises that want

00:23:54.576 --> 00:23:56.696
to give their employees
access, but they want

00:23:56.696 --> 00:23:58.196
to restrict the applications

00:23:58.496 --> 00:24:00.276
that can access their
internal network.

00:24:01.276 --> 00:24:04.636
So this is where
Per-App VPN is great.

00:24:05.506 --> 00:24:07.706
So with Per-App VPN
you can set up the VPN

00:24:07.706 --> 00:24:10.956
so that only certain managed
applications can use the VPN.

00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:15.916
The way to set this up
is using Apple's own MDM

00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:20.166
or mobile device
management protocol.

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:22.706
You enroll devices
with an MDM service.

00:24:23.246 --> 00:24:26.306
The MDM service has
the ability to push

00:24:26.306 --> 00:24:29.896
down configurations including
VPN configurations as well

00:24:29.896 --> 00:24:31.306
as managed applications.

00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:36.466
And the MDM service can also
link those managed applications

00:24:36.606 --> 00:24:39.576
with Per-App VPN
configurations to send

00:24:39.576 --> 00:24:43.226
up a Per-App VPN deployment.

00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:48.856
Now, we support Per-App VPN
with, we've always supported it

00:24:48.856 --> 00:24:51.036
with custom App Proxy providers.

00:24:51.646 --> 00:24:57.136
In iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan,
we now support Per-App VPN

00:24:57.276 --> 00:24:58.816
with custom packet
tunnel providers

00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:00.926
and support Per-App VPN

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:03.796
with a built-in IPSEC
clients on the platform.

00:25:05.266 --> 00:25:09.036
So let's go ahead and take a
look at how Per-App VPN works

00:25:09.296 --> 00:25:11.106
in the network data path.

00:25:11.106 --> 00:25:13.996
We have the same Packet Tunnel
Provider that we had before.

00:25:14.076 --> 00:25:17.136
We have the UTUN0
interface again

00:25:17.136 --> 00:25:19.586
that the traffic is routed to.

00:25:19.586 --> 00:25:21.956
Now we have a managed
application that is linked

00:25:21.956 --> 00:25:23.416
to the VPN configuration.

00:25:24.236 --> 00:25:27.856
Instead of having the traffic
routed to the UTUN0 interface

00:25:27.856 --> 00:25:31.376
by the destination IP,
the traffic is routed

00:25:31.376 --> 00:25:34.586
to the UTUN0 interface by
the source application.

00:25:35.056 --> 00:25:37.876
Only this managed app
can access the VPN.

00:25:38.596 --> 00:25:41.636
If the user uses another
app that is not managed,

00:25:42.306 --> 00:25:44.516
it is going to connect
to the network

00:25:44.516 --> 00:25:45.856
out the physical interface.

00:25:46.006 --> 00:25:47.906
Even if it's trying to
connect to the same IP

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:49.586
that the managed app
is connecting to.

00:25:49.586 --> 00:25:50.246
All right.

00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:53.336
So that's how Per-App VPN works.

00:25:54.356 --> 00:25:56.676
Tommy is going to give us
another brief demo of how

00:25:56.676 --> 00:25:58.846
to configure Per-App VPN.

00:25:58.956 --> 00:25:59.206
>> TOM PAULY: Great.

00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:00.626
Thank you, Jamie.

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.886
We are really excited to have...

00:26:03.196 --> 00:26:06.716
Now, everyone who is
writing a custom protocol

00:26:06.876 --> 00:26:09.696
or even using the built in
IPSEC protocols will be able

00:26:09.696 --> 00:26:13.286
to deploy Per-App VPN to
make great UID solutions.

00:26:13.816 --> 00:26:20.726
As Jamie mentioned, we create
these Per-App configurations

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:21.956
with MDM.

00:26:22.346 --> 00:26:24.966
MDM is pushing down a
configuration profile

00:26:25.296 --> 00:26:29.856
that defines the VPN and also
pushes down the managed apps

00:26:29.856 --> 00:26:32.336
to associate with that VPN.

00:26:32.336 --> 00:26:36.946
I want to show how to modify
an existing VPN profile

00:26:37.256 --> 00:26:38.586
to make it work with
Per-App VPN.

00:26:39.206 --> 00:26:40.876
I'm going to do it
with a profile

00:26:40.876 --> 00:26:44.026
that configures the same
custom app that I just built.

00:26:47.556 --> 00:26:50.486
So here is a look
into a VPN profile.

00:26:50.486 --> 00:26:51.336
There's a lot on here.

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:52.706
You don't have to
get it all right now.

00:26:52.706 --> 00:26:55.536
I want to highlight the
parts that are different.

00:26:55.536 --> 00:26:57.876
The three tweaks
that you need to make

00:26:57.876 --> 00:27:01.666
to have this profile
work with Per-App VPN.

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:03.086
The first is the payload type.

00:27:03.626 --> 00:27:08.426
Normally it is
com.Apple.vpn.managed simply add

00:27:08.756 --> 00:27:15.036
a .applayer to the end of that
to make that a Per-App VPN.

00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:17.476
There are multiple
types of providers

00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:20.216
that work with Per-App VPN.

00:27:20.586 --> 00:27:22.656
So we need to specify
which type you're using.

00:27:23.176 --> 00:27:27.136
Within the VPN payload,
we have a new key

00:27:27.136 --> 00:27:28.216
that is the provider type.

00:27:28.976 --> 00:27:31.776
And you can specify either
packet tunnel or App Proxy.

00:27:32.146 --> 00:27:36.216
In this case as you saw, my app
uses a packet tunnel protocol.

00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:37.996
I'll specify that one.

00:27:38.536 --> 00:27:45.106
The last field you need to
add is called the VPN UUID.

00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:48.646
Which is an arbitrary
string that acts as the glue

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:53.386
between a VPN configuration
and the managed apps.

00:27:53.586 --> 00:27:58.076
When an MDM server pushes down
managed apps, it will mark them

00:27:58.156 --> 00:27:59.886
with the same VPN UUID

00:28:00.136 --> 00:28:04.616
so the system knows those
apps can only route traffic

00:28:04.796 --> 00:28:06.916
through that VPN.

00:28:07.476 --> 00:28:13.106
This profile should
work for Per-App VPN.

00:28:13.356 --> 00:28:17.426
So because we are so eager
to have you guys make apps

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:18.376
that work with Per-App VPN,

00:28:19.246 --> 00:28:22.296
we wanted to make it really
easy to develop with it.

00:28:22.436 --> 00:28:23.576
You may not have access

00:28:23.616 --> 00:28:25.886
to a full MDM solution
while you are developing.

00:28:26.616 --> 00:28:31.686
So we've enabled for development
builds of your app only.

00:28:31.736 --> 00:28:32.946
Not distribution builds.

00:28:33.896 --> 00:28:37.596
The ability to specify
in an info Plist apps

00:28:37.596 --> 00:28:39.526
to associate your
VPN configurations

00:28:39.526 --> 00:28:43.256
with to make it easier
to test Per-App VPN.

00:28:43.436 --> 00:28:48.246
Here is a look at an info Plist
of your app, it's small here,

00:28:48.246 --> 00:28:53.356
but we have a new key
called NETest App Mapping.

00:28:53.846 --> 00:28:55.416
This is a dictionary of arrays,

00:28:55.486 --> 00:28:58.546
the keys are the same
UUID I mentioned before,

00:28:58.546 --> 00:29:03.136
the glue to hold configurations
and apps together.

00:29:03.136 --> 00:29:08.196
Within the array you can specify
the string bundle identifiers

00:29:08.286 --> 00:29:11.066
of apps that you want to
force to go through your VPN.

00:29:11.066 --> 00:29:14.366
In this case I'm going
to use the box app.

00:29:15.356 --> 00:29:17.146
Great to show you
what this looks like.

00:29:17.146 --> 00:29:21.176
I installed the profile and
the info Plist on my device.

00:29:21.746 --> 00:29:25.086
And so here I have
a configuration

00:29:25.606 --> 00:29:26.506
for my Per-App VPN.

00:29:26.506 --> 00:29:31.476
And you can see that I have my
custom Packet Tunnel protocol.

00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:36.966
And listed are the included apps
and it has now associated Box

00:29:36.966 --> 00:29:38.276
with my VPN configuration.

00:29:39.066 --> 00:29:41.396
That's all it takes to
making Per-App VPN work

00:29:41.396 --> 00:29:43.626
with your protocol.

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:44.366
Thank you.

00:29:45.516 --> 00:29:49.136
[Applause]

00:29:49.636 --> 00:29:49.946
>> JAMIE WOOD: All right.

00:29:49.946 --> 00:29:50.606
Thank you, Tommy.

00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:54.406
So we really think that Per-App
VPN is a great deployment

00:29:54.566 --> 00:29:57.126
for BYOD, provides a
great user experience

00:29:57.196 --> 00:29:58.686
for company employees.

00:29:58.686 --> 00:30:01.366
We highly encourage
you to deploy it.

00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:08.146
So next I want to talk about
the NEApp Proxy Provider API.

00:30:09.216 --> 00:30:12.976
Now, any App Proxy
providers work exclusively

00:30:13.226 --> 00:30:14.206
with Per-App VPN.

00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:17.846
So let's take a look
and see how these work,

00:30:17.846 --> 00:30:19.836
how they are different from
the packet tunnel providers.

00:30:20.076 --> 00:30:23.666
We have a managed application,
an App Proxy Provider running

00:30:23.666 --> 00:30:26.666
on the system and the managed
app is going to connect

00:30:26.706 --> 00:30:28.706
to an internal network resource.

00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:32.716
Instead of having IP packets
routed to the UTUN0 interface,

00:30:33.616 --> 00:30:36.136
the data the managed app writes

00:30:36.136 --> 00:30:39.836
to its socket is diverted
directly to the proxy provider.

00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:44.286
So from there the NEApp Proxy
Provider can send the data

00:30:44.286 --> 00:30:47.196
to the proxy server
and the return data

00:30:47.196 --> 00:30:50.226
from the proxy server will be
sent back to the proxy provider,

00:30:50.406 --> 00:30:51.936
it can inject it into the socket

00:30:51.936 --> 00:30:53.776
to be delivered to
the application.

00:30:55.056 --> 00:31:00.066
The reason why we added the
NEApp Proxy Provider API is

00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:01.626
really about the servers.

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:04.046
So you're connecting to
these transparent network

00:31:04.046 --> 00:31:04.906
proxy servers.

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:07.826
The servers are usually
easier to deploy

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.126
than a fully fledged
IP layer VPN.

00:31:10.126 --> 00:31:14.396
You don't have to provision
virtual IPs to assign

00:31:14.396 --> 00:31:15.796
to the UTUN0 interface.

00:31:16.366 --> 00:31:19.496
They usually scale
a little better.

00:31:19.496 --> 00:31:21.616
We've given you the
NEApp Proxy Provider API

00:31:21.776 --> 00:31:23.756
to connect to these servers.

00:31:24.246 --> 00:31:30.446
And a new thing that we added
for App Proxy Provider in iOS 9

00:31:30.736 --> 00:31:36.076
and OS X El Capitan is the
ability to proxy UDP traffic

00:31:36.076 --> 00:31:37.286
in addition to TCP traffic.

00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:41.816
Oh, here we have a managed app

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:45.026
to illustrate those
are still connecting

00:31:45.736 --> 00:31:48.336
out the physical interface.

00:31:48.336 --> 00:31:51.706
Okay. So that's the NETunnel
provider family of APIs.

00:31:52.096 --> 00:31:54.956
Use these APIs to
create custom clients

00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.136
for your tunneling protocol,

00:31:56.236 --> 00:31:58.696
to connect to enterprise
VPN servers.

00:31:58.696 --> 00:32:01.696
Now let's take a look

00:32:01.696 --> 00:32:04.136
at the NEFilter provider
family of APIs.

00:32:04.296 --> 00:32:06.656
Use these APIs to create the
network content filtering

00:32:06.656 --> 00:32:07.786
solutions for schools.

00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:11.516
There are currently some ways

00:32:11.516 --> 00:32:13.796
that schools can do
network content filtering

00:32:14.226 --> 00:32:15.306
with iOS devices.

00:32:16.856 --> 00:32:21.196
They can deploy an on-site
content filter, put a device

00:32:21.196 --> 00:32:25.436
on their local network and
route all their Internet traffic

00:32:25.436 --> 00:32:26.666
through that content filter

00:32:26.666 --> 00:32:28.776
so that they can filter
the content, right?

00:32:29.326 --> 00:32:31.706
The draw back with this is
that it's only available

00:32:31.706 --> 00:32:32.876
on the school's local network.

00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:35.866
If the students want to
take the schools iPads

00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:40.816
or iPhones home they either
can't browse the Internet at all

00:32:40.816 --> 00:32:43.876
when they are home or browse
the Internet unfiltered.

00:32:44.306 --> 00:32:45.706
This is not so great.

00:32:45.866 --> 00:32:49.226
To sort of try to solve
some of that problem,

00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:52.046
the school can deploy global
proxy, put it on the Internet,

00:32:52.586 --> 00:32:54.856
route all of the Internet
traffic through the proxy

00:32:54.856 --> 00:32:56.246
to perform the content
filtering.

00:32:56.876 --> 00:33:00.986
The draw back, the school has to
deploy and maintain the proxy,

00:33:00.986 --> 00:33:06.086
and not all the schools have
the resources to do that.

00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:08.766
Another solution is to
use a full tunnel VPN.

00:33:08.766 --> 00:33:11.136
That has a lot of the same
problems as global proxy

00:33:11.136 --> 00:33:13.236
and may be even harder
to deploy and maintain.

00:33:14.356 --> 00:33:16.416
The best solution for schools is

00:33:16.416 --> 00:33:18.596
to filter the network
content on the device.

00:33:18.816 --> 00:33:19.876
Before it leaves the device

00:33:20.376 --> 00:33:23.156
and just before it's actually
delivered to the user.

00:33:24.006 --> 00:33:27.656
So this is exactly what the
NEFilter provider family

00:33:27.656 --> 00:33:28.856
of APIs allows you to do.

00:33:29.456 --> 00:33:34.786
Now, the NEFilter provider
APIs are only available on iOS.

00:33:36.046 --> 00:33:39.366
And using API you can
perform dynamic evaluation

00:33:39.566 --> 00:33:40.896
of network content.

00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:46.906
You have the ability to update
filtering rules on the fly,

00:33:48.036 --> 00:33:49.606
for instance downloaded
from the Internet.

00:33:50.206 --> 00:33:55.096
And you have the ability to send
back a customizable block page

00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:56.606
to the user when they
try to access something

00:33:56.726 --> 00:34:02.396
that they are not
allowed to access.

00:34:03.066 --> 00:34:06.916
Now, NEFilter provider only
works on supervised devices.

00:34:06.916 --> 00:34:08.376
We are targeting
this at schools,

00:34:08.686 --> 00:34:11.996
schools that own their devices,
are locking them down so

00:34:12.036 --> 00:34:15.016
that users can't install
new apps or change settings.

00:34:15.746 --> 00:34:18.255
This is where filter
provider works.

00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:20.826
So let's take a look

00:34:20.826 --> 00:34:24.436
at how filter provider
works in the data path.

00:34:24.626 --> 00:34:28.085
So we have an NEFilter data
provider extension running

00:34:28.196 --> 00:34:28.846
on the system.

00:34:29.356 --> 00:34:32.306
And its job is to make
pass and block decisions

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:35.946
about network content that is
flowing through the system.

00:34:36.065 --> 00:34:38.466
Now, because it has access
to all this network content,

00:34:38.896 --> 00:34:40.936
we've locked down this
data provider so it runs

00:34:40.936 --> 00:34:41.985
in a read only sand box.

00:34:42.606 --> 00:34:43.806
It can't access the network

00:34:44.335 --> 00:34:46.416
and it has read only
access to the disk.

00:34:48.735 --> 00:34:51.735
So we've also provided
another extension,

00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:54.946
the NEFilter control
provider, and its job is

00:34:54.946 --> 00:34:57.346
to feed information to
the filter data provider

00:34:57.346 --> 00:34:58.396
so that it can do its job.

00:34:58.726 --> 00:35:00.656
For instance, download
rules over the Internet,

00:35:01.146 --> 00:35:02.636
write them to a location on disk

00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:06.976
where the data provider
can access them.

00:35:07.836 --> 00:35:11.476
Now, suppose that the user is
running an app using Web kit,

00:35:12.106 --> 00:35:12.446
right?

00:35:12.446 --> 00:35:18.026
They have a UI Web view in
their UI and so all the content

00:35:18.026 --> 00:35:20.456
that is being rendered into
the Web kit is passed off

00:35:20.456 --> 00:35:23.596
to the filter data
provider, which makes a pass

00:35:23.596 --> 00:35:27.276
or block decision on that data.

00:35:27.436 --> 00:35:30.596
So obviously not all
applications use Web kit.

00:35:31.386 --> 00:35:34.306
There's some applications that
are using other networking APIs

00:35:34.306 --> 00:35:36.676
such as NSURL session,
NSURL connection,

00:35:37.076 --> 00:35:38.356
some of the CFNetwork APIs.

00:35:39.076 --> 00:35:43.976
For those APIs we added a hook
into the socket layer to send

00:35:43.976 --> 00:35:45.936
that traffic over to
the filter data provider

00:35:45.936 --> 00:35:48.266
so it can make a
pass/block decision.

00:35:49.116 --> 00:35:52.986
As you can see the
filter control provider

00:35:52.986 --> 00:35:56.966
and data provider together
provide a comprehensive content

00:35:56.966 --> 00:36:00.456
filtering solution
on the device.

00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:02.076
So for Web kit applications,

00:36:02.756 --> 00:36:04.946
when the data provider
makes a block decision,

00:36:05.086 --> 00:36:07.976
decides to block some
access to the content,

00:36:08.696 --> 00:36:12.216
the data provider can send
a, instruct the Web kit

00:36:12.506 --> 00:36:14.016
to display a block page.

00:36:14.386 --> 00:36:15.956
Here is an example
of that block page.

00:36:16.206 --> 00:36:20.426
You can, using the API you
can customize this block page

00:36:20.426 --> 00:36:21.496
in a number of ways.

00:36:21.606 --> 00:36:23.486
You can change the
organization that's displayed.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:25.836
For example, you can display
the name of the school

00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:29.506
and you can customize
this request access link.

00:36:30.076 --> 00:36:32.216
You can choose to not
display the link at all,

00:36:32.296 --> 00:36:35.146
not give the user the option of
gaining access to the content.

00:36:35.146 --> 00:36:39.076
If you display it, you can
display the text of the link

00:36:39.626 --> 00:36:40.926
and target of the link.

00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:45.126
Point to the Web service where
users can go and request access

00:36:45.176 --> 00:36:46.406
to the blocked content.

00:36:46.906 --> 00:36:51.716
So that's the NEFilter
provider family of APIs.

00:36:51.716 --> 00:36:55.226
You can use these APIs to
create powerful comprehensive,

00:36:55.706 --> 00:36:59.086
on-device network content
filtering solutions for schools.

00:36:59.586 --> 00:37:05.466
Here is all the Network
Extension APIs we've talked

00:37:05.466 --> 00:37:06.706
about today.

00:37:07.866 --> 00:37:10.266
And here's some of
the great apps

00:37:10.816 --> 00:37:12.956
that you can create
using these APIs.

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:17.206
You can create apps for Wi-Fi
Hotspot, personal VPN services,

00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:19.046
enterprise remote access VPNs

00:37:19.046 --> 00:37:22.226
and you can create on-device
network content filtering

00:37:22.226 --> 00:37:23.426
solutions for schools.

00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:27.286
As you can see these
are powerful APIs.

00:37:27.876 --> 00:37:29.116
They allow you to extend

00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:31.686
and customize the core
networking features

00:37:31.686 --> 00:37:32.816
of Apple's platforms.

00:37:33.676 --> 00:37:36.786
And because these are very
powerful APIs we do require some

00:37:36.786 --> 00:37:39.216
special entitlements for
you to be able to use these.

00:37:40.436 --> 00:37:41.986
To use the NEVPN manager API,

00:37:42.096 --> 00:37:45.466
you need to select the
personal VPN capability

00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:47.956
in your project settings' Xcode.

00:37:47.956 --> 00:37:54.226
To use the any Hotspot helper
API, the NETunnel family

00:37:54.226 --> 00:37:56.736
of APIs, and the
NEFilter provider family

00:37:56.736 --> 00:38:00.096
of APIs you need access to
other special entitlements.

00:38:00.886 --> 00:38:02.916
The way to get these
is to send a request

00:38:03.486 --> 00:38:05.096
to networkextension@Apple.com.

00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:08.356
We'll send you back a
questionnaire that we'll ask you

00:38:08.356 --> 00:38:12.406
to fill out and send back to us
and we'll process your request.

00:38:12.706 --> 00:38:15.896
We're excited to be
delivering these APIs to you.

00:38:15.896 --> 00:38:17.946
We are looking forward to
getting all of your requests

00:38:18.566 --> 00:38:22.856
and giving you access
to these APIs.

00:38:23.536 --> 00:38:25.206
So what should you do?

00:38:26.026 --> 00:38:27.796
Port your Captive Network apps

00:38:27.896 --> 00:38:31.336
to use the NEHotspot
helper, which is seamless.

00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:38.256
Adopt the NEManager API
in your personal VPN app

00:38:38.906 --> 00:38:41.696
to create seamless
user experience

00:38:42.056 --> 00:38:43.986
for those using your
personal VPN service.

00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:47.276
Use the NETunnel provider

00:38:47.756 --> 00:38:52.136
to create powerful
custom enterprise VPN apps

00:38:53.186 --> 00:38:54.426
that connect to your VPN server.

00:38:54.986 --> 00:38:58.696
Use the MDM to deploy
Per-App VPN

00:38:58.696 --> 00:39:01.546
for great BYOD user experiences.

00:39:01.546 --> 00:39:06.376
And use the NEFilter
provider APIs

00:39:06.626 --> 00:39:09.376
to create dynamic on-device
network content filtering

00:39:09.796 --> 00:39:10.476
for schools.

00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:14.926
Here is where you can
get more information.

00:39:15.126 --> 00:39:17.476
Unfortunately, the documentation
is not yet published.

00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:18.436
Coming soon.

00:39:18.436 --> 00:39:21.496
Please keep searching for
it on the developer website.

00:39:21.606 --> 00:39:24.506
And the sample code is
also not quite ready yet.

00:39:25.026 --> 00:39:26.946
Keep searching for the
simple tunnel sample.

00:39:27.346 --> 00:39:29.316
We have a great sample going.

00:39:29.316 --> 00:39:30.856
We haven't quite
finished it yet.

00:39:31.426 --> 00:39:33.866
Please keep looking for it.

00:39:35.156 --> 00:39:38.556
For more information you
are welcome to participate

00:39:38.696 --> 00:39:41.796
in the dev forums, contact
developer technical support.

can send your network extension

00:39:50.316 --> 00:39:51.616
request to.

00:39:53.966 --> 00:39:55.346
Here are related sessions.

00:39:55.346 --> 00:39:56.686
We encourage you
to check these out.

00:39:57.106 --> 00:39:58.346
