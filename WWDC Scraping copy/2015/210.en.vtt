00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:26.636
>> ANUSH NADATHUR: Thank you.

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:31.136
Hello, everybody.

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:31.746
Good afternoon.

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.346
Welcome. Thanks for coming.

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:37.156
My name is Anush Nadathur

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:39.656
and I'm a software
engineer on HomeKit.

00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:43.746
Today, my colleague Naveen
and I are going to talk

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:45.916
about what's new in
HomeKit for iOS 9.

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:50.916
Now for the past few years
we have seen a proliferation

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:53.216
of home devices in the market.

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:57.486
What this gives you is
a tremendous opportunity

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.676
to influence the experience
people have when interacting

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:05.036
with these devices in the
comfort of their own home.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:11.496
Apple introduced HomeKit in iOS
8 so that we can work together

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:15.376
to bring home automation
to a much wider audience

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:20.246
than in the past, and to deliver
a consistent user experience

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.086
for our customers.

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:26.856
We had a great session last
year, but for those of you

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:30.126
who may have not seen
it, here's a brief recap.

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:36.796
HomeKit provides
a common protocol

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.986
that all HomeKit-enabled
accesses implement

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:41.996
and interact with iOS.

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:46.606
On this protocol, we
have defined profiles

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:50.076
that describe many of the
commonly used accessories.

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:54.286
However, we also
made it flexible

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:58.916
so that you can define profiles
that define custom features

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.176
of your accessory and
still be HomeKit-enabled.

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:07.616
One of the key features
in HomeKit is

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:10.656
to provide a common
view of the home

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:12.536
across all HomeKit applications.

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:16.866
So what that means is if you
use app A and switch to app B,

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:18.456
both get the same home data.

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:21.396
This is critical
for our customers

00:02:21.396 --> 00:02:23.666
because that delivers the
consistent user experience

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.806
that we want them to have.

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:30.716
If your accessory implements one
of the Apple-defined profiles,

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.276
Siri works right out of the box.

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:40.476
Yeah. And the HomeKit framework

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:43.356
on iOS models a home
very naturally.

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:48.856
So we have objects which
describe rooms, zones,

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:51.206
which are a collection
of rooms, and of course,

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:52.576
accesses that you can control.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:57.766
Now, none of this would
matter to our customers

00:02:58.016 --> 00:03:00.766
if their data is not
private or secure.

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:05.806
HomeKit was designed
with privacy and security

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:06.696
from the very beginning.

00:03:07.656 --> 00:03:10.066
All communication between iOS

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:13.206
and the HomeKit accessories
is end-to-end encrypted,

00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:17.376
and we never use keys
across different sessions.

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:21.816
So when you have a key, that key
cannot be used to dig up data

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:23.686
in the past or in the future.

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:28.956
And all home data is encrypted
on the device using keys

00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:30.196
that are local to that device.

00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:33.136
So your data is completely
private and secure.

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:36.816
So that's HomeKit in iOS 8.

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:39.496
So let's talk about what we
have in store for you today.

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:44.886
I'm going to go over features
and enhancements for HomeKit

00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:48.956
in iOS 9, and Naveen
will go over updates

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:51.246
in our accessories space.

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:55.586
So let's get right to it.

00:03:58.496 --> 00:04:01.856
We've got some great
features for HomeKit in iOS 9,

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:06.516
but we have also added
enhancements based on feedback

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:08.846
that we have received from
developers in the past year.

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:11.156
So please keep those
feedback coming.

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:13.586
We absolutely love them.

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:16.896
So let's begin with a
small change that we made

00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:20.486
but has a tremendous impact
on your daily development.

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:25.216
Let's take an example
of a light in a bedroom

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:28.626
and we move it to
the living room.

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:33.036
In iOS 8, if your app
comes to the foreground,

00:04:33.686 --> 00:04:35.386
we would have notified your app

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:39.366
of this change using home
manager did update homes

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:40.446
delegate callback.

00:04:41.316 --> 00:04:43.866
Now, this tells you
something has changed

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:46.896
but also gives you a new set of
objects that now you have to use

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:49.916
and figure out what exactly
has changed in your home.

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:56.986
We thought we should do better,
so in iOS 9, HomeKit is going

00:04:56.986 --> 00:04:59.886
to maintain your objects
and only update properties

00:04:59.886 --> 00:05:01.046
that have actually changed.

00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:03.196
[Applause] Thank you.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:09.566
So what that means is, in
our example, you're going

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:10.746
to get a single delegate
callback:

00:05:10.946 --> 00:05:12.666
home did update room
[unintelligible].

00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:15.856
I think this is going to
simplify your code base

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.356
and let you focus on your
features for your app.

00:05:19.316 --> 00:05:22.436
That's not the only
enhancement that we have added.

00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:25.346
Let's talk about another
one using an example.

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:29.836
Let's say I have a living
room, and I have a photo

00:05:29.836 --> 00:05:32.676
of the living room that I
want to show in the app.

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:35.946
So what that means is you
need to be able to associate

00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:39.876
and find a HomeKit
object representing a room

00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:43.036
across relaunches of your app.

00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:47.536
Now, a room in HomeKit
is represented using a

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:48.486
HMRoom class.

00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:53.386
This has a name property,
and names are not immutable.

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.806
So any HomeKit app
can change this.

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:59.776
To solve our problem, we need
something more persistent.

00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:04.566
So in iOS 9, we are introducing
persistent identifiers

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:07.716
across all relevant
HomeKit classes.

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:11.436
[Applause]

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:12.336
Thank you.

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:15.976
So you are going to have a
unique identifier property

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:18.116
on these classes.

00:06:18.986 --> 00:06:22.936
These are unique applications,
and now you can use this

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:28.016
to associate context data
in your app and apply that

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:29.956
and associate that with
the HomeKit object.

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:36.506
Next I want to talk about
user management in iOS 8.

00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:43.356
Your app had the following three
APIs to let users manage people

00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:46.426
in their homes so they can
add users, remove users,

00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:48.406
and list users in their homes.

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:53.946
In iOS 9, we are deprecating
these and replacing it

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:57.976
with a much simpler API, manage
users with completion handler.

00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:03.266
So this API presents a full
view controller that is going

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:06.176
to let users manage
people in their homes.

00:07:08.216 --> 00:07:11.976
Developers need to move
to this new API in iOS 9

00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:15.826
so that our customers can
get a much richer experience

00:07:16.376 --> 00:07:17.466
with respect to home sharing.

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:22.986
I want to stay on a related
topic, user capabilities.

00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:27.066
When you share your
home with a user,

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:30.546
they can control the
accessories in the home,

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:33.286
but they cannot make any
configuration changes.

00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:40.066
For a good user experience, your
app needs to show capabilities

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:41.816
that are only relevant
to that user.

00:07:43.006 --> 00:07:44.616
To achieve this, you now need

00:07:44.616 --> 00:07:46.716
to know the privilege
level of that user.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.316
So, for example, if they
are not an administrator,

00:07:50.226 --> 00:07:53.086
you should not let them
edit the name of a room.

00:07:53.086 --> 00:07:56.806
So we are going to give you
APIs to let you figure this out.

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:02.156
So on HMHome, we are adding
a new property, current user.

00:08:02.886 --> 00:08:07.276
That represents the currently
signed-in user on that device.

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:12.706
You can use this and pass along
to a new method on HMHome,

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:15.236
home access control for user.

00:08:15.956 --> 00:08:19.486
That returns a HMHome
access control object,

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:23.456
which encapsulates the
privileges of that user.

00:08:24.456 --> 00:08:25.786
Let's see what this
class looks like.

00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:29.706
It has an administrative
property that will be set

00:08:30.306 --> 00:08:31.596
if you are the administrator
of the home.

00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:34.936
So now you can update your
apps and use this property

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:37.856
and share only relevant
features for that user.

00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:46.706
Moving on, let's talk about a
great feature in iOS 8, scenes.

00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:52.876
Now scenes allow our customers
to control multiple accesses

00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:53.776
with a single command.

00:08:54.256 --> 00:08:58.636
So I can have a good night
scene where it switches out all

00:08:58.636 --> 00:09:01.936
of the lights, secures my
home, and sets the temperature

00:09:01.936 --> 00:09:05.016
down to a comfortable level
with a single command.

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:07.266
This is a very powerful feature.

00:09:07.886 --> 00:09:11.576
In iOS 9 we want our customers
to use this even more.

00:09:11.936 --> 00:09:15.476
To help this, we are
introducing predefined scenes.

00:09:16.816 --> 00:09:18.566
There are four common events

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:20.696
that most people
experience every day.

00:09:20.696 --> 00:09:26.316
They are getting up, you
leave home, you return home,

00:09:27.076 --> 00:09:29.426
and then you go to bed.

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:32.786
Now that you know what these
four predefined scenes mean,

00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:34.156
you can apply context to them.

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:37.976
So in your app, you can
actually make suggestions

00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:42.706
to let customers configure
these four predefined scenes

00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:44.316
with meaningful actions.

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:47.956
And to have a good
experience for our customers,

00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:51.956
predefined scenes cannot
be deleted from a home.

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:55.446
Let's walk through the APIs.

00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:59.576
A scene in HomeKit is
represented using a HM action

00:09:59.576 --> 00:10:00.446
set object.

00:10:01.686 --> 00:10:04.266
We have added a new
property, action set type,

00:10:04.516 --> 00:10:06.606
that describes the kind of scene

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.856
that you are working
with in your app.

00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:12.996
We have four constants
that correspond

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:15.866
to the four predefined scenes
I talked about earlier.

00:10:16.956 --> 00:10:19.676
We also have a fifth type,
the user defined type,

00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:24.816
and this is set on the
scene that your app creates.

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:28.556
How do I access these
predefined scenes in a home?

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:31.996
They are automatically
populated for you as part

00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:35.316
of the action set property
on an HMHome class.

00:10:35.816 --> 00:10:39.076
But we also have
a convenience API,

00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:41.966
built-in action set of type.

00:10:42.466 --> 00:10:44.096
That takes the action set type

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:50.846
and returns a HM action set
object that corresponds to one

00:10:50.846 --> 00:10:51.906
of your predefined scenes.

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:56.286
So that's the APIs, but we want

00:10:56.286 --> 00:10:59.816
to make scenes even much
easier for our customers.

00:11:01.196 --> 00:11:08.246
So now Siri works even
better with scenes in iOS 9.

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:11.406
Siri now recognizes
the names of all scenes

00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:13.786
and simply speaking the name

00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:15.926
of the scene will
actually execute it.

00:11:16.316 --> 00:11:19.096
This is a great way for our
customers to use scenes.

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:26.436
Now let's talk about
the experience

00:11:27.226 --> 00:11:29.526
of adding an accessory
to your home.

00:11:29.786 --> 00:11:34.956
Let's say I have two accessories
from the same manufacturer,

00:11:35.386 --> 00:11:38.016
and they can have the name
of the manufacturer as part

00:11:38.016 --> 00:11:40.336
of the accessory's name
and a model number,

00:11:40.336 --> 00:11:44.146
and when I add this accessory
to the home, I can always look

00:11:44.146 --> 00:11:45.286
up the packaging and figuring

00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:48.146
out I am adding the
right device to my home.

00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:52.756
But a better user experience
for our customers is

00:11:52.756 --> 00:11:54.796
to give some kind of indication

00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:57.086
that provides more
information about the accessory.

00:11:58.256 --> 00:12:01.296
Let's say, for example, we
can give them visual clues,

00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:05.046
present an icon that
tells them the type

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:09.906
of accessory they are adding
is a much better experience.

00:12:10.516 --> 00:12:11.656
To attain this feature,

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:14.916
we are adding accessory
categories in iOS 9.

00:12:16.226 --> 00:12:17.786
This information is available

00:12:17.786 --> 00:12:21.246
to your app during
setup of that accessory.

00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:24.226
So when you browse and you
are finding these accessories,

00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:25.806
it is already available for you.

00:12:27.316 --> 00:12:31.286
And it specifies the primary
category of that accessory.

00:12:33.116 --> 00:12:36.916
Moving on to the APIs for this,
we are introducing a new class,

00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:39.036
HM accessory category.

00:12:39.606 --> 00:12:45.116
This has a property category
type that gives more information

00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:47.086
about that category,
so, in our example,

00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:49.346
you will have category
type light bulb

00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:53.046
and category type fan.

00:12:53.176 --> 00:12:56.766
And the way you access this
category is use the category

00:12:56.766 --> 00:12:58.726
property on an HM accessory.

00:12:59.006 --> 00:13:01.456
So this is available when you
browse for these accessories.

00:13:02.056 --> 00:13:06.086
So we recommend that you use
this new feature and enhance

00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:07.936
that user experience
for our customers during

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:08.906
first-time setup.

00:13:08.906 --> 00:13:20.216
Now let's talk about
HomeKit and the Apple Watch.

00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:23.161
[Applause]

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:28.036
Yeah. As announced
in Monday's keynote,

00:13:28.816 --> 00:13:31.036
HomeKit is now available
on Watch OS.

00:13:31.816 --> 00:13:33.816
Now, this means you can
now go out for a run

00:13:33.816 --> 00:13:37.346
without your iPhone, come back,
and if you have your watch

00:13:37.346 --> 00:13:38.996
with you, you will be able

00:13:38.996 --> 00:13:40.466
to unlock your door
and get back in.

00:13:41.106 --> 00:13:42.716
How cool is that?

00:13:43.516 --> 00:13:47.606
[Applause]

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:52.486
All your home data is
mirrored from your iOS device

00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:55.756
onto the watch, so you can
make changes on your phone

00:13:55.916 --> 00:14:00.416
and they will automatically
synch to the watch.

00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:05.086
You can view homes from the
watch, control your accessories,

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.126
and execute all your scenes.

00:14:08.476 --> 00:14:11.616
We cannot wait to see the
creative experience you are

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:13.296
going to deliver
to our customers

00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:15.196
with HomeKit on the Apple Watch.

00:14:15.596 --> 00:14:23.776
Finally, I want to talk
about a new feature in iOS 9,

00:14:24.426 --> 00:14:26.586
and I am really excited about it

00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:27.986
because I spent a
lot of time on it.

00:14:31.296 --> 00:14:33.146
[Laughter] Let's
talk about triggers.

00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:38.216
Now, in iOS 8, we
have timer triggers,

00:14:38.246 --> 00:14:41.776
so that lets you execute scenes
that specify time of the day.

00:14:41.826 --> 00:14:47.776
I can have an evening scene that
executes at 7 p.m. every day.

00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:52.386
But what if I could do
something like this.

00:14:52.596 --> 00:14:55.186
I return home, I
unlock my front door,

00:14:55.966 --> 00:14:56.956
now that generates an event.

00:14:57.606 --> 00:15:00.536
Let's say it's before 6 p.m.

00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:03.286
and I have a motion
sensor that's right next

00:15:03.286 --> 00:15:03.906
to my front door.

00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:06.476
That gets activated
and detects motion.

00:15:07.196 --> 00:15:09.176
If I have an arrive home scene,

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:11.556
I want that to be
automatically executed.

00:15:11.986 --> 00:15:14.226
And your home is ready
and welcoming you.

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:16.456
I'm happy to say
you can now do this

00:15:16.456 --> 00:15:21.826
in iOS 9 with event triggers.

00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:24.466
One or more events
activate a trigger.

00:15:25.646 --> 00:15:27.426
Let's talk about what
kind of events we support.

00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:31.276
We have events corresponding
to the state of an accessory,

00:15:31.276 --> 00:15:34.626
so this would correspond to
our front door unlocking.

00:15:35.526 --> 00:15:38.126
And we also have
geofence-based events.

00:15:38.486 --> 00:15:40.896
So you can generate
events corresponding

00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:42.646
to when I leave home
or arrive home.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:50.626
Let's go through these and how
we represent them in the APIs.

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:53.476
For the state of an
accessory, we have a new class,

00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:55.426
HM characteristic event,

00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:58.626
and that takes the
characteristic you want

00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:02.466
to be the source of that event
and a trigger value that,

00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:04.556
when that characteristic
meets that value,

00:16:04.966 --> 00:16:07.356
that event will automatically
be fired for you.

00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:14.796
For location-based events, we
have a HM location event class

00:16:14.906 --> 00:16:16.116
that takes a CLRegion.

00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:21.066
You can configure the CLRegion,
and when that criteria is met,

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:24.136
the HM location event class
will automatically fire.

00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:29.556
Let's walk through an example
of our front door being unlocked

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:31.716
and capture that as a
characteristic event.

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:34.366
Here's how you do it.

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:38.236
Create a HM characteristic
event class,

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:42.196
give it the front door
current state characteristic

00:16:42.196 --> 00:16:43.866
as a characteristic that
you want to capture.

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:48.046
And for the trigger value,
just specify door state open.

00:16:48.516 --> 00:16:51.406
Now this event would
be fired when it's part

00:16:51.406 --> 00:16:54.236
of an event trigger as soon
as your front door unlocks.

00:16:54.786 --> 00:16:57.636
I talked about conditions.

00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:03.576
Conditions get execution of
a scene in a given trigger.

00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:07.336
We support three types of
conditions: time-based,

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.306
so I can have something
corresponding

00:17:10.306 --> 00:17:14.526
to before 6 p.m. We also support
the state of an accessory.

00:17:14.726 --> 00:17:17.386
This would be our motion
sensor detecting motion.

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:20.836
Finally, we also have
significant events in a day,

00:17:21.425 --> 00:17:22.536
like sunrise and sunset.

00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:25.626
Let's go through
each one of these

00:17:25.626 --> 00:17:29.536
and see how we create
them in the APIs.

00:17:29.756 --> 00:17:33.086
Conditions are represented
as predicates,

00:17:33.196 --> 00:17:34.946
NS predicates, in the APIs.

00:17:35.696 --> 00:17:39.116
And we have convenience
measures for all of these.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:40.966
You don't have to
worry about them.

00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:43.976
It's very simple to create them.

00:17:44.086 --> 00:17:49.166
On an HMEventTrigger, class, we
have a class method predicate

00:17:49.256 --> 00:17:52.946
for evaluating trigger occurring
before date with components.

00:17:53.366 --> 00:17:55.706
That takes an NS dates component
that you can configure.

00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:57.896
And you can use this,
for example,

00:17:58.886 --> 00:18:01.056
to create the before
6 p.m. condition.

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:04.586
We have one for after
date with components.

00:18:05.206 --> 00:18:07.926
We also have the third
one, which is predicate

00:18:07.926 --> 00:18:11.606
for evaluating trigger occurring
on date with components.

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:13.206
This is really useful.

00:18:13.356 --> 00:18:15.046
You can use this to
create a condition

00:18:15.046 --> 00:18:18.046
for a specific day --
for example, Sundays.

00:18:18.046 --> 00:18:24.076
Let's walk through an example
of creating our condition

00:18:24.076 --> 00:18:28.906
for before 6 p.m. First, we
create an NS dates component

00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:34.386
and set the hour
property to 6 p.m. Next,

00:18:34.836 --> 00:18:37.966
we just use that NS dates
component and pass it along

00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:39.936
to a convenience API predicate

00:18:39.936 --> 00:18:43.626
for evaluating trigger occurring
before date with components,

00:18:43.996 --> 00:18:46.406
and that's going to give you
an NS predicate corresponding

00:18:46.406 --> 00:18:51.946
to before 6 p.m. Next,
the state of an accessory.

00:18:52.726 --> 00:18:58.486
So we also have a convenience
API on the HMEventTrigger class,

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:03.616
namely predicate for evaluating
trigger with characteristic,

00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:07.216
that takes a characteristic
and a matching value that needs

00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:10.926
to be met for that condition
to be evaluated through.

00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:13.156
So for our motion sensor,

00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:16.796
here's how you would create
a condition corresponding it

00:19:17.236 --> 00:19:19.116
to being detecting motion.

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:21.896
Just call the convenience API,

00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:26.396
specify the front door sensor
characteristic as a source

00:19:26.396 --> 00:19:28.486
of the characteristic, and
for the matching value,

00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:29.726
set it to true.

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:31.966
This would mean motion
has been detected.

00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:34.946
It's as simple as that.

00:19:35.106 --> 00:19:37.386
Finally, significant
events in the day.

00:19:37.856 --> 00:19:39.956
We have two convenience
APIs for this:

00:19:41.576 --> 00:19:44.866
predicate for evaluating trigger
occurring before significant

00:19:44.866 --> 00:19:47.726
event, that takes an optional
applying offset parameter,

00:19:47.726 --> 00:19:49.166
which is an NS dates component.

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:52.846
And the second one, as you
guessed it, is predicate

00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:56.126
for evaluating trigger occurring
after significant event.

00:19:57.136 --> 00:19:58.956
We have two constants defined

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:02.596
for significant events:
sunrise and sunset.

00:20:02.596 --> 00:20:07.746
Let's walk through an
example for condition

00:20:07.746 --> 00:20:10.126
for our event trigger
that would correspond

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.896
to 30 minutes before sunset.

00:20:13.906 --> 00:20:14.946
How do we go about doing that?

00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:18.226
You first create an
NS dates component

00:20:18.566 --> 00:20:22.276
and specify the minute
to negative 30.

00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:24.596
And now, just use
our convenience API,

00:20:25.056 --> 00:20:28.876
predicate for evaluating trigger
occurring before significant

00:20:28.876 --> 00:20:32.046
event, give it sunset as
the significant event,

00:20:32.556 --> 00:20:35.106
and give the offset that
we just created above.

00:20:35.736 --> 00:20:39.706
With this, we can now
gate execution of a scene

00:20:40.276 --> 00:20:45.326
if that event fires
after 5:30 p.m. As long

00:20:45.326 --> 00:20:47.686
as it's before 5:30 p.m., it
will always execute that scene.

00:20:49.036 --> 00:20:54.166
So now we have events that
can trigger our event trigger,

00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:56.376
and then we have conditions.

00:20:56.556 --> 00:20:57.496
How do we tie it all together?

00:20:58.996 --> 00:21:01.486
That's when you create
an HMEventTrigger class,

00:21:02.006 --> 00:21:04.226
and the method takes the name.

00:21:05.526 --> 00:21:09.716
You can give one or more
events that activate a trigger.

00:21:09.716 --> 00:21:11.396
Once a trigger is activated,

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.476
we evaluate the corresponding
condition.

00:21:13.716 --> 00:21:16.836
The condition is optional, so if
you don't specify a condition,

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:19.986
it just means we
assume it to be true,

00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:23.556
and we will always execute the
corresponding scene associated

00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:28.536
with that event trigger if any
one of your events activates.

00:21:29.946 --> 00:21:32.476
Now let's walk through
a completer example

00:21:32.476 --> 00:21:34.156
that I talked about earlier.

00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:38.616
We have created a characteristic
event corresponding

00:21:38.616 --> 00:21:40.246
to the front door being locked.

00:21:41.286 --> 00:21:43.796
We created our two conditions,
which is before 6 p.m.

00:21:44.496 --> 00:21:46.836
and the motion sensor
detecting motion.

00:21:47.836 --> 00:21:50.456
How do we tie it all together
and create our event trigger?

00:21:50.456 --> 00:21:54.116
First thing you need to do is
create a compound predicate

00:21:54.196 --> 00:21:56.626
because we want both
our conditions

00:21:57.456 --> 00:21:59.826
to be ended and evaluated.

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:02.786
Both have to be true for
us to execute our scene.

00:22:03.736 --> 00:22:07.016
For that, just use NS compound
predicate and predicate

00:22:07.016 --> 00:22:09.916
with subpredicates, and
specify the two subpredicates

00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:10.886
that we just created earlier.

00:22:12.046 --> 00:22:16.346
Next, create an event trigger
object, give it a name,

00:22:16.346 --> 00:22:20.736
arrived home, and for the events
that can activate this trigger,

00:22:20.776 --> 00:22:22.896
just specify an area
of one element,

00:22:22.976 --> 00:22:26.576
which is a front door
characteristic that corresponds

00:22:26.576 --> 00:22:27.416
with it being unlocked.

00:22:27.766 --> 00:22:30.176
Finally, we just need

00:22:30.656 --> 00:22:34.586
to associate the arrive
home predefined scene

00:22:34.976 --> 00:22:35.776
to this event trigger.

00:22:36.456 --> 00:22:40.386
Use our convenience API on
our home, built-in action set

00:22:40.386 --> 00:22:44.396
of type, give it the
home arrival type

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.876
that now returns your
predefined scene corresponding

00:22:46.876 --> 00:22:50.176
to arrived home, just add
that to the event trigger.

00:22:50.576 --> 00:22:52.376
It's as simple as that.

00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:55.756
Now I'd like to show a demo
of this example I just talked

00:22:55.756 --> 00:23:00.126
about using our HomeKit
Accessory Simulator

00:23:00.196 --> 00:23:03.846
and our HomeKit catalog
sample app,

00:23:04.996 --> 00:23:08.146
which has been completely
rewritten in Swift.

00:23:09.516 --> 00:23:15.116
[Applause]

00:23:15.616 --> 00:23:16.086
There you go.

00:23:16.086 --> 00:23:19.196
So over here we have our
HomeKit Accessory Simulator.

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:22.366
This simulates HomeKit
accessories that are used

00:23:22.366 --> 00:23:25.766
by our developers to develop
their HomeKit applications.

00:23:26.026 --> 00:23:29.616
And over here we have our
HomeKit sample app that,

00:23:30.536 --> 00:23:33.436
you know, that you can use --

00:23:33.436 --> 00:23:35.706
that accesses all
our HomeKit APIs.

00:23:36.096 --> 00:23:38.006
I want to show you a
demo of event triggers.

00:23:38.826 --> 00:23:44.146
Now, you can see that I have
a door lock, a motion sensor,

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:46.846
and a bridge with
two lights behind it

00:23:46.876 --> 00:23:48.346
in the HomeKit Accessory
Simulator.

00:23:48.346 --> 00:23:52.696
And I have added my
accessories to my home.

00:23:56.716 --> 00:24:01.826
So let's go down to the
scenes section of the app,

00:24:01.906 --> 00:24:05.846
and I have configured two of the
predefined scenes in this app.

00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:09.736
I have the "bye, house," that
corresponds to leaving home.

00:24:10.886 --> 00:24:11.976
Let's see what that looks like.

00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:15.616
That sets the light to black

00:24:15.616 --> 00:24:18.466
and switches off all
the power on our lights.

00:24:18.746 --> 00:24:20.766
I am going to go ahead and hit
cancel because I don't want

00:24:20.766 --> 00:24:23.956
to make changes on this, and
let's go down to the "hi,

00:24:23.956 --> 00:24:27.056
house," that corresponds
to arriving home,

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:28.776
and let's see what
that looks like.

00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:35.176
Now, that sets the lights to
on and sets my stereo light

00:24:35.296 --> 00:24:37.376
to green and the
kitchen light to blue.

00:24:37.866 --> 00:24:41.126
Let's try to see
these two scenes

00:24:41.126 --> 00:24:42.716
in action and see what happens.

00:24:43.986 --> 00:24:45.576
So when I execute
the "bye, house,"

00:24:46.236 --> 00:24:48.066
it switches off the two lights.

00:24:48.576 --> 00:24:53.136
And when I execute the "hi,
house," which corresponds

00:24:53.136 --> 00:24:54.586
to arriving home, that switches

00:24:54.586 --> 00:24:56.456
on the two lights
behind the bridge.

00:24:58.236 --> 00:25:00.016
Now, let's simulate leaving home

00:25:00.686 --> 00:25:02.616
and now create our
event trigger.

00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:07.966
I am going to go down to the
trigger section of the app

00:25:09.206 --> 00:25:10.336
and select add trigger.

00:25:10.396 --> 00:25:12.766
You are presented
with three options.

00:25:13.006 --> 00:25:16.276
For our example, it's the
front door being unlocked,

00:25:16.486 --> 00:25:18.116
which is the source
of our trigger.

00:25:18.836 --> 00:25:20.736
That corresponds to a
characteristic, so I am going

00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:22.086
to go ahead and select
characteristic.

00:25:22.086 --> 00:25:25.526
I am going to give
it a name now.

00:25:31.576 --> 00:25:33.436
So this is the name
of my event trigger.

00:25:34.146 --> 00:25:35.206
And now let's go ahead

00:25:35.206 --> 00:25:37.636
and select the characteristic
corresponding

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:39.346
to the front door
being unlocked.

00:25:39.346 --> 00:25:42.266
So let's go down to the
characteristics event

00:25:43.506 --> 00:25:44.636
of the app.

00:25:44.746 --> 00:25:46.576
So add a characteristic.

00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:52.326
And now go down to the front
lock and select unsecured.

00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:54.566
This will correspond to
the door being unlocked.

00:25:54.566 --> 00:26:00.176
I am going to go
back and hit done.

00:26:00.396 --> 00:26:03.486
So now I have captured my
front door being unlocked

00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:04.486
as a source of my trigger.

00:26:05.186 --> 00:26:07.006
Next, let's add our
two conditions.

00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:09.676
For that, let's go down
to the conditions section,

00:26:09.976 --> 00:26:14.016
add condition, and since we
are going to use before 6 p.m.,

00:26:14.016 --> 00:26:14.976
that would mean it's time.

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:22.576
Go to the time section,
and we have two ways

00:26:22.576 --> 00:26:24.546
to add time-based conditions.

00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:27.196
One is, of course, the
significant events, sunrise

00:26:27.196 --> 00:26:30.866
and sunset, but I am just going
to use 6 p.m. at my example.

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:34.866
And I want to select before.

00:26:34.866 --> 00:26:37.946
I am going to go
ahead and hit save.

00:26:38.996 --> 00:26:41.036
Now I have captured
my first condition.

00:26:41.796 --> 00:26:43.056
Now let's do the
second condition,

00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:45.236
which is the motion
sensor detecting motion.

00:26:45.436 --> 00:26:49.436
Go add my second condition.

00:26:49.436 --> 00:26:51.046
Now I am going to
select characteristic

00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:54.446
because this is an accessory,
which would mean I need

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:57.016
to capture a characteristic
as a source of that condition.

00:26:57.376 --> 00:27:02.616
Select condition,
find my sensor,

00:27:04.016 --> 00:27:07.006
and set motion to be detected.

00:27:07.076 --> 00:27:10.526
I am going to go
back and hit done.

00:27:12.066 --> 00:27:12.416
So there you go.

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:15.496
I have my event trigger, given
it a name, given it the source

00:27:15.496 --> 00:27:18.636
of my event, specified
my two conditions

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:19.626
that both need to be met.

00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:21.096
I tie it all together,

00:27:21.096 --> 00:27:23.466
I just need to associate my
arrive home scene to this.

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:27.186
Let's go down to
the scene section

00:27:27.716 --> 00:27:29.336
and just select "hi, house."

00:27:29.916 --> 00:27:32.986
And go ahead, hit done.

00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:35.416
Now that saves the
entire event trigger.

00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:38.686
Now, let's see this
event trigger in action.

00:27:39.886 --> 00:27:41.306
For that, first I
am going to go ahead

00:27:41.306 --> 00:27:43.196
and unlock my door
and see what happens.

00:27:43.786 --> 00:27:48.766
I have a view over here
that shows the door state

00:27:48.766 --> 00:27:50.576
and the motion sensor so
that it's easier for you

00:27:50.576 --> 00:27:52.266
to see what happens
behind the bridge.

00:27:52.266 --> 00:27:55.696
If I hit unsecured,
which corresponds

00:27:55.696 --> 00:27:57.146
to opening the door,
nothing happened.

00:27:57.146 --> 00:27:58.216
And why is that?

00:27:59.326 --> 00:28:02.156
The door opens, so that causes
the event to be activated.

00:28:02.156 --> 00:28:05.976
It is before 6 p.m. So one
of my conditions was met,

00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:09.336
but the second condition was
not met because, as you can see,

00:28:10.026 --> 00:28:11.586
motion detected is set to no.

00:28:12.186 --> 00:28:15.876
So this is working as expected.

00:28:15.876 --> 00:28:17.776
I don't expect my
scene to be executed.

00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:21.316
Now let's go ahead and close
the door and set the motion

00:28:21.856 --> 00:28:23.246
to detected and see
what happens.

00:28:23.276 --> 00:28:27.476
I am going to go ahead
and unlock the door.

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:28.876
There you go.

00:28:30.156 --> 00:28:33.526
That switched on the lights and
executed my arrive home scene.

00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:34.956
How cool is that?

00:28:35.006 --> 00:28:38.976
This is an awesome feature,
and I work on this every day.

00:28:39.016 --> 00:28:41.016
[Laughter]

00:28:41.016 --> 00:28:45.000
[Applause]

00:28:45.436 --> 00:28:48.766
But what is really
exciting to see this work,

00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:51.596
when I see that light goes
on, it just gives you,

00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:53.846
you know, that happy feeling.

00:28:54.516 --> 00:28:57.036
[Laughter]

00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:01.716
For those of you who have
used the Accessory Simulator,

00:29:01.926 --> 00:29:04.826
you see there's a motion sensor.

00:29:05.396 --> 00:29:07.416
This is new in iOS 9.

00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:10.786
We have added new
categories of accessories.

00:29:11.586 --> 00:29:14.966
To talk about this and
new features we have added

00:29:14.966 --> 00:29:18.126
for our accessory classes,
I'd like to invite Naveen.

00:29:19.516 --> 00:29:25.516
[Applause]

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:37.000
[ Background Sounds ]

00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:38.746
>> NAVEEN KOMMAREDDI:
Thank you, Anush.

00:29:41.096 --> 00:29:42.076
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:44.356
I am Naveen Kommareddi,
and I am here to present

00:29:44.356 --> 00:29:48.976
to you even more features in
iOS 9 for HomeKit accessories.

00:29:49.576 --> 00:29:56.686
Starting with remote access and
new features and enhancements

00:29:56.686 --> 00:29:59.136
for Bluetooth Low Energy
HomeKit accessories

00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:02.196
and new accessory categories.

00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:05.836
So let's get started
with remote access.

00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:09.476
With remote access,
you'd be able

00:30:09.476 --> 00:30:11.746
to control your accessories even

00:30:11.746 --> 00:30:12.736
when you are away
from your house.

00:30:14.056 --> 00:30:16.716
So let's take an example
of a thermostat that works

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:18.036
with HomeKit here in your house.

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:20.456
You would be able to
securely connect to it.

00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:24.116
But what if you are
away from your house?

00:30:24.626 --> 00:30:26.446
How do you control
this thermostat?

00:30:26.446 --> 00:30:28.616
Say you want to come home,
but you want to set it

00:30:28.616 --> 00:30:30.456
to the temperature even
before you come home?

00:30:31.016 --> 00:30:32.216
How do you do that securely?

00:30:32.766 --> 00:30:35.366
Well, in iOS 8, remote
access is supported

00:30:35.556 --> 00:30:39.406
if you have an Apple
TV third generation.

00:30:40.136 --> 00:30:43.676
All you need to do is sign
in with the same Apple ID

00:30:43.886 --> 00:30:46.606
as the one you used
on your iOS device,

00:30:46.926 --> 00:30:51.206
and you'd have secure
access to your accessories.

00:30:52.436 --> 00:30:55.616
Now, this is great, but what
if you don't have an Apple TV?

00:30:56.366 --> 00:30:58.416
Because we know that
not every one

00:30:58.416 --> 00:31:03.006
of our customers may
have an Apple TV.

00:31:05.156 --> 00:31:09.476
[Laughter] So in iOS 9, I
am very excited to announce

00:31:10.446 --> 00:31:13.356
that we support HomeKit
accessory protocol,

00:31:13.356 --> 00:31:14.936
HAP, over iCloud.

00:31:15.516 --> 00:31:19.546
[Applause]

00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:20.306
Thank you.

00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:22.526
Yes, it is really exciting

00:31:22.526 --> 00:31:27.576
because what this means is you
can now control your accessories

00:31:27.576 --> 00:31:30.156
and get notifications from
them no matter where you are,

00:31:30.246 --> 00:31:32.226
and even if you don't
have an Apple TV.

00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:35.086
Let's pause to think
what this really means.

00:31:35.816 --> 00:31:38.516
To accessory manufacturers
who have thought

00:31:38.516 --> 00:31:42.446
about providing secure
and remote access

00:31:42.446 --> 00:31:45.786
to their accessories, you know
it's a hard problem to solve.

00:31:47.036 --> 00:31:50.916
We built and deployed a
dedicated iCloud service

00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:55.576
to securely relay HAP
messages between iOS devices

00:31:55.966 --> 00:31:58.976
and accessories, and we
scaled the infrastructure

00:31:58.976 --> 00:32:05.376
that runs the service to handle
billions of HAP messages.

00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:08.216
And we thought: How can
we make this better?

00:32:09.776 --> 00:32:13.896
So to use this service,
the accessory manufacturers

00:32:13.946 --> 00:32:18.056
and all our customers
will now get it for free.

00:32:20.151 --> 00:32:22.151
[Applause]

00:32:22.286 --> 00:32:23.376
Well, thanks.

00:32:25.296 --> 00:32:28.536
But most importantly,
privacy and security.

00:32:28.996 --> 00:32:33.796
The end-to-end connections
between iOS devices

00:32:34.206 --> 00:32:39.416
and accessories are HAP secure,
and privacy is maintained.

00:32:39.856 --> 00:32:43.946
Even Apple can't see the
content of the communication.

00:32:44.646 --> 00:32:46.586
This is extremely important.

00:32:48.176 --> 00:32:52.536
Now, with HAP support
over iCloud and Apple TV,

00:32:52.746 --> 00:32:55.696
our customers will now
have more ubiquitous access

00:32:56.026 --> 00:32:56.996
to their accessories.

00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:02.686
Now, moving on from remote
access to Bluetooth Low Energy.

00:33:03.306 --> 00:33:07.766
So we are working with
several of our partners

00:33:07.866 --> 00:33:10.166
to bring more Bluetooth
Low Energy accessories

00:33:10.246 --> 00:33:11.656
that that work with HomeKit.

00:33:12.606 --> 00:33:15.026
Let's say a Bluetooth door lock.

00:33:16.526 --> 00:33:21.976
Now, if you are within Bluetooth
LE range within this accessory,

00:33:22.036 --> 00:33:24.096
let's say a door lock,
say 20 to 30 feet,

00:33:24.406 --> 00:33:27.786
you can securely connect
to it and control it.

00:33:28.676 --> 00:33:31.526
But what if you are far
away, like in the corner

00:33:31.526 --> 00:33:32.786
of your house or
in the backyard?

00:33:33.716 --> 00:33:36.686
How do you securely connect to
this accessory and control it?

00:33:37.116 --> 00:33:41.246
Wouldn't it be great to have
a mechanism or a feature

00:33:41.246 --> 00:33:43.686
that would connect these
two endpoints together?

00:33:44.566 --> 00:33:46.716
Well, in iOS 9, you
can do exactly

00:33:46.716 --> 00:33:49.246
that with HAP secure tunneling.

00:33:49.886 --> 00:33:57.776
HAP secure tunneling enables an
intermediate device to associate

00:33:57.776 --> 00:34:04.296
over Bluetooth Low Energy
and expose it as an artifact

00:34:04.296 --> 00:34:08.976
over Wi-Fi to an iOS device.

00:34:09.856 --> 00:34:13.436
Now you have a device that
is a HomeKit accessory

00:34:14.466 --> 00:34:19.186
that provides range extension
with HAP secure tunnelling.

00:34:20.666 --> 00:34:25.846
So what's even better is this
range extender will also be able

00:34:25.846 --> 00:34:28.916
to provide remote access
to this Bluetooth accessory

00:34:28.916 --> 00:34:30.146
and any other Bluetooth
accessory

00:34:30.146 --> 00:34:31.056
that works with HomeKit.

00:34:32.556 --> 00:34:37.596
What this means is not only can
you reach your accessories no

00:34:37.596 --> 00:34:39.085
matter where they
are in the house,

00:34:39.085 --> 00:34:44.136
but you can also reach them
wherever you are, home or away.

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:46.616
Ultimately, privacy
and security.

00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:48.666
The end-to-end connection

00:34:48.876 --> 00:34:51.896
through this intermediate
device is still HAP secure,

00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:54.176
and privacy is maintained

00:34:54.856 --> 00:34:56.896
because this intermediate
device, the range extender,

00:34:57.376 --> 00:34:59.806
cannot see the content
of the communication.

00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:02.696
We didn't stop there.

00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:05.716
We added several
more enhancements,

00:35:06.396 --> 00:35:08.316
starting with notifications.

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:13.216
Your Bluetooth Low Energy
accessories now have full

00:35:13.316 --> 00:35:14.606
support for notifications,

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:17.246
regardless of the
state of connectivity.

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.896
So whether they are
disconnected or connected,

00:35:19.896 --> 00:35:23.336
they can send HAP notifications
to your iOS devices.

00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:24.656
Really useful.

00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:27.956
We also added support
for metadata.

00:35:29.436 --> 00:35:33.626
This way, custom characteristics
can describe themselves fully

00:35:34.136 --> 00:35:35.766
to HomeKit applications.

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:40.706
And finally, we added support
for multiple transports.

00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:46.566
With this, you can now have a
HomeKit accessory that can work

00:35:46.566 --> 00:35:50.086
over IP or Bluetooth
LE simultaneously,

00:35:50.706 --> 00:35:53.796
and the iOS device will
be able to recognize

00:35:54.076 --> 00:35:57.626
that it's the same accessory
regardless of the transport

00:35:57.626 --> 00:36:00.616
that the accessory uses
to communicate with it.

00:36:00.796 --> 00:36:02.006
Really a compelling feature.

00:36:02.566 --> 00:36:08.696
Now, let's move on to the last
topic of our presentation,

00:36:09.256 --> 00:36:11.086
which is accessory categories.

00:36:11.976 --> 00:36:16.646
Last year with iOS 8, we added
support for several accessories

00:36:17.406 --> 00:36:21.016
that are most commonly found in
your house, like your lights,

00:36:21.066 --> 00:36:24.236
fans, switches, plugs,
garage doors, et cetera.

00:36:25.586 --> 00:36:27.256
Now, adding native support

00:36:27.256 --> 00:36:30.896
for accessory categories is an
evolutionary process in iOS,

00:36:31.696 --> 00:36:38.016
and in iOS 9, we added
support for more devices in iOS

00:36:38.016 --> 00:36:42.816
so that you can connect more
accessories in your house.

00:36:44.246 --> 00:36:46.196
Starting with window coverings.

00:36:46.196 --> 00:36:49.186
You can now use iOS to
control your awnings, blinds,

00:36:49.186 --> 00:36:52.746
and shades, and motorized
doors and windows.

00:36:54.056 --> 00:36:56.536
Alarm systems are
also a new category.

00:36:56.816 --> 00:36:59.406
Now, this is a category
that several --

00:36:59.406 --> 00:37:02.216
and alarm system and security
system providers have asked

00:37:02.886 --> 00:37:04.526
for native support, and
which listened to them.

00:37:04.936 --> 00:37:08.786
But we also found that alarm
systems can be really complex

00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:13.156
with a lot of features, but what
we did is to distill the key

00:37:13.156 --> 00:37:16.346
and the most used features
in an alarm system service.

00:37:16.796 --> 00:37:20.216
Now, you as an accessory
manufacturer will be able

00:37:20.216 --> 00:37:23.556
to add more features using
custom characteristics,

00:37:24.086 --> 00:37:25.176
of course.

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:28.956
Alarm systems typically work
hand in hand with sensors,

00:37:29.326 --> 00:37:33.506
so we added support for several
sensor categories: motion,

00:37:33.506 --> 00:37:37.426
air quality, and smoke
being just a few of them.

00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:38.946
And last but not least --

00:37:38.946 --> 00:37:40.636
and this is a category I
am very excited about --

00:37:41.536 --> 00:37:43.026
is programmable switches.

00:37:43.796 --> 00:37:48.716
A programmable switch is a
HomeKit device whose main

00:37:48.716 --> 00:37:52.826
purpose is to generate events.

00:37:52.826 --> 00:37:56.616
iOS makes this accessory
compelling.

00:37:56.976 --> 00:37:58.126
So to understand this better,

00:37:58.256 --> 00:37:59.696
let me walk you through
an example.

00:37:59.696 --> 00:38:04.486
So let's say it's bedtime,
and you're in your bed,

00:38:05.396 --> 00:38:07.926
you stow away your
electronics, charging somewhere,

00:38:08.866 --> 00:38:11.416
but you don't know if
your house is secure.

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:14.296
Your lights are probably off in
some far corner of the house.

00:38:15.356 --> 00:38:16.136
But fret not.

00:38:17.006 --> 00:38:20.706
You have this programmable
switch, nothing

00:38:20.706 --> 00:38:22.156
but a simple switch
with a button.

00:38:22.156 --> 00:38:24.306
Now, you press the button.

00:38:24.886 --> 00:38:25.886
It generates an event.

00:38:26.526 --> 00:38:29.786
And you know now in iOS 9
we support event triggers.

00:38:30.716 --> 00:38:36.676
So our users will be able to
map this event to a trigger,

00:38:37.696 --> 00:38:40.556
which will execute this
beautiful predefined good

00:38:40.556 --> 00:38:41.136
night scene.

00:38:42.616 --> 00:38:44.846
Now, iOS, wherever it is,
wherever the phone is,

00:38:44.926 --> 00:38:47.476
it will get this trigger and
execute all of it magically.

00:38:48.056 --> 00:38:49.226
Powerful but simple.

00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:55.456
Now, programmable switch and
all the other new accessory

00:38:55.456 --> 00:38:58.476
categories are available,
as Anush mentioned,

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:01.096
in our updated version of the
HomeKit Accessory Simulator,

00:39:01.276 --> 00:39:05.226
so that you, as developers,
can develop apps

00:39:05.296 --> 00:39:06.716
to support these new categories.

00:39:07.916 --> 00:39:10.336
The HomeKit Accessory
Simulator is one

00:39:10.336 --> 00:39:13.606
of the several tools
available to you as developers

00:39:13.606 --> 00:39:14.836
and accessory manufacturers.

00:39:15.956 --> 00:39:18.276
We also have HomeKit
Accessory Tester,

00:39:18.686 --> 00:39:22.626
which is also being updated to
support many of the new features

00:39:23.156 --> 00:39:24.226
that we talked about today.

00:39:24.896 --> 00:39:29.246
Now let me talk a minute about
HomeKit Accessory Tester, HAT.

00:39:29.546 --> 00:39:31.986
We urge you, as accessory
manufacturers,

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:36.526
to exclusively use HAT all
through your development cycle

00:39:36.926 --> 00:39:40.896
because this way you will ensure
that your accessory is compliant

00:39:41.306 --> 00:39:46.656
to HomeKit specifications
and also ensure

00:39:46.656 --> 00:39:50.626
that your accessories work with
past and future versions of iOS.

00:39:51.246 --> 00:39:53.566
Now, HAT also provides
the debug information

00:39:54.056 --> 00:39:56.756
that may not be available
to you when you use iOS,

00:39:57.416 --> 00:40:01.206
but the most important reason
is that we use HAT at Apple

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:03.006
to certify your accessories.

00:40:03.506 --> 00:40:07.286
Now, HAT is also
one of the tools

00:40:07.676 --> 00:40:12.296
that is exclusively available to
members of Apple's MFi program.

00:40:13.296 --> 00:40:15.436
Now, if you are already
a member of this program,

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:19.346
then you'd be able to get
updated specs and tools

00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:21.836
in the near future
at the MFi portal.

00:40:23.316 --> 00:40:25.346
If you are not a member
of the MFi program

00:40:26.296 --> 00:40:29.836
and you are making a HomeKit
accessory, you need to enroll

00:40:30.086 --> 00:40:30.936
so that you would be able

00:40:30.936 --> 00:40:33.206
to download the specifications
and tools.

00:40:33.686 --> 00:40:35.476
And here is a link
to get you started.

00:40:37.596 --> 00:40:42.166
Now, in summary, today you
learned about many new features,

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:45.606
like HomeKit and Apple
Watch, event triggers,

00:40:46.036 --> 00:40:48.936
a new way of remote
access, and several features

00:40:48.936 --> 00:40:50.546
for Bluetooth Low
Energy accessories.

00:40:51.386 --> 00:40:54.126
We at Apple are really excited
about all these features,

00:40:54.396 --> 00:40:57.406
and we can't wait to see what
you are going to do with them.

00:40:58.446 --> 00:41:01.676
If you have any more questions,
any questions on HomeKit,

00:41:02.676 --> 00:41:04.546
here's where you can get
more information from.

00:41:05.686 --> 00:41:07.766
Thank you very much for
attending our session.

00:41:08.516 --> 00:41:12.500
[Applause]
