00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:24.266
>> JESSE DONALDSON:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:25.646
Thanks for coming.

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:28.656
My name is Jesse, and I am
responsible for Auto Layout

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:30.386
in the AppKit and
Foundation frameworks.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:33.206
Layout is one of the
most fundamental tasks

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:36.666
that we perform when we build an
application, and Auto Layout is

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.656
about the neatest thing ever,
but sometimes it can seem kind

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.246
of mysterious, and so today I
want to look at a few aspects

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.996
of Auto Layout that are
less well understood and go

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.086
through them in some detail.

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:49.866
This is the second part
of our two-part series,

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.026
and here's a brief list

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:52.916
of the topics we're
going to be looking at.

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:55.056
I would like to start
with the layout cycle.

00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:59.046
You probably know how to
configure your user interface,

00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:03.176
but Auto Layout can still be
a little bit of a black box.

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:04.896
You kind of configure things,

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:07.836
you run your application,
you get some layout.

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.286
Hopefully it's the layout that
you want, but if it's not,

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:12.656
it can be hard to
know where to look.

00:01:13.076 --> 00:01:15.946
So I want to look at what
happens in the middle here,

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:18.646
how we actually go from
having constraints on the view

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:21.156
to having the frames
assigned to those views.

00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:25.306
So here is a high-level
overview of the process.

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:27.846
We start with the application
run loop cheerfully iterating

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.736
until the constraints
change in such a way

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:33.216
that the calculated layout
needs to be different.

00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:36.326
This causes a deferred
layout pass to be scheduled.

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:38.706
When that layout pass
eventually comes around,

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:40.166
we go through the hierarchy

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:41.886
and update all the
frames for the views.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:45.666
This is a little abstract, so
I made a simple example here.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:49.886
The idea is that when we
uncheck this top checkbox,

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:52.846
we'll modify a constraint
to shrink the window

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.966
and hide the checkboxes
on the bottom.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.326
So we start with frames
looking like this.

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:01.576
When we change the constraint,
the layout engine's notion

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:03.386
of where everything is
has already changed,

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.136
but the UI hasn't updated yet.

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:07.576
And then when the
layout pass comes along,

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.436
the UI actually changes to
match what the engine thinks

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:10.795
should be.

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:13.536
So let's talk about
constraint changes.

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.856
The constraints that
you create are converted

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:19.826
to mathematical expressions and
kept inside the Layout Engine.

00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:23.796
So a constraints change
is really just anything

00:02:23.796 --> 00:02:27.046
that affects these expressions,
and so that includes some

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.616
of the obvious things
like activating

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:31.506
or deactivating constraints
or changing the priority

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:34.856
or the constant on a constraint,
but also less obvious things

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.836
like manipulating
the view hierarchy

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:38.986
or reconfiguring certain
kinds of controls.

00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:41.716
Because those may cause
constraint changes indirectly.

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:45.406
So what happens when
a constraint changes?

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:47.516
Well, the first thing
that happens is

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:49.236
that the Layout Engine
will recompute the layout.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:52.826
These expressions are made up of
variables that represent things

00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:56.086
like the origin or the
size of a particular view.

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:58.136
And when we recalculate
the layout,

00:02:58.186 --> 00:03:00.466
these variables may
receive new values.

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.566
When this happens, the views

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:03.976
that they represent
are notified,

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:05.866
and they mark their
superview as needing layout.

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:08.776
This is actually what causes
the deferred layout pass

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:09.416
to be scheduled.

00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:13.666
So if we look at
the example here,

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:17.436
this is where you see
the frame actually change

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:20.226
in the Layout Engine but not
yet in the view hierarchy.

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:24.256
So when the deferred
layout pass comes along,

00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:27.806
the purpose of this, of course,
is to reposition any views

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.096
that are not in the right place.

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:31.516
So when we are finished,
everything is in the right spot.

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:35.136
And a pass is actually a
little bit of a misnomer.

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:37.566
There are a couple of
passes that happen here.

00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:40.656
The first is for
updating constraints.

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:42.716
The idea with this
is to make sure

00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:45.576
that if there are any pending
changes to constraints,

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:48.296
they happen now, before
we go to all the trouble

00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:51.246
to traverse the view hierarchy
and reposition all the views.

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:54.976
And then the second pass is when
we do that view repositioning.

00:03:56.206 --> 00:03:58.016
So let's talk about
update constraints.

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:00.996
Views need to explicitly request

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.846
that their update
constraints method be called.

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:06.766
And this pretty much works the
same way as setNeedsDisplay.

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:08.986
You call
setNeedsUpdateConstraints,

00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:12.336
and then some time later your
update constraints method will

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:14.236
be called.

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:17.916
Really, all this is is a way
for views to have a chance

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:20.016
to make changes to
constraints just in time

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:23.996
for the next layout pass, but
it's often not actually needed.

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.556
All of your initial constraint
setup should ideally happen

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:28.656
inside Interface Builder.

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:30.536
Or if you really
find that you need

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.696
to allocate your
constraints programmatically,

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:34.956
some place like viewDidLoad
is much better.

00:04:35.226 --> 00:04:37.266
Update constraints is really
just for work that needs

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:38.836
to be repeated periodically.

00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:42.236
Also, it's pretty
straightforward

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:45.886
to just change constraints when
you find the need to do that;

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:48.926
whereas, if you take
that logic apart

00:04:48.926 --> 00:04:51.036
from the other code that's
related to it and you move it

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:53.786
into a separate method that
gets executed at a later time,

00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:56.656
your code becomes a lot harder
to follow, so it will be harder

00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:58.466
for you to maintain,
it will be a lot harder

00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:00.286
for other people to understand.

00:05:01.236 --> 00:05:03.696
So when would you need to
use update constraints?

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:06.096
Well, it boils down
to performance.

00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:09.376
If you find that just
changing your constraints

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:10.606
in place is too slow,

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:13.396
then update constraints might
be able to help you out.

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:16.576
It turns out that changing
a constraint inside update

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:17.946
constraints is actually faster

00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:20.826
than changing a constraint
at other times.

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.726
The reason for that is
because the engine is able

00:05:22.726 --> 00:05:25.016
to treat all the constraint
changes that happen

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:26.416
in this pass as a batch.

00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:29.396
This is the same kind of
performance benefit that you get

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:32.426
by calling activate
constraints on an entire array

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:34.846
of constraints as
opposed to activating each

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:36.366
of those constraints
individually.

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:40.466
One of the common
patterns where we find

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.096
that this is really useful
is if you have a view

00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:46.126
that will rebuild constraints
in response to some kind

00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:47.196
of a configuration change.

00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:50.706
It turns out to be very common
for clients of these kinds

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:53.046
of views to need to configure
more than one property,

00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:55.836
so it's very easy
for the view, then,

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:58.276
to end up rebuilding its
constraints multiple times.

00:05:58.336 --> 00:05:59.796
That's just a lot
of wasted work.

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:02.936
It's much more efficient in
these kinds of situations

00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:06.466
to have the view just call
setNeedsUpdateConstraints

00:06:06.876 --> 00:06:09.436
and then when the update
constraints pass comes along,

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:11.126
it can rebuild its
constraints once

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:12.956
to match whatever the
current configuration is.

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:17.066
In any case, once
this pass is complete,

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:19.306
we know the constraints are
all up-to-date, we are ready

00:06:19.306 --> 00:06:21.326
to proceed with repositioning
the views.

00:06:22.276 --> 00:06:25.626
So this is where we
traverse the view hierarchy

00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:28.186
from the top down, and
we'll call layoutSubviews

00:06:28.186 --> 00:06:30.216
on any view marked
as needing layout.

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:33.646
On OS X, this method
is called layout,

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:34.956
but the idea is the same.

00:06:35.496 --> 00:06:39.276
The purpose is for the receiver
to reposition its subviews.

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:41.786
It's not for the receiver
to reposition itself.

00:06:43.626 --> 00:06:46.566
So what the framework
implementation does is it will

00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:48.356
read frames for the subviews

00:06:48.356 --> 00:06:50.316
out of the Layout Engine
and then assign them.

00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:54.106
On the Mac we use setFrame for
this, and on iOS, it's setBounds

00:06:54.106 --> 00:06:56.116
and setCenter, but
the idea is the same.

00:06:57.536 --> 00:06:59.286
So if we look at
the example again,

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:01.586
this is where you
actually see the UI update

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:03.966
to match the frames that
are in the Layout Engine.

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:07.106
One other note about
layoutSubviews:

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:10.666
A lot of people will override
this in order to get some kind

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:13.716
of a custom layout, and it's
fine if you need to do this,

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:16.646
but there are some things
that you need to know

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:18.866
because it can be very
easy to do things here

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:19.946
that can get you into trouble.

00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:21.686
So I want to look at this
in a little more detail.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:26.286
You should really only need
to override layoutSubviews

00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:27.786
if you need some
kind of a layout

00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:31.176
that just can't be
expressed using constraints.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:33.066
If you can find a way to
do it using constraints,

00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:36.056
that's usually more
robust, more trouble free.

00:07:37.906 --> 00:07:43.436
If you do choose to override
this, you should keep in mind

00:07:43.436 --> 00:07:45.636
that we're in the middle of the
layout ceremony at this point.

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:48.046
Some views have already
been laid out,

00:07:48.046 --> 00:07:50.686
other views haven't been, but
they probably will be soon,

00:07:51.106 --> 00:07:53.766
and so it's a bit of
a delicate moment.

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:58.486
There are some special
rules to follow.

00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:01.826
One is that you need to invoke
the superclass implementation.

00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:04.366
We need that for various
bookkeeping purposes.

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:08.306
Also, it's fine to
invalidate the layout of views

00:08:08.306 --> 00:08:11.796
within your subtree, but you
should do that before you call

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:13.346
through to the superclass
implementation.

00:08:13.836 --> 00:08:20.846
Second, you don't want to call
setNeedsUpdateConstraints.

00:08:20.846 --> 00:08:22.526
There was an update
constraints pass.

00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:23.636
We went through that,

00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:27.016
we finished it, and
so we missed it.

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:28.756
If we still need it
now, it's too late.

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:32.426
Also, you want to make sure
you don't invalidate the layout

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:34.166
of views outside your subtree.

00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:37.106
If you do this, it
can be very easy

00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:39.196
to cause layout feedback
loops where the act

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:42.166
of performing layout
actually causes the layout

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:43.086
to be dirtied again.

00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:45.486
Then we can just end
up iterating forever,

00:08:45.486 --> 00:08:46.876
and that's no fun for anybody.

00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:52.306
You'll often find inside
a layoutSubviews override

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:54.526
that you need to modify
constraints in order

00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:57.766
to get your views in the right
places, and that's fine too,

00:08:57.766 --> 00:08:59.236
but again, you need
to be careful.

00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:01.196
It can be difficult to predict

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.996
when you modify a
constraint what other views

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:05.536
in the hierarchy
might be affected.

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:08.066
So if you are changing
constraints, it's very easy

00:09:08.066 --> 00:09:11.346
to accidentally invalidate
layout outside your subtree.

00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:15.656
In any case, assuming that
all this goes smoothly,

00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:18.176
layout cycle is complete at
this point, everything is

00:09:18.176 --> 00:09:20.456
in the right place, and our
constraints change has been

00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:21.066
fully applied.

00:09:22.356 --> 00:09:25.046
So some things to remember
about the layout cycle: First,

00:09:25.456 --> 00:09:27.726
don't expect view frames
to change immediately

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:28.846
when you modify a constraint.

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:31.206
We've just been through
this whole process

00:09:31.206 --> 00:09:32.506
about how that happens later.

00:09:33.056 --> 00:09:36.286
And if you do find that you
need to override layoutSubviews,

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:39.096
be very careful to avoid
layout feedback loops

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:43.116
because they can
be a pain to debug.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:45.986
So next I'd like to talk about
how Auto Layout interacts

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:47.316
with the Legacy Layout system.

00:09:49.106 --> 00:09:52.136
Traditionally we positioned
views just by setting the frame,

00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:54.716
then we have an autoresizingMask

00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:57.916
that specifies how the
view should be resized

00:09:58.506 --> 00:10:00.016
when its superview changes size.

00:10:00.256 --> 00:10:03.406
Then under Auto Layout, we just
do everything with constraints.

00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:06.126
And in fact, subframe
doesn't even work the way you

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:07.396
might expect.

00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:10.406
You can still set the
frame of view, but --

00:10:10.996 --> 00:10:13.196
and it will move
where you put it,

00:10:13.556 --> 00:10:15.796
but that frame may be
overwritten at any time

00:10:15.846 --> 00:10:19.596
if a layout pass comes along and
the framework copies the frame

00:10:19.596 --> 00:10:21.316
from the Layout Engine and
applies it to that view.

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:23.296
The trouble with this is

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:26.156
that sometimes you just
need to set the frame.

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:28.706
For example, if you are
overriding layoutSubviews,

00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:31.506
you may need to set the
frame of those views.

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.756
And so luckily, there's
a flag for that.

00:10:35.356 --> 00:10:37.256
It's called
translatesAutoResizingMask

00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:38.146
IntoConstraints [without space].

00:10:38.496 --> 00:10:41.096
It's a bit of a mouthful, but it
pretty much does what it says.

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:43.256
It makes views behave
the way that they did

00:10:43.346 --> 00:10:46.426
under the Legacy Layout system
but in an Auto Layout world.

00:10:47.306 --> 00:10:51.206
So if you set the frame
on a view with this flag,

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.716
the framework will actually
generate constraints

00:10:53.776 --> 00:10:56.336
that enforce that frame
in the Layout Engine.

00:10:57.246 --> 00:11:00.436
What this means is that you
can set the frame as often

00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:02.626
as you like, and you
can count on Auto Layout

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:05.206
to keep the view
where you put it.

00:11:05.476 --> 00:11:08.566
Furthermore, these constraints
actually implement the behavior

00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.276
of the autoresizingMask.

00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:14.366
So if you have some portion of
your application, for example,

00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:16.896
that isn't updated to Auto
Layout yet and you are depending

00:11:16.896 --> 00:11:18.526
on this auto-resizing behavior,

00:11:18.876 --> 00:11:20.676
it should still behave
the way that you expect.

00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:25.586
And finally, by actually
using the Auto Layout Engine

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:28.966
to enforce the frame that
you set, it makes it possible

00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:31.646
to use constraints to
position other views relative

00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:33.616
to this one.

00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:35.476
Since you set the frame,
you can't move the view

00:11:35.476 --> 00:11:38.996
around itself, but if we
didn't tell the Layout Engine

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:42.226
where this view needed to be,
then as soon as you reference it

00:11:42.226 --> 00:11:44.996
with a constraint, we
can run into problems

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:48.576
where you'll see the size or
the origin collapse to zero.

00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:51.396
And that kind of behavior
can be very confusing

00:11:51.526 --> 00:11:53.966
if you are not expecting it.

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:58.666
So another note here is
that when you are planning

00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:00.686
to position your view
using constraints,

00:12:00.916 --> 00:12:02.226
you need to make sure
that this is off.

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:04.516
And if you are building your
UI in Interface Builder,

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.506
it will take good care of you
and set this flag appropriately.

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:10.416
But if you are allocating
your UI programmatically,

00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:12.176
this actually defaults
to being on.

00:12:12.216 --> 00:12:14.786
It needs to because
there's just a lot of code

00:12:14.786 --> 00:12:16.536
that allocates a view
and then expects it

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:18.816
to behave in a certain way.

00:12:19.466 --> 00:12:22.966
So it defaults to on, and if
you are allocating your UI

00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:24.896
programmatically and you
forget to turn this off,

00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:27.246
it can cause a number
of unexpected problems.

00:12:27.806 --> 00:12:29.536
Let's look at what
happens if you forget.

00:12:30.356 --> 00:12:32.536
So this is a pretty
simple piece of code.

00:12:32.536 --> 00:12:34.606
We just allocate a
button and configure it,

00:12:34.606 --> 00:12:36.596
and then we create
two constraints

00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:39.106
that position this button
ten points from the top,

00:12:39.256 --> 00:12:41.046
ten points from the left.

00:12:41.046 --> 00:12:42.666
So it's very straightforward,

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:44.226
but if you run it,
this is what you get.

00:12:44.766 --> 00:12:46.736
The window is too small,
it doesn't behave the way

00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:48.736
that you expect, the button
is nowhere to be seen.

00:12:49.776 --> 00:12:52.206
And you get all this
spew in the console.

00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:56.266
So there's actually a hint
about the problem in this spew.

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:58.726
You can see this is an
NSAutoresizingMaskLayout

00:12:58.726 --> 00:12:59.196
Constraint [without space].

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:01.766
This is the class
of layout constraint

00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:04.306
that the framework
will create for views

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:06.146
that have
translatesAutoResizingMask

00:13:06.146 --> 00:13:07.196
IntoConstraints [without
space] set.

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:11.336
What actually happened
here is because we forgot

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:15.246
to clear this flag, the
framework generated constraints

00:13:15.246 --> 00:13:16.896
for the initial frame
on this button.

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:19.886
That frame was empty, the origin
and the size were both zero,

00:13:20.476 --> 00:13:23.006
so it's not very useful,
but the real problem came

00:13:23.006 --> 00:13:24.796
up when we then added
constraints to try

00:13:24.796 --> 00:13:27.016
to position the button at 10,10.

00:13:27.196 --> 00:13:29.926
It can't be at 0,0 and
10,10 simultaneously,

00:13:29.926 --> 00:13:32.296
so the Layout Engine
suddenly can't satisfy all the

00:13:32.296 --> 00:13:35.146
constraints, and things go
wrong in unexpected ways.

00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:39.976
If we go back to the code
and we just add a line

00:13:39.976 --> 00:13:43.896
to clear this flag, then
things get much better.

00:13:43.896 --> 00:13:46.696
We get the layout that we
are expecting, the button is

00:13:46.696 --> 00:13:50.476
in the right place, the window
behaves the way we would expect.

00:13:50.586 --> 00:13:52.876
So some things to keep in mind

00:13:52.876 --> 00:13:55.296
about translatesAutoResizingMask
IntoConstraints [without space]:

00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:58.726
You usually won't need this
flag at all, but if you find

00:13:58.726 --> 00:14:00.816
that you have a view
that you need to position

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:04.166
by setting the frame directly,
then this will help you out.

00:14:04.916 --> 00:14:07.236
And again, if you are
planning to position things

00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:09.956
with constraints, you need
to make sure that this is off

00:14:09.956 --> 00:14:12.896
if you are not using
Interface Builder.

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.996
So next I'd like to talk
about constraint creation.

00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:20.476
We can do that most easily,
I think, just by looking

00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:22.226
at the code we just
had up on the screen,

00:14:22.626 --> 00:14:24.406
specifically the
piece at the end,

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.686
where we are building
these constraints.

00:14:26.936 --> 00:14:30.336
This is the same constraint
factory method that we've had

00:14:30.386 --> 00:14:31.926
since the beginning
of Auto Layout,

00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:33.096
and it's perfectly effective,

00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:35.266
but it can be a little
bit awkward to use.

00:14:35.946 --> 00:14:37.676
The code is pretty verbose,

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:40.066
and it's a little bit
difficult to read.

00:14:40.066 --> 00:14:42.096
What we are really trying
to express here is just

00:14:42.126 --> 00:14:44.226
that we want to position the
button ten points from the top

00:14:44.346 --> 00:14:45.546
and ten points from the left.

00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:48.376
But in order to understand
that, you need to read

00:14:48.376 --> 00:14:49.886
through this code
pretty carefully and kind

00:14:49.886 --> 00:14:50.866
of put the pieces together.

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:54.246
So in the new release
of OS X and iOS,

00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:56.806
we are introducing a
new, more concise syntax

00:14:56.906 --> 00:14:57.956
for creating constraints.

00:14:58.536 --> 00:14:59.926
Here is what it looks like.

00:15:00.476 --> 00:15:03.966
This syntax works using
objects called layout anchors.

00:15:04.516 --> 00:15:10.596
[Applause]

00:15:11.096 --> 00:15:12.956
Thanks. I am glad you like them.

00:15:13.031 --> 00:15:15.031
[Laughter]

00:15:15.046 --> 00:15:16.816
A layout anchor represents
a particular attribute

00:15:16.926 --> 00:15:20.376
of a particular view, and
anchor objects expose a variety

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:23.426
of factory methods for creating
different forms of constraints.

00:15:24.026 --> 00:15:26.956
So in this case we see we are
constraining the top anchor

00:15:26.956 --> 00:15:31.656
to be the same as the top
anchor of the view plus ten.

00:15:31.656 --> 00:15:33.416
If you are working
in Objective-C still,

00:15:33.416 --> 00:15:35.096
they are available
there as well,

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:37.156
and the difference is
even more striking.

00:15:37.156 --> 00:15:41.376
We go from nearly seven
lines down to just two.

00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:43.296
So this new syntax
still conforms

00:15:43.296 --> 00:15:46.036
to all our naming conventions,
but it reads a lot more

00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:48.136
like an expression and, I
think, makes it a lot easier

00:15:48.136 --> 00:15:49.706
to see the intent of the code.

00:15:50.956 --> 00:15:53.596
All valid forms of constraints
can be created using this

00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:57.706
syntax, and you'll actually even
get compiler errors for many

00:15:57.706 --> 00:15:59.396
of the invalid forms
of constraints.

00:16:00.216 --> 00:16:03.726
So at the moment, you only
get the errors in Objective-C,

00:16:03.726 --> 00:16:05.296
but they will be
coming to Swift as well.

00:16:06.406 --> 00:16:08.676
For example, it doesn't
make sense to say

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:11.606
that the leading edge
of a view should be 100

00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:14.486
because there's no context in
which to interpret that 100.

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:17.236
So you get an error that
this method isn't available

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:20.096
on a location anchor.

00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:22.996
Similarly, it doesn't make
sense to say the leading edge

00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:25.186
of your view is the same as
the width of a different view.

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:29.096
Locations and sizes are
fundamentally incompatible types

00:16:29.236 --> 00:16:34.856
in Auto Layout, so you get
an incompatible pointer type.

00:16:34.946 --> 00:16:37.866
So previously, these
things were still errors,

00:16:38.156 --> 00:16:39.676
but they would only
show up at runtime,

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:42.686
so I think making them compile
time errors will help us all get

00:16:42.686 --> 00:16:44.946
our constraints right
the first time,

00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:47.156
as well as write more readable,
more maintainable code.

00:16:49.516 --> 00:16:54.346
[Applause]

00:16:54.846 --> 00:16:58.096
So next I'd like to talk about
constraining negative space.

00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:00.576
There are a few different
kinds of layouts that come

00:17:00.576 --> 00:17:03.546
up from time to time where it's
not immediately obvious how

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:04.156
to achieve them.

00:17:04.685 --> 00:17:06.215
Here's a couple examples.

00:17:06.215 --> 00:17:10.266
In the first case here, the goal
is to make sure that the space

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:11.896
between these buttons
remains the same

00:17:12.076 --> 00:17:13.376
when the window is resized.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.165
And in the bottom, we
have an image and a label,

00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:20.646
and we want to center
them as a group rather

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:23.406
than center each piece of
the content individually.

00:17:24.156 --> 00:17:25.596
So it turns out that
the solution

00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:27.576
to these layout problems
is the same,

00:17:27.965 --> 00:17:29.486
and that's to use dummy views.

00:17:30.096 --> 00:17:33.096
We actually allocate empty
views, and we constrain them

00:17:33.096 --> 00:17:34.916
to fill the spaces
between the buttons.

00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:37.246
Once we have views
in these spots,

00:17:37.636 --> 00:17:40.006
we can use an equal width
constraint to make sure

00:17:40.006 --> 00:17:43.706
that their size remains the
same as the window is resized.

00:17:43.706 --> 00:17:46.106
And in the bottom case,
we can do the same thing.

00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:49.286
We use an empty view, and
we constrain it to the edges

00:17:49.286 --> 00:17:50.686
of the image and the label,

00:17:50.686 --> 00:17:53.026
and then we can place
a centering constraint

00:17:53.116 --> 00:17:55.626
on that empty view
rather than on any

00:17:55.626 --> 00:17:57.156
of the content views themselves.

00:17:57.916 --> 00:18:00.646
So this works, and it's how
we've traditionally solved these

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:03.546
layout problems, but
it's a little bit

00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:04.976
of an obscure trick, right?

00:18:04.976 --> 00:18:07.836
And it's also inefficient,
especially on iOS,

00:18:07.836 --> 00:18:09.876
where every view has a
layer associated with it.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.056
And so in the new release,

00:18:12.056 --> 00:18:16.796
we are exposing a new public
class for layout guides.

00:18:17.776 --> 00:18:20.366
A layout guide simply
represents a rectangle

00:18:20.416 --> 00:18:21.136
in the Layout Engine.

00:18:21.986 --> 00:18:23.756
They're very easy to use.

00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:27.496
All you need to do is
allocate them and then add them

00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:30.046
to an owning view, and then
you can constrain them just

00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:30.856
like you can a view.

00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:33.106
They expose anchor
objects, so they work

00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:35.186
with the new constraint
creation syntax,

00:18:35.346 --> 00:18:36.866
but you can also just pass them

00:18:37.436 --> 00:18:39.636
to the existing constraint
factory methods.

00:18:39.696 --> 00:18:42.336
So they will work with
visual format language

00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:42.946
and things like that.

00:18:44.076 --> 00:18:46.156
We are converting
existing layout guides

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:52.006
to use these internally, and
here is a good example of that.

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:55.336
UIView, you may notice, doesn't
actually expose layout anchors

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:56.546
for the margin attributes.

00:18:57.066 --> 00:19:00.076
Instead, UI View has a
new layout margins guide.

00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:02.786
This layout guide just
represents the area

00:19:02.786 --> 00:19:04.546
of the view inside the margins.

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:08.776
And so if you need to constrain
something to the margins,

00:19:08.776 --> 00:19:11.746
it's easiest to just go
through this layout guide.

00:19:12.456 --> 00:19:16.216
So layout guides don't really
enable any fundamentally

00:19:16.216 --> 00:19:16.886
new behavior.

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:20.226
You can do all of these
things today using views.

00:19:20.706 --> 00:19:22.536
But they let you solve
these kinds of problems

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:24.916
in a much more lightweight
manner and also

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:28.456
without cluttering your
view hierarchy with views

00:19:28.456 --> 00:19:29.936
that don't actually
need to draw.

00:19:31.386 --> 00:19:35.736
So next I'd like to invite Kasia
back on stage to talk to you

00:19:35.736 --> 00:19:38.026
about some debugging
strategies for problems

00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:38.866
that come up with Auto Layout.

00:19:39.516 --> 00:19:46.406
[Applause]

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:47.256
>> KASIA WAWER: Hello.

00:19:47.766 --> 00:19:49.666
I saw some of you
this morning, I think.

00:19:50.116 --> 00:19:50.816
My name is Kasia.

00:19:50.906 --> 00:19:53.826
I am on the iOS Keyboards Team,
and I am here to talk to you

00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:55.936
about debugging your
layout, what you should do

00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:56.896
when something goes wrong.

00:19:57.616 --> 00:19:59.976
Those of you who have used
Auto Layout in the past --

00:19:59.976 --> 00:20:02.946
which I hope is most of you --
have probably run into something

00:20:02.946 --> 00:20:07.136
like this: You design a
UI, and it's beautiful,

00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:09.086
and you're trying to
implement it in your code,

00:20:09.086 --> 00:20:10.596
and you put in all your
constraints carefully,

00:20:10.596 --> 00:20:11.346
and you adjust things.

00:20:11.686 --> 00:20:13.696
And you hit build and
run, and this happens.

00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:17.336
Totally the wrong thing,
and in the debugger,

00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:19.796
you see something like this.

00:20:20.056 --> 00:20:22.056
That's a lot of text; it can
be a little intimidating.

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:24.006
But it's actually a
really useful log.

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:28.466
And this happens when you hit an
unsatisfiable constraint error.

00:20:28.946 --> 00:20:31.006
The engine has looked at the set
of constraints you've given it

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.916
and decided that it can't
actually solve your layout

00:20:33.916 --> 00:20:35.836
because something is
conflicting with something else,

00:20:36.286 --> 00:20:37.936
so it needs to break
one of your constraints

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.616
in order to solve your view.

00:20:40.016 --> 00:20:43.136
And so it throws this error
to tell you what it did,

00:20:43.946 --> 00:20:47.226
and you know, then you need
to go and dig in and find

00:20:47.226 --> 00:20:48.416
that extra competing constraint.

00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:51.306
So let's try reading
this log a little bit.

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:54.206
So here's the view we just
saw and the log we got.

00:20:54.206 --> 00:20:55.936
We've moved some
stuff from the top

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.366
to make it fit on the screen.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:00.296
But the first place to start
is by looking at the bottom.

00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:03.156
The last thing you
see is the constraint

00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:04.126
that was actually broken.

00:21:04.626 --> 00:21:06.936
This is not necessarily the
constraint that's causing the

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:09.736
problem but the one the
engine had to break in order

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:12.226
to solve your layout, so it's
a really good place to start.

00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:15.226
You start with checking
translatesAutoResizingMask

00:21:15.226 --> 00:21:16.486
IntoConstraints [without
space] on that view.

00:21:16.906 --> 00:21:19.776
As you saw with Jesse's
example, that will show up also

00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:21.596
in the log, but it's
usually a good thing

00:21:21.596 --> 00:21:23.116
to make sure you've
done that first.

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:26.626
In this case, we have an
aspect ratio constraint

00:21:26.626 --> 00:21:27.726
on Saturn that was broken.

00:21:28.436 --> 00:21:30.146
So let's highlight that
higher up in the log.

00:21:30.146 --> 00:21:32.096
It will show up in
the log itself.

00:21:32.096 --> 00:21:36.306
The next thing to do is to
find the other constraints

00:21:36.306 --> 00:21:38.186
that are affecting that view
that show up in the log.

00:21:39.026 --> 00:21:42.856
So in this case, we next see a
leading to superview constraint

00:21:42.856 --> 00:21:46.396
and a trailing to superview
constraint, and one to the top,

00:21:47.346 --> 00:21:49.256
and then one to the
label view underneath it.

00:21:50.216 --> 00:21:51.106
And all of these are fine.

00:21:51.106 --> 00:21:52.686
None of these are
directly conflicting.

00:21:53.316 --> 00:21:55.906
So the next thing to look at
are the views it's tied to,

00:21:55.936 --> 00:21:56.916
in this case, the label.

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:00.336
So this label has the same
constraint that ties it

00:22:00.336 --> 00:22:03.446
to the bottom of Saturn, and the
next constraint it has is one

00:22:03.446 --> 00:22:04.896
that ties it to the
top of a superview.

00:22:04.896 --> 00:22:08.076
And this is a problem because
Saturn is supposed to be more

00:22:08.076 --> 00:22:10.616
than 100 points tall, and
this constraint is telling it

00:22:10.616 --> 00:22:11.136
to be that way.

00:22:11.776 --> 00:22:14.626
You'll notice that
the constraint next

00:22:14.706 --> 00:22:19.386
to the label there tells you
exactly what the constraint

00:22:19.386 --> 00:22:20.836
looks like in something
very similar

00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:23.166
to the visual format language
that you may have used

00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:24.506
for creating your
constraints in the past.

00:22:24.686 --> 00:22:27.416
So we see that it's 100 points
from the top of the superview,

00:22:27.906 --> 00:22:29.706
and again, since Saturn
needs to be more than that,

00:22:30.086 --> 00:22:31.276
it had to break one
of the constraints

00:22:31.276 --> 00:22:32.256
in order to solve your layout.

00:22:33.036 --> 00:22:35.246
So it's actually not
that difficult to read.

00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:38.726
Now, I have made it
a little bit easier

00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:41.576
because you probably are used
to seeing constraints logs

00:22:41.576 --> 00:22:44.076
that look more like this,
where there's just a bunch

00:22:44.076 --> 00:22:47.586
of memory addresses and class
names and there's nothing really

00:22:47.586 --> 00:22:49.846
to tell you what's what unless
you have nav text in your view.

00:22:50.766 --> 00:22:52.646
It's much easier if it
looks something like this.

00:22:53.736 --> 00:22:55.236
In order to achieve
that, all you need

00:22:55.236 --> 00:22:57.156
to do is add identifiers
to your constraints.

00:22:57.766 --> 00:22:59.096
And there's a couple
easy ways to do that.

00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:02.026
If you are using
explicit constraints,

00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:02.886
it's just a property.

00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:06.446
I suggest naming the
identifier the same thing

00:23:06.446 --> 00:23:08.396
as you are naming your
constraint just so it's easy

00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:10.756
to find later if you need
to dig it out of your code.

00:23:11.376 --> 00:23:15.026
But you can name it anything
you want, so go forth and do so.

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:18.046
If you are using Visual Format
Language, you get an array back,

00:23:18.046 --> 00:23:19.946
you don't get a constraint
back, so you have to loop

00:23:19.946 --> 00:23:22.626
through that array and set the
identifier on every constraint.

00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:25.086
You can set the same
identifier on every constraint

00:23:25.086 --> 00:23:27.026
in the array, and that's
generally a good idea.

00:23:27.366 --> 00:23:29.636
If you try to pick out the
individual constraints there

00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:32.096
and set identifiers on them
and you change something

00:23:32.096 --> 00:23:33.786
in that array later, the
ordering is going to change

00:23:33.786 --> 00:23:34.666
and you are going
to have to go back

00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.396
and change your identifier
order as well.

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:40.806
Plus once you see that phrase
in your log, you know exactly

00:23:40.806 --> 00:23:42.256
where you are going to
look for the problem,

00:23:42.256 --> 00:23:45.356
so you don't really need to have
each specific constraint laid

00:23:45.356 --> 00:23:45.706
out there.

00:23:46.446 --> 00:23:47.476
Finally, Interface Builder

00:23:48.086 --> 00:23:50.646
in the constraint inspector just
has an identifier property right

00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:53.226
there, so that's super easy.

00:23:54.276 --> 00:23:54.516
Let's see.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:58.106
So let's talk about, you
know, understanding this log,

00:23:58.546 --> 00:24:01.516
and making it even easier
to know what's going on.

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:06.216
First, if you set accessibility
identifiers on your views,

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:08.936
those identifiers will
show up in the log paired

00:24:08.936 --> 00:24:10.816
with those views, so you
can find the view you are

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:11.246
looking for.

00:24:11.246 --> 00:24:13.946
That's how I got Saturn from
the constraints we saw earlier.

00:24:13.976 --> 00:24:16.396
It has an accessibility
identifier called Saturn.

00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:19.516
You can also set identifiers
on our new layout guides,

00:24:20.076 --> 00:24:22.286
and that's just a flat-out
identifier property,

00:24:22.286 --> 00:24:25.216
nothing special about it, which
makes it super easy, again,

00:24:25.696 --> 00:24:27.316
to debug layouts that
are using layout guides,

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:29.176
and since they're awesome I'm
pretty sure all of you are going

00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:30.196
to be using them at some point.

00:24:30.926 --> 00:24:31.956
Add them as you go.

00:24:32.806 --> 00:24:35.946
If you try and take a very
complex layout now and throw all

00:24:35.946 --> 00:24:37.546
of your identifiers
in, you can do it.

00:24:37.546 --> 00:24:38.366
It will take time.

00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:41.046
It's worth it because you will
be able to read this log later.

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:43.916
But if you are doing it as
you go, that's a lot less work

00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:45.996
down the road because
you can't really predict

00:24:45.996 --> 00:24:47.706
when you are going to run into
this problem, necessarily,

00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:50.246
and you want to have it
there when you need it.

00:24:51.046 --> 00:24:54.056
Finally, if you have an
unsatisfiable constraints log

00:24:54.056 --> 00:24:55.346
that just has too
much information,

00:24:55.716 --> 00:24:57.896
you have a very complex
layout, there are hundreds

00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:59.986
of lines there, you
can take that view

00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:02.136
at the bottom especially and
other views that you are looking

00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:04.716
at and actually view the
constraints affecting them one

00:25:04.716 --> 00:25:05.866
at a time in the debugger.

00:25:06.496 --> 00:25:06.916
On iOS,

00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:08.626
it's constraintsAffectingLayout
ForAxis [without space],

00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:09.776
and on OS X,

00:25:09.776 --> 00:25:11.896
it's constraintsAffectingLayout
ForOrientation [without space].

00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:15.256
And that will tell you just the
constraints that are affecting

00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:18.926
that view in one
axis or another.

00:25:19.546 --> 00:25:23.666
So let's look at how
that works for here.

00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:31.456
So I've got that view
that we just looked at.

00:25:31.716 --> 00:25:33.036
We see the same log down here.

00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:35.846
But let's wipe that out for the
moment because I really want

00:25:35.846 --> 00:25:38.796
to show you how else
to look at this.

00:25:38.866 --> 00:25:41.146
I have set a two-finger
double-tap just to break here

00:25:41.146 --> 00:25:42.286
so I don't have to
use memory addresses.

00:25:42.286 --> 00:25:43.836
I can use the names I've set up.

00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:49.186
So we are going to break into
the debugger here and ask it

00:25:49.366 --> 00:25:54.906
to print out Saturn's
constraintsAffectingLayout

00:25:54.906 --> 00:25:56.546
ForAxis [without space]
and its vertical axis.

00:25:57.456 --> 00:26:00.976
Vertical is 1, horizontal is 0.

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:02.786
If you use the wrong one, you
only have one other option,

00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:04.626
so it's pretty easy
to get back to it.

00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:07.336
So here we see the
view has a layout guide

00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:10.276
at the top, and that's fine.

00:26:10.506 --> 00:26:11.726
That's the view's constraints.

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:14.406
One of the other benefits
to naming your constraints

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:15.876
in your views is that
you know pretty quickly

00:26:15.876 --> 00:26:18.106
which ones were set up
outside of your constraints

00:26:18.106 --> 00:26:19.306
and which ones were
set up by you.

00:26:19.596 --> 00:26:22.896
So our vertical layout for
Saturn tells us that it's tied

00:26:22.896 --> 00:26:23.896
to the top layout guide.

00:26:24.946 --> 00:26:25.386
That's great.

00:26:25.386 --> 00:26:29.176
It also tells us that Saturn is
tied to the label underneath it.

00:26:30.146 --> 00:26:32.306
And then in another
constraint that affects Saturn

00:26:32.376 --> 00:26:33.836
but isn't directly
related to Saturn,

00:26:34.136 --> 00:26:36.466
we see that constraint
that's tying the label

00:26:36.466 --> 00:26:37.356
to the top of the view.

00:26:37.866 --> 00:26:39.806
Since it doesn't
mention Saturn anywhere,

00:26:39.806 --> 00:26:42.036
that's a pretty good clue
that it's the wrong one --

00:26:42.376 --> 00:26:43.866
also that whole Saturn
is supposed to be more

00:26:43.866 --> 00:26:46.256
than a hundred points thing,
which I happen to know

00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:48.346
since I wrote this code.

00:26:48.596 --> 00:26:51.866
Now that I've got this
nice handy label here,

00:26:51.866 --> 00:26:54.596
I can simply search for
it, find the constraint

00:26:54.596 --> 00:26:55.916
that I made, and there we go.

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:58.246
I have tied it to the top
anchor by a hundred points.

00:26:58.956 --> 00:27:01.666
And find out where
it's activated.

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:04.786
And get rid of it.

00:27:05.036 --> 00:27:05.726
Build again.

00:27:06.446 --> 00:27:08.706
That's much better.

00:27:08.706 --> 00:27:10.136
That's exactly what
I was looking for.

00:27:10.556 --> 00:27:12.906
And so it's really
easy to kind of drill

00:27:12.906 --> 00:27:13.906
down into those problems,

00:27:13.906 --> 00:27:15.546
even when you have a
very complex layout,

00:27:15.716 --> 00:27:18.966
if you are using
identifiers properly.

00:27:19.906 --> 00:27:23.476
So where are we with this log?

00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:25.906
Start from the bottom.

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:28.416
Finding the constraint that
was broken gives you a lot

00:27:28.416 --> 00:27:31.496
of information about
why it was broken.

00:27:31.496 --> 00:27:34.366
Check translatesAutoResizingMask
IntoConstraints [without

00:27:34.366 --> 00:27:34.636
space] first.

00:27:35.096 --> 00:27:37.686
It is the culprit
in many situations.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:41.126
Set identifiers on both your
constraints and your views,

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.946
and finally, if the log
is just too complex,

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:44.686
go

00:27:44.686 --> 00:27:46.346
for constraintsAffectingLayout
ForAxis [without space]

00:27:46.426 --> 00:27:47.176
to narrow it down.

00:27:48.276 --> 00:27:53.486
Okay. So that's what
happens when the engine looks

00:27:53.486 --> 00:27:57.286
at your constraints and knows
that it can't get a solution.

00:27:57.286 --> 00:27:59.256
There is no solution that
fits all of your constraints.

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:01.766
But what happens if it has
more than one solution?

00:28:02.086 --> 00:28:03.456
That's when we hit ambiguity.

00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.646
This is our final
mystery, so congratulations

00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:07.496
for making it this far.

00:28:07.966 --> 00:28:09.166
We don't have that
much farther to go.

00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:10.346
Let's see.

00:28:10.466 --> 00:28:11.686
So, ambiguous layouts.

00:28:11.936 --> 00:28:13.726
A couple of possible causes

00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:16.986
of ambiguous layouts are
simply too few constraints.

00:28:17.866 --> 00:28:21.526
If you are doing a planets'
layout like this and you know

00:28:21.526 --> 00:28:22.566
that you want Saturn
in the middle

00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:25.636
but your horizontal constraints
aren't set up properly,

00:28:25.796 --> 00:28:27.086
the view may have to
guess where to put it.

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:29.326
Again, reminder, it
should be in the middle.

00:28:29.326 --> 00:28:32.496
The engine put it
off to the side.

00:28:32.866 --> 00:28:35.236
The other solution it has for
it is off to the other side,

00:28:35.326 --> 00:28:37.006
and it never actually
lands in the middle.

00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:39.696
And that can be a problem
because if it doesn't know

00:28:39.696 --> 00:28:41.196
where to put it, it's just
going to put it somewhere.

00:28:41.316 --> 00:28:42.816
That's not what you want.

00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:44.836
You need to go back and add
constraints on that view.

00:28:45.596 --> 00:28:47.276
Another cause of
ambiguous layouts is

00:28:47.276 --> 00:28:48.286
conflicting priorities.

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:51.446
We talked about this a
little bit in Part 1.

00:28:51.446 --> 00:28:54.386
At the bottom of this view that
we just fixed here, you will see

00:28:54.386 --> 00:28:56.676
that it can actually end up in
a situation where the text field

00:28:56.676 --> 00:28:59.136
and button are kind of
the wrong proportions.

00:28:59.136 --> 00:29:00.466
I want it to look
more like this,

00:29:02.356 --> 00:29:04.606
where the text field is
taking up most of the view.

00:29:05.196 --> 00:29:07.606
And the reason that it ended up
that way is that the engine had

00:29:07.606 --> 00:29:10.166
to make a choice between
those two layouts for me.

00:29:11.086 --> 00:29:13.576
And it did that because the
content hugging priorities

00:29:13.576 --> 00:29:15.316
on these two views are the same.

00:29:15.316 --> 00:29:18.066
They are both 250, and I
don't have any other way --

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:19.926
I am not telling the
engine any other way

00:29:19.926 --> 00:29:21.966
to size those views
horizontally.

00:29:22.436 --> 00:29:24.116
So it had to kind of take
a guess, and it guessed

00:29:24.216 --> 00:29:27.416
that maybe I wanted the text
view to hug its content closely

00:29:27.726 --> 00:29:29.166
and go ahead and let
the label spread out,

00:29:29.716 --> 00:29:30.836
but I really wanted
it to do this

00:29:30.966 --> 00:29:32.436
and hug the button
content closely.

00:29:33.106 --> 00:29:36.396
So as I -- this is going to
be repeat for a couple of you,

00:29:36.396 --> 00:29:38.186
but if the content
hugging priority

00:29:38.186 --> 00:29:40.826
on the button is set lower
than that on the text field,

00:29:41.306 --> 00:29:45.596
the edges of the view are able
to stretch away from its content

00:29:45.596 --> 00:29:48.086
because it's less important
that it hug its content closely.

00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:49.606
Or you are telling the
engine it's less important

00:29:49.606 --> 00:29:51.156
that that view hug
its content closely.

00:29:51.876 --> 00:29:54.676
Meanwhile, if you set it above,
the content hugging priority

00:29:54.676 --> 00:29:57.966
of the text view, the
button now hugs it closely

00:29:58.116 --> 00:29:59.286
and the text field stretches.

00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:02.086
This is consistently how the
engine will solve the layout

00:30:02.086 --> 00:30:03.546
in this particular circumstance.

00:30:03.696 --> 00:30:06.956
So if you set these priorities
properly, you can resolve some

00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:09.866
of these ambiguous
layouts that you run into.

00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:13.366
We have a couple of tools
for resolving ambiguity.

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:15.936
Interface Builder
is a big help here.

00:30:16.286 --> 00:30:20.546
It has these little icons on the
edge, and if you click on those,

00:30:20.676 --> 00:30:22.636
it will tell you what's
going on with your layout

00:30:22.636 --> 00:30:23.626
that it doesn't understand.

00:30:24.626 --> 00:30:26.366
And in many cases,
it will tell you

00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:29.906
that you are missing constraints
and what it can't solve for.

00:30:30.276 --> 00:30:32.416
I need constraints for
the Y position or height.

00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:37.566
When you build and run an
app that has this issue,

00:30:38.006 --> 00:30:41.796
you are going to end up
with these views somewhere

00:30:41.796 --> 00:30:45.366
in the Y-axis, where the engine
kind of decided it had to go

00:30:45.366 --> 00:30:46.796
because it didn't have
any information from you.

00:30:47.556 --> 00:30:48.376
That makes it really easy.

00:30:48.376 --> 00:30:52.156
When you are not using Interface
Builder or when you get passed

00:30:52.156 --> 00:30:53.316
and you are still
running into this,

00:30:53.316 --> 00:30:55.546
we have a really cool method
called autolayoutTrace,

00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:59.706
and you just use that in
the debugger on a view,

00:30:59.786 --> 00:31:03.546
and it will just tell you in
all caps that you have a view

00:31:03.546 --> 00:31:05.626
that has an ambiguous
layout, and you can then go

00:31:05.626 --> 00:31:07.896
about diagnosing the
problem with that view.

00:31:08.856 --> 00:31:11.246
We also have the view
debugger in the debug menu,

00:31:11.976 --> 00:31:15.556
which will allow you to view the
frames and the alignment recs

00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:17.816
that the layout engine has
calculated for your view.

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:19.436
It will look something
like this.

00:31:19.436 --> 00:31:20.966
It will just draw
it right on the view

00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:22.106
that it's looking at right now.

00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:25.236
Here you can see that
Saturn, who is supposed

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:28.026
to have an alignment rect
that comes very closely

00:31:28.026 --> 00:31:29.686
to its content, is
stretched very wide.

00:31:30.066 --> 00:31:32.086
And that's problematic because
that's not what I wanted.

00:31:32.896 --> 00:31:37.376
But over here, its actual size
is correct; it's just pinned

00:31:37.436 --> 00:31:39.486
to the side which is,
again, not what I wanted,

00:31:39.486 --> 00:31:40.906
but I know it's not
a size problem,

00:31:41.256 --> 00:31:45.286
it's a tied-to-where
sort of problem.

00:31:46.766 --> 00:31:48.306
The other solution is to
look in the view debugger;

00:31:48.386 --> 00:31:50.816
right next to all of your
breakpoint navigation,

00:31:50.816 --> 00:31:52.026
you have this little
button here.

00:31:52.156 --> 00:31:54.706
When you press that, it
pulls up your layout in a way

00:31:54.706 --> 00:31:57.456
that you can click through and
view things like constraints,

00:31:57.846 --> 00:32:00.666
just the wireframes for the
views, you can see stuff in 3D.

00:32:01.006 --> 00:32:02.796
It gives you a really nice
view of all your layers,

00:32:03.246 --> 00:32:06.596
and that can really help with a
lot of view debugging scenarios.

00:32:07.256 --> 00:32:09.316
Finally, we have
another debugger method,

00:32:09.316 --> 00:32:10.806
because I really
like using LLDB,

00:32:11.186 --> 00:32:12.966
called
exerciseAmbiguityInLayout.

00:32:13.196 --> 00:32:16.276
If you have a view that you know
is ambiguous and you run this

00:32:16.276 --> 00:32:19.026
on that view in the
debugger and continue,

00:32:19.026 --> 00:32:21.596
the Layout Engine will show
you the other solution it had,

00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:24.306
which is a great clue when
you are trying to figure

00:32:24.306 --> 00:32:25.726
out where the problem
is coming from.

00:32:26.456 --> 00:32:27.626
And I will show you
how that looks now.

00:32:28.926 --> 00:32:32.156
Okay. So we are back to this
view that we just saw a bit ago,

00:32:32.646 --> 00:32:35.746
and when it's in its regular
layout, Saturn is flying off

00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:39.296
to the side, so I have,
again, my debug gesture

00:32:39.296 --> 00:32:42.066
that I can use just because
I need an easy way to break.

00:32:42.656 --> 00:32:44.806
The first thing I can
do is see what's going

00:32:44.806 --> 00:32:48.836
on with the whole view by
running auto layout trace on it,

00:32:49.766 --> 00:32:52.516
and you see that everything
is okay, except for Saturn,

00:32:52.516 --> 00:32:53.586
which has an ambiguous layout.

00:32:53.586 --> 00:32:55.476
That's where I am going
to concentrate my efforts.

00:32:56.426 --> 00:32:58.546
There's also a Boolean
that will tell you view

00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:01.706
by view whether it has
an ambiguous layout.

00:33:01.926 --> 00:33:04.096
And that's just
hasAmbiguousLayout --

00:33:04.926 --> 00:33:07.316
pretty easy to remember, and
in Saturn's case, it's true.

00:33:08.376 --> 00:33:11.846
And if you have that happening,
you can also exercise ambiguity

00:33:11.846 --> 00:33:14.146
in layout and continue,

00:33:14.946 --> 00:33:18.716
and it will show you the other
solution it had for that issue.

00:33:18.716 --> 00:33:20.546
So let's run that again.

00:33:21.406 --> 00:33:22.656
And -- oops.

00:33:22.966 --> 00:33:24.186
Wrong thing to run again.

00:33:24.726 --> 00:33:30.106
And now it's over
to the side again.

00:33:30.576 --> 00:33:32.486
So in this case, it looks
like the layout guides I put

00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:35.026
on either side of Saturn
aren't working for some reason,

00:33:35.386 --> 00:33:39.126
so I am going to go up
and find my constraints

00:33:39.126 --> 00:33:40.966
that are tying my planets
to their specific areas,

00:33:40.966 --> 00:33:45.016
and they are doing that by
having a ratio of layout guides

00:33:45.016 --> 00:33:47.256
on either side in order
to determine where it is.

00:33:47.336 --> 00:33:49.126
I've got one for
Saturn right here,

00:33:49.836 --> 00:33:51.956
and it should have equal
layout guides on either side,

00:33:51.956 --> 00:33:53.596
which should put it pretty
much exactly in the middle.

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:58.176
The problem appears to be that
I did not actually add this

00:33:58.256 --> 00:34:01.886
to the constraints array I
am activating for that view.

00:34:02.196 --> 00:34:07.026
And so if I add it,
things go much better.

00:34:07.426 --> 00:34:10.045
Saturn stays put exactly
where I wanted it to be.

00:34:10.085 --> 00:34:12.255
And that's really
all that's involved

00:34:12.396 --> 00:34:14.326
in diagnosing ambiguity.

00:34:14.326 --> 00:34:17.565
It's pretty easy
once you start kind

00:34:17.565 --> 00:34:20.985
of working with it a little bit.

00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:22.815
So, debugging your layout.

00:34:23.146 --> 00:34:25.085
The most important thing
is to think carefully

00:34:25.446 --> 00:34:27.025
about the information
that your engine needs.

00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:28.706
This morning we talked a lot

00:34:28.706 --> 00:34:32.166
about giving the Layout
Engine all of its information

00:34:32.166 --> 00:34:34.286
so that it can calculate
your layout properly

00:34:34.286 --> 00:34:35.806
in various adaptive scenarios.

00:34:36.406 --> 00:34:40.806
If you can kind of pull that all
together, you are going to run

00:34:40.806 --> 00:34:43.406
into a lot fewer problems
as opposed to just trying

00:34:43.406 --> 00:34:44.936
to make a couple
of constraints here

00:34:44.936 --> 00:34:46.596
and there and throwing it in.

00:34:47.726 --> 00:34:50.505
But if you do run into
problems, use the logs

00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:52.196
if constraints are
unsatisfiable.

00:34:52.196 --> 00:34:53.886
It gives you a lot of
really good information.

00:34:54.065 --> 00:34:56.846
In order to make good use of
those logs, add identifiers

00:34:57.356 --> 00:34:58.466
for all those constraints
and views.

00:34:58.866 --> 00:35:01.036
You also want to regularly
check for ambiguity.

00:35:01.346 --> 00:35:03.256
You won't necessarily
see it on the first run.

00:35:03.706 --> 00:35:05.916
This is a good thing to put
in something like a unit test

00:35:05.916 --> 00:35:08.106
and just run it on all your
views regularly, so if you run

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:11.116
into ambiguous layout, you can
diagnose it before you see it.

00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:13.646
And then we have several tools

00:35:13.646 --> 00:35:14.786
to help you resolve
these issues.

00:35:15.016 --> 00:35:17.866
Interface builder is helpful,
as always, the view debugger,

00:35:17.946 --> 00:35:20.146
and our various methods in lldb.

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:22.316
All right.

00:35:22.406 --> 00:35:25.186
So we have come a
very long way today.

00:35:26.046 --> 00:35:29.086
If you were with us this
morning, you saw us talking

00:35:29.086 --> 00:35:30.826
about maintainable
layouts with stack views

00:35:31.276 --> 00:35:32.826
and changing constraints
properly,

00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:35.546
working with view sizing and
making self-sizing views,

00:35:35.646 --> 00:35:37.796
and then using priorities
and alignment to make sure

00:35:37.796 --> 00:35:39.606
that your layout stays
exactly the way you want it

00:35:39.686 --> 00:35:41.716
to in various adaptive
environments.

00:35:42.486 --> 00:35:45.976
And then just now, we talked
about the layout cycle in depth,

00:35:46.126 --> 00:35:49.386
interacting with legacy
layout, creating constraints

00:35:49.386 --> 00:35:52.946
with layout anchors rather
than the old methods,

00:35:52.946 --> 00:35:55.376
and constraining negative
space with layout guides.

00:35:56.016 --> 00:35:58.806
And we just now talked about
unsatisfiable constraints

00:35:58.806 --> 00:36:00.966
and resolving ambiguity,
which are two problems

00:36:00.966 --> 00:36:02.796
that people tend to
run into regularly

00:36:02.796 --> 00:36:03.776
when they are using Auto Layout.

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:06.496
So those are all
of our mysteries.

00:36:07.226 --> 00:36:09.166
I hope we laid them all out
for you pretty well here.

00:36:09.906 --> 00:36:13.256
If you haven't seen Part
1, I recommend going back

00:36:13.256 --> 00:36:15.756
and viewing it because there
was a lot of information there

00:36:16.026 --> 00:36:19.016
that can be very useful to
you, and the video should be

00:36:19.016 --> 00:36:20.246
up at some point
in the near future,

00:36:20.506 --> 00:36:22.186
or you can travel
back in time to 11:00.

00:36:22.526 --> 00:36:22.866
Either way.

00:36:23.606 --> 00:36:27.156
So to get more information on
all of this, we, of course,

00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:29.876
have documentation up on
the website, and we do have

00:36:29.876 --> 00:36:32.586
that planets code, which is
more for the first session

00:36:32.586 --> 00:36:33.546
but we also used here.

00:36:33.546 --> 00:36:36.846
The planets code that you
see here is not broken.

00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:38.096
It actually works properly.

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:40.256
You will have to break it if you
want to play around with some

00:36:40.256 --> 00:36:41.576
of the debugging
methods you saw here.

00:36:41.626 --> 00:36:43.906
We have some related sessions.

00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:47.426
So again, Part 1 was earlier
today, and we have a couple

00:36:47.426 --> 00:36:49.186
of sessions tomorrow that
you might be interested in.

00:36:49.186 --> 00:36:51.696
We are also going to head
down to the lab after this,

00:36:52.236 --> 00:36:54.336
and we will be there to
answer questions that you have

00:36:54.336 --> 00:36:55.896
about Auto Layout and
Interface Builder.

00:36:56.836 --> 00:36:58.186
And that's what we've
got for you today.

00:36:58.516 --> 00:36:58.946
Have a good one.

00:36:59.516 --> 00:37:03.500
[Applause]
