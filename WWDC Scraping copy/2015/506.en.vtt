WEBVTT

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:25.486
>> Welcome to session 506.

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:27.446
My name is Tim Monroe,
and I am a member

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:30.576
of the AVFoundation engineering
Team, and I want to talk

00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:33.756
to you today about editing
movies in AVFoundation.

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:36.816
The takeaway message
is very simple.

00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:39.696
AVFoundation provides
new classes

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:41.966
for editing QuickTime
movie files.

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:44.056
Oh, come on.

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:44.936
You can do better than that.

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:45.846
Let's hear some applause.

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.756
[Applause]

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:48.106
Thank you.

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:53.166
Now, I am excited about
this capability because,

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.466
as you'll see in a little
bit, this provides the tools

00:00:56.466 --> 00:01:01.116
that I need to manage a personal
project that I have been working

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.346
on for about the last ten
years, and in some sense,

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:07.786
it brings to a culmination a
project that I have been doing

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:09.776
for about the last 35 years.

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:11.786
So I've got a lot of
skin in this game,

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:14.426
and I hope you'll enjoy
the presentation today.

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:18.416
So what does it mean to say we
can edit QuickTime movie files.

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.426
Well, we can open
QuickTime movie files

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:24.756
and perform range-based
editing on movies and tracks.

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:27.696
So you select a section,
a segment of a movie,

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:30.126
and copy it into
some other movie.

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.366
We can add and remove tracks.

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:35.376
We can set tracks
associations between tracks --

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:38.386
so say to mark one track at
a chapter track of another.

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:43.076
We can add or modify
track and movie metadata.

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:47.136
And we can create movie
files and what I am going

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:49.556
to call URL sample
reference movie files.

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:53.396
So how are we going
to do this today?

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:58.176
First thing I am going to do
is situate these new classes

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:02.766
in respect to the existing
classes we have in AVFoundation.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.986
Then I am going to do sort of
an API crawl where I go through

00:02:05.986 --> 00:02:07.336
and touch on the high points

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:10.196
of the new methods we've
added to these classes.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:12.706
And finally, I am going
to go back and talk

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:14.876
about this personal
project that I've mentioned

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:19.206
and show you very clearly how
these new capabilities allow me

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:21.696
to do interesting things
with this large amount

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:22.856
of data that I've collected.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:28.006
So let's talk about the
AVFoundation editing classes.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:30.476
If you've done any
work with AVFoundation

00:02:30.476 --> 00:02:35.096
in the editing space, you
know that we have two classes

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:38.096
that you work with, the
operative abstraction is

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:41.766
that of a composition, and so
you can have AVCompositions

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:45.346
and at the mutable level,
AVMutableCompositions.

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:47.826
Now, compositions are
really cool stuff.

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:50.176
You can make some really
exciting presentations.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:52.766
There's just one
pesky little drawback

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.926
to AVMutableComposition,

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:58.216
which is there's no
standard file format

00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:01.306
into which you can
serialize your composition.

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:03.436
So it makes it hard

00:03:03.436 --> 00:03:05.946
to interchange your
snazzy composition

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:07.326
with other applications.

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:11.416
Well, when we move to
AVMovie and AVMutableMovie,

00:03:11.446 --> 00:03:14.306
that problem goes away
because this is tied

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:16.956
to the QuickTime
movie file format.

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:20.266
We can now open these, edit
them, and write them back.

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:25.186
At the track level, we
have a similar setup.

00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:28.636
As you know, a composition is
composed of composition tracks,

00:03:28.926 --> 00:03:29.976
and at the mutable level,

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.136
we have AVMutableComposition
tracks.

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:36.466
In El Capitan, we are adding two
new classes at the track level,

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.326
AVMovieTrack and
AVMutableMovieTrack.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:43.576
So we have, really, five
new classes that you have

00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:47.756
to worry about, movie and
mutable movie, movie track

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:48.856
and mutable movie track,

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:52.876
and then this fifth class
called AVMediaDataStorage.

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:56.686
That's a very simple class,
and its whole job in life is

00:03:56.686 --> 00:04:00.836
to indicate where you want new
sample data that you are writing

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:03.286
into a file to end up.

00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:10.636
So an AVMovie represents the
data in an audiovisual file

00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:13.596
that conforms to the
QuickTime movie file format.

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:15.906
Now, if you are familiar
with QuickTime movies,

00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:18.896
you know that there are also a
number of related file formats

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:23.226
that were devised based on the
QuickTime movie file format,

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:26.036
and these are collectively
called ISO base media

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:27.106
file formats.

00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:30.566
And AVMovie and mutable movie
can handle these just as well

00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:32.386
as they can QuickTime
movie files.

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:37.626
Now, what's the key
feature about these files?

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:39.096
From my point of
view, it's this,

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:42.956
that the file format
enforces a strict separation

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:47.746
between sample data and the data
that organizes that sample data

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.176
into tracks and movies.

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:55.966
So here's a basic diagram
of a QuickTime movie file.

00:04:56.386 --> 00:04:58.796
It starts with what's
called a file type box,

00:04:59.136 --> 00:05:02.596
and this is a very simple little
bit of data that indicates

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:04.056
which of the file formats

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:06.416
in this family this
file conforms to.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:09.916
There's also a movie box
which, as I just said,

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:13.566
is the organizing information
about all that sample data,

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:15.566
which is found in its own box.

00:05:16.326 --> 00:05:20.256
Now, the order of most
of this is arbitrary.

00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:22.736
The file type box
has to come first,

00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:25.526
but the other boxes can come
in pretty much any order.

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:28.356
So we could have the movie
box at the end of the file,

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:33.306
it could be situated between
a couple of sample data boxes,

00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:36.426
there can even be parts of
the file that are unused.

00:05:36.456 --> 00:05:39.516
Maybe they used to contain
data, but they don't anymore.

00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:42.546
Now, what's in this movie box?

00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:45.086
Well, there are three types of
information that we are going

00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:46.356
to be concerned with here today.

00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:49.746
First is what I like to
call global settings.

00:05:50.106 --> 00:05:51.976
This is information that without

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.746
which you wouldn't
really have a movie,

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:56.486
things like how many
tracks are in the movie,

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:58.436
what's the duration
of the movie,

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:02.496
when was this file created,
and what's the preferred rate

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:04.866
that you would like
this played back at.

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:09.396
There's also in a movie box
some metadata, which is sort

00:06:09.396 --> 00:06:12.916
of optional data that isn't
strictly speaking necessary

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:16.006
for the playback of the
media, but is useful to have.

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:18.526
And this would be stuff
like a copyright statement,

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:21.866
an indication of who the
author, what the title is,

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:24.746
and maybe even some
custom metadata that you

00:06:24.746 --> 00:06:27.346
or some other app has
written into this movie box.

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:29.766
The last thing that
you will find

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:33.746
in a movie box are track
boxes, and these are pieces

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:36.216
of information that define
the tracks in the movie.

00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:39.336
So they contain the track type,

00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:44.506
they point to the sample data
that's needed for the track.

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:46.826
They also contain
track metadata.

00:06:46.826 --> 00:06:48.806
And again, you can write
custom track metadata

00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:49.686
in there if you'd like.

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:53.216
And there's also information
about track association,

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:56.156
so how this track relates to
other tracks in the movie.

00:06:56.716 --> 00:07:01.606
So the key feature here is that
the sample data location --

00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:04.816
so the sample data itself is
not contained in the track box.

00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:08.406
The track box contains
references

00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:16.086
to the sample data,
sort of like this.

00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:19.666
Now, it's possible for the
sample data that a track refers

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:22.036
to exist in another
file altogether,

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:24.816
so you can have external
sample references.

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:29.606
It's even possible for the
sample references to refer only

00:07:29.606 --> 00:07:30.926
to external sample data.

00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:34.766
Now, when we have this
situation, the little movie box

00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:38.566
and its file type box is called
a sample reference movie file.

00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:42.316
So there's no actual
data in that box;

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.176
it just points to
data elsewhere.

00:07:44.686 --> 00:07:48.906
Now, it turns out that this
is an incredibly powerful tool

00:07:50.096 --> 00:07:52.746
to have available when you
are working with media files.

00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:54.396
Why is that?

00:07:54.396 --> 00:07:58.016
Because I can edit that small
little bit of information

00:07:58.266 --> 00:08:02.186
and never have to touch that
huge amount of media data.

00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:04.706
However, as you can imagine,

00:08:04.706 --> 00:08:08.076
there's a certain
fragility involved here.

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:11.906
Why? Because I'm referring
to data, and if the data

00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:13.776
that I am referring
to happens to move

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:16.306
or gets deleted,
I am out of luck.

00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:18.486
I can't play my presentation
anymore.

00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:20.796
Now, it's possible to reduce

00:08:20.796 --> 00:08:22.556
that fragility in
a couple of ways.

00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:26.096
Primarily by using relative URLs

00:08:26.096 --> 00:08:29.186
when I make these sample
references, and we'll see how

00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:30.416
to do that in a little bit.

00:08:30.806 --> 00:08:34.765
But at the end of the
day, you are going to want

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:36.686
to have what's called
a self-contained movie.

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:39.515
If you want to give it to
a friend to view or post it

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:40.686
for delivery on the Web.

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:42.316
And when you need to do that,

00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:45.046
you can just run
your mutable movie

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:47.046
through an AVAssetExportSession

00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:49.236
to get a nice self-contained
file.

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:53.086
Okay. So let's look at
the movie editing API

00:08:53.086 --> 00:08:54.236
that we are introducing.

00:08:54.836 --> 00:09:00.376
At the immutable level -- so
AVMovie is an immutable subclass

00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:03.956
of AVAsset -- we can actually do
some interesting things already.

00:09:04.186 --> 00:09:06.296
We can inspect the movie.

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:08.206
We can get what's
called the movie header.

00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:10.826
And we can write this movie
header into a new file.

00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:16.286
By movie header, I just
mean the file type box

00:09:16.286 --> 00:09:19.096
and the movie box together,
none of the sample data.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:24.086
So how do we initialize
an AVMovie?

00:09:24.086 --> 00:09:27.816
If you have initialized an
AVRL, you know how to do it.

00:09:27.816 --> 00:09:30.606
You give us a URL, and we
give you back an AVMovie.

00:09:31.046 --> 00:09:35.856
You can also, if you
have a movie header, say,

00:09:35.856 --> 00:09:38.406
on the paste board,
you can access that

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:41.146
and create a movie
from a block of data.

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:44.016
We are not actually going
to talk about this anymore

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.566
in this talk, but if you look

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:48.636
at our sample code package
called AVMovieEditor,

00:09:48.906 --> 00:09:51.786
you will see very nicely
how you can put stuff

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:53.726
and take stuff off
of the paste board.

00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:57.516
So here is how easy it is

00:09:57.516 --> 00:09:59.456
to create a sample
reference movie file.

00:10:00.026 --> 00:10:04.326
We'll open a URL as an AVMovie.

00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:11.806
Sorry. Then we call the right --

00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:14.506
an indication of the type
of file we want to create,

00:10:14.896 --> 00:10:16.076
and then some options.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.326
Now, in this case, the option

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.716
that we've specified
is truncate destination

00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:21.886
to movie header only.

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:26.046
Essentially, this means if
there's any data already

00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:29.126
at that output URL, it's
going to get blown away

00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:30.286
and what's going to end up in

00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:32.116
that file is simply
the movie header.

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:36.056
Now, it's possible to
pass in a different option

00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:39.006
and not blow away any data
that might be in that file,

00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:42.136
so that would be the add movie
header to destination option.

00:10:42.136 --> 00:10:49.596
So let's move to
the mutable subclass

00:10:49.596 --> 00:10:51.536
of AVMovie, AVMutableMovie.

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:55.466
This provides editing
methods that aus

00:10:55.466 --> 00:11:00.236
to perform range-based movie
editing, add and remove tracks,

00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:02.576
add or modify movie metadata.

00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:06.806
So how do we initialize
an AVMutableMovie?

00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:09.166
Pretty much the same way
we initialize an AVMovie.

00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:12.326
We will pass it a URL,
but in this case we need

00:11:12.326 --> 00:11:14.336
to be able toened had ale
any errors that might occur.

00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:18.966
It's also possible to create
an AVMutableMovie from scratch.

00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:22.846
So this line of code gives us
back an empty AVMutableMovie

00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:26.246
that we are going to want to
add tracks to and then some data

00:11:26.246 --> 00:11:27.866
to the tracks and so forth.

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:32.606
These are the segment
editing methods available

00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:33.786
on AVMutableMovie.

00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:36.126
If you have worked with
AVMutable composition,

00:11:36.126 --> 00:11:39.646
this is familiar because
they are, in fact,

00:11:39.646 --> 00:11:45.136
identical with one exception,

00:11:45.136 --> 00:11:48.936
which is the insert time range
method takes an additional

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:53.866
parameter that indicates whether
you want to copy the sample data

00:11:53.866 --> 00:11:56.906
into the target or just
copy sample references.

00:11:57.396 --> 00:12:06.076
Now, if you copy sample data
into the target mutable movie,

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:09.446
you need to tell it where
to write that sample data.

00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:11.266
It does nothing by default.

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:13.626
It's not going to
write it into the file

00:12:13.626 --> 00:12:16.186
that the movie box is
located in, for instance.

00:12:16.586 --> 00:12:18.696
So you have to explicitly
specify

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:21.466
where you want any new
sample data that's written

00:12:21.466 --> 00:12:23.826
into this movie to be put.

00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:27.846
And you do that by specifying
the default media data storage

00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:29.926
property of the mutable movie.

00:12:30.426 --> 00:12:34.676
And this is where this
AVMediaDataStorage class comes

00:12:34.676 --> 00:12:35.246
into play.

00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:40.716
Again, it just simply
wraps a URL at this point.

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:43.796
There are methods for
creating and removing tracks,

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.096
and you see to create a track,

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:47.136
we have to say what
type of track we want.

00:12:47.136 --> 00:12:48.106
Do we want a video track,

00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:50.106
do we want an audio
track, and so forth.

00:12:50.956 --> 00:12:53.666
And if we like, if we have an
existing track that we want

00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:57.106
to model this new one on,
we can pass it in as an --

00:12:57.286 --> 00:13:00.276
as a parameter and say take
the relevant properties

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:02.176
from that existing
track and use those.

00:13:02.176 --> 00:13:07.576
So here's a simple
little case study.

00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:11.026
To update an existing movie
file, we could open it

00:13:11.026 --> 00:13:14.576
up from a URL, do some edits
using the methods we've just

00:13:14.576 --> 00:13:18.946
seen, and then we can use the
right movie header to URL method

00:13:19.296 --> 00:13:22.176
to write the movie header
back into that same file.

00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:24.526
This is what's known
as in-place editing.

00:13:25.026 --> 00:13:27.536
So here we haven't
moved any sample data.

00:13:28.196 --> 00:13:30.856
All we've done is
tweak the movie box

00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:32.636
and put it back into
the same file.

00:13:32.636 --> 00:13:37.056
So let's talk about
the track editing API.

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.836
This allows us to
modify tracks that are

00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:41.166
in a QuickTime movie file,

00:13:41.616 --> 00:13:44.616
and we have range-based
track editing,

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.316
just like we saw
at the movie level.

00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:50.866
We can also set associations
between tracks, and we can add

00:13:50.866 --> 00:13:52.296
or modify track metadata.

00:13:52.876 --> 00:13:55.896
So here are the segment
editing methods,

00:13:55.896 --> 00:14:00.576
and they should look familiar
because we've just seen them.

00:14:00.786 --> 00:14:01.906
At the movie level.

00:14:01.906 --> 00:14:05.416
The only difference being that
instead of insert time range

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:09.186
of asset, we have insert
time range of track.

00:14:09.856 --> 00:14:12.986
And again, when we do insert
time range, we have to specify,

00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:15.586
do you want to copy the sample
data, or do you just want

00:14:15.586 --> 00:14:17.006
to put in sample references.

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:20.206
And if you copy the sample
data, the track has to know

00:14:20.206 --> 00:14:21.936
where that sample
data is going to go,

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:25.716
and we do that by setting the
media data storage property

00:14:26.046 --> 00:14:29.486
of that track using exactly
the same class we used

00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:30.296
at the movie level.

00:14:30.866 --> 00:14:33.756
So here is another case study.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.586
Suppose there's a
little bit of a clip

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:36.906
that I want to silence out.

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:40.376
Maybe there's some unfortunate
language in that clip.

00:14:40.486 --> 00:14:44.986
I could do it it quite simply
by finding the first audio track

00:14:44.986 --> 00:14:49.486
in the movie; define a time
range, which is the range I want

00:14:49.486 --> 00:14:52.966
to silence; remove
that time range;

00:14:53.246 --> 00:14:56.206
and then insert an empty
time range at that same spot.

00:14:56.756 --> 00:15:00.066
The net effect of this code
is to have an empty segment

00:15:00.406 --> 00:15:05.096
where there used to be some
offensive language, say.

00:15:05.336 --> 00:15:07.436
Working with track
associations is very simple.

00:15:07.436 --> 00:15:11.366
You can add a track association
or remove a track association.

00:15:11.366 --> 00:15:14.236
We will see this in use later.

00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:19.756
And I said I would tell you
how to use relative URLs

00:15:19.756 --> 00:15:22.966
when you copy sample
data into your track,

00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:24.646
and you do it like this.

00:15:24.936 --> 00:15:29.046
You open. For each track,

00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:34.726
we will set sample
reference base URL property

00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:39.026
to some common parent of the
movie that contains the movie --

00:15:39.026 --> 00:15:41.696
file that contains the
movie box and the files

00:15:41.696 --> 00:15:43.736
that contain all the media data.

00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:46.576
All right.

00:15:46.576 --> 00:15:51.286
So let's move on to
this personal project

00:15:51.286 --> 00:15:53.836
that I talk about, and I
want to call it A Study

00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:58.496
in Scarlet (and Gray)
apologies to Conan Doyle.

00:15:58.496 --> 00:16:01.756
Let's jump back in time to 1980.

00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:02.406
What are we talking?

00:16:02.406 --> 00:16:03.646
35 years ago.

00:16:04.336 --> 00:16:07.006
At that time, I was a
graduate student across the bay

00:16:07.006 --> 00:16:10.796
at Berkeley, and I needed a
way to blow off some energy,

00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:14.876
so I went out and bought a pair
of skates, and I discovered

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:17.046
that Berkeley is a great
place to be a skater

00:16:17.046 --> 00:16:19.396
because it's got these
really nice hills.

00:16:20.826 --> 00:16:22.816
And I really enjoyed that.

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:27.036
So I kept finding higher
and higher hills to climb up

00:16:27.036 --> 00:16:28.526
and then go flying down.

00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:31.956
So here in 1984, you
can see me at the top

00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:33.996
of Claremont avenue in Oakland.

00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:38.946
In the distance, you can see
San Francisco, just this side

00:16:38.946 --> 00:16:42.606
of the bay, we have Emeryville,
and we have this wonderful,

00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:44.776
almost looks like a
ski run in front of me.

00:16:44.996 --> 00:16:48.476
I am not quite sure what
the hand up is doing.

00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:50.256
Maybe it's the sort
of we who are

00:16:50.256 --> 00:16:54.026
about to die salute you
thing, and I didn't die.

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:54.646
It's okay.

00:16:56.726 --> 00:16:58.926
[Laughter] Well, what I
did in order to keep track

00:16:58.926 --> 00:17:01.116
of where I was, I went out
and I bought a street map,

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:03.826
and I got myself a
yellow highlighter,

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:07.915
and I started marking off on my
map exactly where I had been,

00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:10.586
which hills were
particularly good.

00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:14.185
Well, if you are like me,
that's a really bad thing

00:17:14.185 --> 00:17:16.366
to start doing because
you're going to want to end

00:17:16.366 --> 00:17:18.526
up coloring in the entire map.

00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:22.786
And so about 2000 -- sorry.

00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:27.046
About 1985, I came
up with a project

00:17:27.086 --> 00:17:29.976
that I called Tim's Radical
Inline Skate Tour of Oakland,

00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:34.866
or TRISTO, and the
goal was really simple,

00:17:34.866 --> 00:17:36.776
to skate every street
in Oakland,

00:17:36.776 --> 00:17:38.496
the entire length of it.

00:17:38.806 --> 00:17:42.866
This continued from
1985 until about 2005,

00:17:42.866 --> 00:17:44.566
so ten years ago, and I made it.

00:17:45.556 --> 00:17:45.946
Okay?

00:17:46.016 --> 00:17:47.876
[Applause]

00:17:47.876 --> 00:17:48.226
Thank you.

00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:54.006
Oakland has about 800 miles of
roadways that you would have

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.876
to skate in order
to accomplish this.

00:17:57.026 --> 00:18:01.256
Now, when I was done in
2005, I had no location data.

00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:03.286
GPS hadn't been invented
when I started,

00:18:03.636 --> 00:18:05.256
and it certainly
wasn't available.

00:18:05.676 --> 00:18:08.846
Actually, I did have location
data because if you open

00:18:08.846 --> 00:18:16.026
up my map, you will see that
it is right side up all yellow,

00:18:16.116 --> 00:18:18.876
not just -- but Alameda,
Piedmont,

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:21.246
Emeryville, the whole
nine yards.

00:18:23.226 --> 00:18:26.886
I also had no video.

00:18:26.916 --> 00:18:29.576
If you remember back
to that time, I mean,

00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.606
the camera you would be
carrying in 1985 would be clunky

00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:34.356
and fragile, and you just
wouldn't want to have it

00:18:34.356 --> 00:18:35.626
with you when you are
out there skating.

00:18:36.226 --> 00:18:39.256
So when I finished
this, I really --

00:18:39.336 --> 00:18:41.376
this is a wacko project,
I admit that,

00:18:42.106 --> 00:18:45.696
and I made absolutely no effort
to tell anybody about this.

00:18:46.186 --> 00:18:51.576
Unfortunately, the San Francisco
chronicle learned of this feat,

00:18:51.576 --> 00:18:54.096
I guess, and wrote a nice
little newspaper article,

00:18:54.096 --> 00:18:55.446
one of these human
interest stories.

00:18:56.996 --> 00:18:59.346
The Oakland City
Council learned about it,

00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:02.466
they passed a resolution
praising the extraordinary

00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:05.856
physical accomplishment --
that's their words, not mine.

00:19:06.796 --> 00:19:10.476
A couple of filmmakers
in Oakland heard about it

00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:12.496
and spent literally years off

00:19:12.496 --> 00:19:15.346
and on making a nice little
documentary about this project,

00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:19.616
which came out about a year ago
and has been making the rounds

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:21.356
of independent theaters
in the Bay area.

00:19:21.356 --> 00:19:25.666
Just completely wacko.

00:19:26.176 --> 00:19:30.826
So about a couple of years
after I finished this project,

00:19:31.316 --> 00:19:35.206
I started spending some time on
the east coast, in particular

00:19:35.206 --> 00:19:37.486
in the area of Boston,
Massachusetts,

00:19:38.016 --> 00:19:40.666
and even more particular,
in Cambridge.

00:19:40.936 --> 00:19:44.016
And I thought, all right, let's
take this thing on the road.

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:48.386
I spent a few years skating
Cambridge and Somerville,

00:19:48.696 --> 00:19:51.846
and then finally the idea
for TRISTO Boston was born.

00:19:52.466 --> 00:19:53.336
Same idea.

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:56.546
Skate every street in
the city of Boston.

00:19:57.616 --> 00:20:00.976
So this began about 2011.

00:20:01.606 --> 00:20:03.256
I looked at a map, and I
figured it would take me

00:20:03.256 --> 00:20:05.236
about five years
to complete this.

00:20:06.176 --> 00:20:08.436
Well, we had a couple
mild winters in there.

00:20:08.716 --> 00:20:10.196
It's about the same
size as Oakland.

00:20:10.956 --> 00:20:14.226
And I was able to complete this
in about two and a half years,

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:19.206
so in May 2013, I
finished TRISTO Boston.

00:20:19.296 --> 00:20:24.436
Now, this time I was prepared
because as I was skating,

00:20:24.786 --> 00:20:27.366
I had one of those sports
action cameras up on the top

00:20:27.366 --> 00:20:32.046
of my helmet, and I had
a GPS app for my iPhone.

00:20:32.676 --> 00:20:33.766
And so when I ended up,

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:40.586
I had 490 MPEG-4 files
straight off the camera covering

00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:43.216
about 200 different
skates for a total

00:20:43.216 --> 00:20:46.416
of about a terabyte
and a half of data.

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:51.026
I also had GPS data in
the form of GPX files --

00:20:51.026 --> 00:20:53.456
that's sort of an XML
version of location data --

00:20:53.456 --> 00:20:54.376
we will see one later --

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:57.876
for about 150 megabytes
worth of data.

00:20:58.486 --> 00:21:03.176
So just to get an idea of
what these movies look like,

00:21:03.176 --> 00:21:04.416
let's just look at one.

00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:08.496
So these are movies
straight off the camera.

00:21:08.496 --> 00:21:09.946
The only thing I have
done is rename them

00:21:09.946 --> 00:21:10.936
so that it's got the date

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.836
and title making it
easy for me to find.

00:21:15.306 --> 00:21:17.396
So we will open these
up in QuickTime Player.

00:21:17.646 --> 00:21:20.476
There's the second one, so
that continues at the end

00:21:20.476 --> 00:21:24.186
of the first one, so we will
select the first movie here.

00:21:24.646 --> 00:21:26.626
We can see it's a
bright, sunny day.

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:28.956
It's late November.

00:21:29.296 --> 00:21:30.466
It's a weekday.

00:21:31.126 --> 00:21:32.246
And let's just roll this.

00:21:32.246 --> 00:21:35.136
We see it's the fall because
there's leaves on the ground.

00:21:35.746 --> 00:21:37.416
If we had the audio,
we would hear

00:21:37.416 --> 00:21:39.806
that it's actually
quite windy on this day.

00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:42.976
And there's something
strange here, though.

00:21:43.186 --> 00:21:44.706
There's nobody on the street.

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:46.276
There's no pedestrians.

00:21:46.746 --> 00:21:48.226
Let's jump ahead a
little bit again.

00:21:49.096 --> 00:21:50.456
No pedestrians.

00:21:50.456 --> 00:21:51.356
There's some cars.

00:21:51.876 --> 00:21:53.826
Here I am at Longwood
Medical District.

00:21:53.926 --> 00:21:56.226
This is a heavily
trafficked area.

00:21:56.366 --> 00:21:56.996
Nobody there.

00:21:57.246 --> 00:21:58.756
Here's a commercial district.

00:21:59.616 --> 00:22:01.136
Nobody. It's like a ghost town.

00:22:01.316 --> 00:22:02.486
So what's going on?

00:22:03.436 --> 00:22:06.376
Well, we'll solve
that problem later.

00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:10.646
So what I've got,
basically, is a hay stack

00:22:11.066 --> 00:22:12.236
and a bunch of needles.

00:22:12.236 --> 00:22:14.456
I've got 500 hours of video.

00:22:15.036 --> 00:22:19.886
Even if 99% of it is junk,
that's still five full hours

00:22:19.886 --> 00:22:21.836
of interesting video
that I'd like to find.

00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:24.316
Part of the problem, though,

00:22:24.316 --> 00:22:26.016
is I don't even know
what the needles look

00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:28.326
like because I don't
know what's important

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:30.746
in these 500 hours of video.

00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:35.756
Well, I do know some things
that I'd really love to look at,

00:22:35.756 --> 00:22:38.506
and here is sort of a
montage of some of these.

00:22:48.256 --> 00:22:49.266
Snow, really?

00:22:49.306 --> 00:22:49.976
I mean, come on.

00:22:55.116 --> 00:22:56.496
Like, I didn't see that pothole?

00:22:57.516 --> 00:23:04.576
[Laughter]

00:23:05.076 --> 00:23:07.886
Now, that one's my favorite,
because as you can see,

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:11.496
I go down, I kind of roll over,
I get back and keep on skating.

00:23:11.496 --> 00:23:13.976
You know, if it wasn't
as -- thank you.

00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:18.276
[Applause]

00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:20.916
Now, I actually had to
pay somebody to weed --

00:23:20.916 --> 00:23:25.256
to look through about
1/50 of all of my video

00:23:26.186 --> 00:23:27.646
to get these six clips.

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:30.626
So in theory, there's 300

00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:33.666
of these wonderful falls
somewhere in that hay stack.

00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:36.756
So at about, you know,
five seconds per fall,

00:23:36.756 --> 00:23:39.416
we are talking 25
minutes of this stuff,

00:23:39.416 --> 00:23:40.976
which would be really
fun to watch.

00:23:41.061 --> 00:23:43.061
[Laughter]

00:23:43.106 --> 00:23:45.456
So here's what I want to
do with all this data.

00:23:45.686 --> 00:23:48.396
I've got a terabyte and a
half of video data that I want

00:23:48.396 --> 00:23:49.616
to somehow do something with.

00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:51.086
I want to find those needles.

00:23:51.466 --> 00:23:55.886
So the first step is going to
be to combine the various files

00:23:55.886 --> 00:23:57.976
that came off the
camera for one skate

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:02.306
into a sample reference movie
file so that I can just open it

00:24:02.306 --> 00:24:05.246
and edit it and not have to
worry about the camera files.

00:24:06.436 --> 00:24:09.276
The second thing I want to
do is add indexing metadata

00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:12.396
as movie metadata.

00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:15.466
So I want to go in and
mark in the file, okay,

00:24:15.466 --> 00:24:18.386
this is where I start to fall,
and this is the end of the fall.

00:24:18.736 --> 00:24:20.756
Or this is where
dogs are chasing me,

00:24:20.756 --> 00:24:22.236
and this is where
they finally figured

00:24:22.236 --> 00:24:24.206
out they are not
going to get me.

00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:27.096
Or this is where I am talking
to a law enforcement officer,

00:24:27.096 --> 00:24:28.316
and that just keeps going.

00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:32.786
So I'd like to index all
this stuff so that it's easy

00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:36.006
to search and find all these
needles, as I call them.

00:24:36.006 --> 00:24:38.546
I want to add GPS data.

00:24:38.546 --> 00:24:41.306
I have all that location data
I haven't done anything with.

00:24:41.306 --> 00:24:43.176
I want to add it to the
file, and I am going to do

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:45.376
that as what's called
a timed metadata track.

00:24:46.836 --> 00:24:50.926
And the key is I want to do all
of this without modifying any

00:24:50.926 --> 00:24:52.446
of the original camera files,

00:24:52.886 --> 00:24:57.716
and by minimizing any data
copying that I need to do.

00:24:57.716 --> 00:24:58.946
Okay. How are we
going to do that?

00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:03.016
Well, AVMovie and AVMutableMovie
give us the answer.

00:25:03.926 --> 00:25:07.036
The solution to the first
issue is very simple.

00:25:07.036 --> 00:25:09.746
I am going to take those
camera files, and I am going

00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:12.746
to create a sample reference
movie file that points

00:25:12.786 --> 00:25:14.756
to the data in those
two original files.

00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:17.926
Very straightforward,
standard use

00:25:17.926 --> 00:25:19.776
of sample reference movie files.

00:25:21.096 --> 00:25:24.516
The solution for the second
step is just to add a little bit

00:25:24.516 --> 00:25:27.696
of extra custom metadata
to my movie box.

00:25:28.206 --> 00:25:33.196
The third step is to add
some actual media data

00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:37.656
into my new sample
reference movie file.

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:41.036
And that media data, even though
it's called timed metadata,

00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:44.496
it's stored as media data or
sample data, and it just goes

00:25:44.496 --> 00:25:46.116
into a new track in the file.

00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:50.686
So that's the way I want
to approach this issue.

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:53.336
So the first step is
actually quite simple.

00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:58.036
We'll open the first
movie as a mutable movie,

00:25:58.356 --> 00:25:59.536
and we'll open the second

00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:02.646
and any subsequent
movies as just URL assets.

00:26:03.666 --> 00:26:07.516
We'll define the range in the
asset that we want to insert,

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:10.126
and that's just the
entire asset duration.

00:26:10.826 --> 00:26:15.636
We will actually insert it into
the mutable movie at the end

00:26:15.636 --> 00:26:18.966
of the mutable movie, and
notice we say don't copy the

00:26:18.966 --> 00:26:19.656
sample data.

00:26:19.776 --> 00:26:21.826
I just want to end up
with sample references.

00:26:22.656 --> 00:26:26.656
Finally, all we have to do
is write a new movie header

00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:32.026
out to a new file, and we have
then created a sample reference

00:26:32.026 --> 00:26:34.016
movie file that points
to the data

00:26:34.016 --> 00:26:35.706
in the two original
camera files.

00:26:37.476 --> 00:26:39.046
So let's look at some demos

00:26:39.436 --> 00:26:41.436
of how I solve the
second and third one.

00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:45.096
Normally this slide would just
read demos, but I am a sucker

00:26:45.096 --> 00:26:52.616
for a good palindrome, and
I just couldn't waste it.

00:26:52.616 --> 00:26:55.276
Alvin is a sort of acronym

00:26:55.276 --> 00:26:58.276
for AVFoundation-based
linear indexer.

00:26:59.346 --> 00:27:03.836
Its job is to do the
indexing I talked about,

00:27:04.126 --> 00:27:07.536
but also get the location
data into my file.

00:27:08.246 --> 00:27:09.976
This is what the UI looks like.

00:27:10.466 --> 00:27:14.116
I've got a movie view on the
left, I've got a map view

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:18.136
on the right, and down below you
can see I've got some display

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:20.566
areas where I am going to
be displaying information

00:27:20.566 --> 00:27:22.846
that I glean about this skate.

00:27:23.796 --> 00:27:27.126
So let's go ahead and
open up a movie file.

00:27:27.126 --> 00:27:31.256
And this is the sample reference
movie file that I just created.

00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:32.876
That opens up there.

00:27:32.876 --> 00:27:34.566
I am going to load a GPX file.

00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:38.486
I will go out and select
the appropriate GPS file.

00:27:40.356 --> 00:27:42.146
Now, when I open this file,

00:27:42.466 --> 00:27:44.046
some of the data's
going to be filled in.

00:27:44.046 --> 00:27:46.136
It's going to figure
out how long this was.

00:27:46.826 --> 00:27:50.706
Okay? So let's -- I've got it
so I can expand my map view

00:27:50.706 --> 00:27:51.996
to make it clear where we are.

00:27:51.996 --> 00:27:54.646
So I went out and made a big
circuit around Brookline.

00:27:55.486 --> 00:27:56.476
This situates you.

00:27:56.476 --> 00:27:57.726
There is Logan Airport.

00:27:58.466 --> 00:27:59.876
Here is Boston proper.

00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:01.936
There's Cambridge.

00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:04.706
Now let's just zoom back in.

00:28:05.046 --> 00:28:09.116
Oh, I said I was going
to show you a GPX file.

00:28:09.736 --> 00:28:11.426
So this is what a
GPX file looks like.

00:28:11.426 --> 00:28:14.636
It's just XML formatted,
longitudes, latitudes,

00:28:14.636 --> 00:28:16.286
elevations, time stamps.

00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:21.486
That's it, nothing
more in there.

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:24.206
So let's go here and
run a Web service.

00:28:24.206 --> 00:28:25.306
I am going to go out and find

00:28:25.306 --> 00:28:27.826
out from a government Web
server what the weather was

00:28:27.826 --> 00:28:30.276
like on this day, and I
discover it was quite windy,

00:28:30.276 --> 00:28:33.966
it was 17 mile an hour average,
or for those who speak metric,

00:28:33.966 --> 00:28:38.016
28.4, and it was 39
degrees Fahrenheit or,

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:40.556
interesting factoid,
3.9 centigrade.

00:28:41.516 --> 00:28:44.666
Thanksgiving day, that's why
there's nobody on the street.

00:28:44.666 --> 00:28:46.456
You see, it figured out
this this was a holiday.

00:28:46.456 --> 00:28:48.026
It's also the second
night of Hanukkah.

00:28:49.086 --> 00:28:52.626
Okay? So just these Web
Services have allowed me

00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:54.656
to deduce why there's
nobody on the street.

00:28:54.926 --> 00:28:58.286
Now I am running another
Web Service called reverse

00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:01.936
geocoding, where I am sending
each longitude and latitude

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:05.026
out to a server at
Apple, and it's going

00:29:05.026 --> 00:29:08.426
to hand me back a
state, city, street,

00:29:08.666 --> 00:29:10.336
and sometimes even
a street number.

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:12.486
Basically, it's going
to give me information

00:29:12.486 --> 00:29:14.146
about the streets that I was on.

00:29:14.766 --> 00:29:17.396
So we will wait here while all
these street pins fall down.

00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:21.946
Then we can select one of them
to find out what street that is,

00:29:21.946 --> 00:29:24.076
so that's Commonwealth Avenue.

00:29:25.256 --> 00:29:27.936
Or here's Washington
Street in Brookline.

00:29:28.526 --> 00:29:32.466
Now, I added a search bar
so I could type in, say,

00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:35.876
Commonwealth Avenue, and it will
highlight it when it finds it.

00:29:36.466 --> 00:29:38.496
So if I put this
data into my file,

00:29:38.496 --> 00:29:42.066
now I have complete
searchability on street names.

00:29:42.066 --> 00:29:45.126
I can go in and find all
those little clips where I am

00:29:45.486 --> 00:29:46.646
on a particular street.

00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:51.186
So let's hide those, and
the last thing we need

00:29:51.186 --> 00:29:54.406
to do is synchronize our
video with our location data,

00:29:55.046 --> 00:29:57.256
and I tried various
automatic ways to do this,

00:29:57.286 --> 00:30:00.846
but I discovered the only really
good way to do it was to go

00:30:00.846 --> 00:30:05.186
to a frame in the video where
I knew where I was on the map,

00:30:05.226 --> 00:30:09.616
and then I am going to come
over onto the map and click it

00:30:09.616 --> 00:30:13.566
and say synchronize the video
to this location right here.

00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:15.956
Now, when I do this,
if I come back

00:30:15.956 --> 00:30:17.376
and start playing the video,

00:30:17.376 --> 00:30:20.726
you will see the pin moves
along with the video.

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:22.446
See, these are now synchronized.

00:30:23.666 --> 00:30:25.196
And I can even go
the other direction.

00:30:25.196 --> 00:30:28.016
I can go to someplace on
the map, and I can click it

00:30:28.016 --> 00:30:31.316
and say make the movie
go there, and now I am

00:30:31.316 --> 00:30:32.546
on Commonwealth Avenue,

00:30:32.896 --> 00:30:35.896
and I know this is a
particularly fun downhill slope,

00:30:35.896 --> 00:30:37.776
and we will just let
this ride for a second.

00:30:38.286 --> 00:30:40.616
And this is really why we do
this, right, for these kind

00:30:40.616 --> 00:30:45.536
of downhill with no cars and
what could possibly go wrong?

00:30:46.516 --> 00:30:48.706
[Laughter]

00:30:49.206 --> 00:30:50.356
Okay. So that's Alvin.

00:30:50.356 --> 00:30:52.266
You can see that Alvin
has solved the second

00:30:52.266 --> 00:30:53.496
and third problems for me.

00:30:54.256 --> 00:30:59.926
It's added custom metadata to
my sample reference movie file.

00:31:00.386 --> 00:31:02.206
And it basically
does it like this.

00:31:02.606 --> 00:31:05.776
It gets the existing
metadata by calling the --

00:31:06.146 --> 00:31:07.666
looking at the metadata
property.

00:31:08.376 --> 00:31:10.186
We'll create a new
metadata item,

00:31:10.546 --> 00:31:12.706
we'll fill in its
properties accordingly.

00:31:12.896 --> 00:31:16.136
For instance, the average wind
speed value is the value I got

00:31:16.136 --> 00:31:18.786
from the government server
telling me what the weather was

00:31:18.786 --> 00:31:19.356
on that day.

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:23.046
And I just create some
identifier here that I can look

00:31:23.046 --> 00:31:26.726
for later, and once I've
written this into the file

00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:30.766
with the right movie header to
URL, my movie is all updated.

00:31:31.346 --> 00:31:33.686
Now let's look at step three,

00:31:33.826 --> 00:31:37.096
which is to add the location
data as a time metadata track.

00:31:37.836 --> 00:31:39.686
You already know how to do this.

00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:41.236
If you were here last year

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:45.216
and heard the talk Harnessing
Metadata in Audiovisual Media,

00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:47.476
they showed a couple things.

00:31:47.556 --> 00:31:51.896
First how to get location
data from a capture session,

00:31:52.546 --> 00:31:56.046
and how to right-time
metadata into a movie.

00:31:56.726 --> 00:31:58.966
Well, we've got our
location data.

00:31:58.966 --> 00:32:00.646
It's in our GPX file.

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:03.316
So we don't need that
capture session stuff.

00:32:03.736 --> 00:32:06.256
We can just focus on
taking the source code

00:32:06.256 --> 00:32:08.716
in that second sample
code package

00:32:09.046 --> 00:32:10.446
and putting it into Alvin.

00:32:11.236 --> 00:32:13.976
Now, once we've done
that, what we end up with

00:32:14.176 --> 00:32:18.036
on disk is a timed file that has
a single metadata track in it,

00:32:18.526 --> 00:32:22.666
and all we have to do is copy
that track into a new track

00:32:23.246 --> 00:32:27.926
in our movie, and we will do
it by opening the GPS asset.

00:32:29.276 --> 00:32:31.206
We'll then add a new track

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:35.736
to our movie using whatever
media type happens to be

00:32:35.736 --> 00:32:39.636
in that track, and we will copy
the settings from that track.

00:32:40.956 --> 00:32:45.956
Finally, we insert that range
into this new track, and again,

00:32:45.956 --> 00:32:49.336
if we write this header
into our file, we are done.

00:32:49.966 --> 00:32:55.876
Now, the last thing we need
to do -- this is optional --

00:32:56.226 --> 00:32:59.886
is create a track association
between the timed media track

00:33:00.386 --> 00:33:03.716
and whatever track it is
metadata for, and in this case,

00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:05.116
we have chosen the video track.

00:33:06.206 --> 00:33:10.086
If you leave this step out, the
timed video track is assumed

00:33:10.086 --> 00:33:13.596
to apply to the file as
a whole, and we are fine

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:20.826
as far as that's concerned.

00:33:20.826 --> 00:33:23.206
If you are working
with AVMutableMovie,

00:33:23.366 --> 00:33:24.866
there are a couple of
things to keep in mind.

00:33:25.746 --> 00:33:30.676
As you know, an AVMovie or an
AVMutableMovie is an AVAsset

00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:31.786
because it's a subclass.

00:33:32.306 --> 00:33:33.476
So anything that you can do

00:33:33.476 --> 00:33:36.246
with an AVAsset you can
do with a mutable movie.

00:33:36.706 --> 00:33:39.946
For instance, you could
play it using AVPlayerItem,

00:33:40.766 --> 00:33:44.216
you could grab an image from it
using an AVAssetImageGenerator.

00:33:44.336 --> 00:33:47.936
You could export it using
an AVAssetExportSession.

00:33:48.376 --> 00:33:53.616
Now, if you do any of these
operations on a mutable movie,

00:33:54.146 --> 00:33:56.236
we highly recommend
that you make a copy

00:33:56.236 --> 00:34:00.366
of that mutable movie because if
you're changing the movie while

00:34:00.366 --> 00:34:02.776
you are exporting it,
bad things will happen.

00:34:02.886 --> 00:34:05.036
So just make a copy
of it, do your export,

00:34:05.036 --> 00:34:06.226
and everything works fine.

00:34:06.776 --> 00:34:13.226
The second best practice is
that if you are opening an asset

00:34:13.315 --> 00:34:16.806
that you want to insert
into an AVMutableMovie,

00:34:17.815 --> 00:34:22.396
you should set this flag, AV URL
asset prefer precise duration

00:34:22.396 --> 00:34:24.606
and timing key, to true.

00:34:25.045 --> 00:34:27.156
Now, we haven't done this
in any of the code snippets

00:34:27.156 --> 00:34:31.525
that you've seen so far because
when you open a QuickTime movie,

00:34:31.726 --> 00:34:33.246
this flag is already
set to true.

00:34:33.636 --> 00:34:36.166
But if you were to open
an MP3 file, for instance,

00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:38.485
and wanted to insert that
into a mutable movie,

00:34:38.775 --> 00:34:41.775
you would want to set this flag.

00:34:41.775 --> 00:34:42.686
So let's summarize.

00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:46.436
We've added new classes
to support editing

00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:48.726
on QuickTime movie files.

00:34:50.065 --> 00:34:51.806
This gives us, as
I hope you've seen,

00:34:52.556 --> 00:34:55.085
a really nice, simplified
workflow.

00:34:55.085 --> 00:34:58.176
We are able to work on
reference movies and not

00:34:58.176 --> 00:34:59.846
on the original movies
themselves.

00:35:00.116 --> 00:35:01.666
So if you are handling
large amounts

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.786
of data, this is for you.

00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:07.616
If you want to see how
this works in practice,

00:35:07.616 --> 00:35:11.206
download AVMovieEditor
and take a look at that.

00:35:11.396 --> 00:35:13.686
For more information, go
to the standard places.

00:35:14.246 --> 00:35:17.106
And if you have questions
about this, we'll be in the lab

00:35:17.106 --> 00:35:18.296
on Thursday and Friday.

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:20.486
If you want to look at the --

00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:23.986
how to work with
compositions, jump back to 2010.

00:35:24.656 --> 00:35:27.236
And finally, if you want
to see in great detail how

00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:29.976
to do the timed metadata
track generation,

00:35:30.526 --> 00:35:31.676
go to last year's session,

00:35:31.676 --> 00:35:33.566
Harnessing Metadata
in Audiovisual media.

00:35:34.426 --> 00:35:34.976
Thank you very much.

00:35:35.516 --> 00:35:40.500
