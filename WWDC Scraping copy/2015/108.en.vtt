00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:10.806
>> NEIL DESAI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:34.966
Welcome to Building Watch Apps.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.006
My name is Neil Desai,
and I am an engineer

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:38.916
on the watchOS program.

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:40.976
Today I am going to show you how

00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:43.356
to build a watchOS app
from the ground up.

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:48.266
So we're going to talk through
the architecture of a Watch app,

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.626
we are going to walk
through the app life cycle,

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.666
the layout model.

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.876
We are going to use those
different interface elements

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:57.876
to provide a great
experience for your user.

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.046
We're going to debug the
app, and we are also going

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:04.896
to enhance our app using
various watchOS 2 features.

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:08.956
So, on the Apple Watch you
have four opportunities

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:10.156
to present information.

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:12.326
From the Home screen
on Apple Watch

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:14.146
to where it can manually
launch your Watch app.

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:17.686
The Watch app offers an
in-depth user experience

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:20.096
and where you will focus most
of your development efforts.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.086
You can optionally
provide a Glance,

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:26.876
which offers the most timely
and relevant data from your app

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:28.256
in an abbreviated form.

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:33.246
You can also provide a custom
UI for your app's remote

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:34.436
and local notifications.

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:36.296
Apple Watch takes advantage

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:39.236
of the existing interactive
notification support on iOS

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:42.936
to allow the wearer to
respond with a specific action,

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.906
transition to a specific
area of your app,

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.526
or later view the notification

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:49.626
in Notification Center
on Apple Watch.

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:55.006
And lastly, you can add --
now you can add a Complication

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.826
to display information on the
clock face, and this is one

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.056
that I am really excited about.

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:01.406
This is great for small
pieces of information

00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:06.036
that the user may want to
know while viewing the time.

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:08.996
So now that we know the
different ways the user will

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.166
interact with your app,

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:14.126
let's discuss the
architecture of a Watch app.

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:17.316
Your existing iPhone app
contains your WatchKit extension

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:18.156
and Watch app.

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:21.666
These both get installed on
the Watch after initial pairing

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:25.946
at the user's request or a later
user-initiated installation via

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:26.856
the Apple Watch app.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:30.956
The Watch app is comprised
of two pieces, first,

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:33.966
the WatchKit extension,
and this extension now runs

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.856
on Apple Watch and executes code

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:38.006
in response to user
interactions.

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:40.576
The second piece
is the Watch app.

00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:42.316
Your Watch app's UI is loaded

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:44.226
from a bundle containing
your storyboard

00:02:44.516 --> 00:02:46.906
and static resources
such as images.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:51.216
So this UI, which
lives in the Watch app,

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:53.496
then talks to your
WatchKit extension,

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:55.466
where you can place
all of your logic.

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:58.086
Now that the extension
lives on the Watch,

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.566
you can enable all sorts
of new capabilities,

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:01.736
which I will get into later.

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:05.716
And in the moments when your
Watch app needs to communicate

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:08.396
with your iOS app, there's
a new framework called

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:12.036
WatchConnectivity that you can
use to offload heavy processing

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:15.476
or networking tasks, and
WatchConnectivity lives

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:20.166
on both iOS and watchOS 2 so you
can communicate back and forth.

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:25.316
To summarize, your
storyboard and all

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:28.106
of your static resources are
stored in the Watch app bundle.

00:03:28.986 --> 00:03:30.516
The Watch app target
provided to you

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:33.706
by Xcode already contains
the storyboard you'll use

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:34.486
during development.

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:38.026
Because these resources
are part of the Watch app,

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:40.496
they must all be
specified at design time

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:42.846
and can only be modified
slightly at runtime.

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:45.796
This means you need
to incorporate all

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:47.626
of the UI elements
that you might need

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.266
into each scene of
your storyboard.

00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:53.876
At runtime, coding your WatchKit
extension can update those UI

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:56.456
elements, including
hiding, showing,

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:57.946
or animating them as needed.

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:01.196
Additionally, your WatchKit
extension can send dynamically

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.846
generated content over to
the Watch app for display.

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:09.106
So in Interface Controller
manages the UI elements

00:04:09.106 --> 00:04:10.466
for a single stream of content.

00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:12.876
It sets the initial
values of those elements,

00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:14.696
responds to user interactions,

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.926
and updates the UI
as appropriate.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:20.026
When you create your
Interface Controller subclass,

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:23.476
you add outlets for each UI
element you need to manage.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.416
These outlets connect to
objects in your storyboard

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:28.386
and handle the transfer
of information

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:31.536
between your WatchKit
extension and Watch app.

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:34.896
In addition to outlets,
you set up action methods

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:37.446
for the interactive
elements of your storyboard,

00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:41.096
and as with outlets, you
connect each action method

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.896
to the corresponding UI element.

00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:46.516
And when the wearer interacts
with that element on the Watch,

00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:49.606
WatchKit will then call
your action method.

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:52.816
So let's get started
thinking about how

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:55.446
to modify an existing
iPhone app.

00:04:56.276 --> 00:05:00.776
So in the run-up to WWDC, I
have been a little forgetful

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:03.296
about contacting people such
as my family and friends,

00:05:03.906 --> 00:05:06.256
so I wanted to create
an app that reminds me

00:05:06.256 --> 00:05:08.066
who I have contacted
and who I haven't,

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:12.626
and it's called WWDC Call Me
Lately and helps notify me

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:13.596
when I should contact them.

00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:17.226
So I communicate with
my server to keep track

00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:19.836
of the people I need to
contact via NSURLSession.

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:23.626
This is a great iOS
app I made, but really,

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:25.956
it makes even more
sense as a Watch app.

00:05:26.686 --> 00:05:31.566
When I am busy, I quickly can
know who I need to contact next.

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:34.686
Let's get started
making our Watch app.

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:37.306
So what I want to do is
I want to show you how

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:40.046
to add a Watch app target
to an existing iOS app,

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:42.666
and then we are going
to walk through where

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:44.596
to get started configuring
your interface.

00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:46.996
And lastly, we are
going to build and run

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:48.746
to see how things
look in the simulator.

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:51.416
So speaking of the simulator,

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.886
we actually have a brand-new
simulator in the watchOS 2 SDK.

00:05:56.086 --> 00:05:59.256
So you guys are all probably
familiar with the iOS simulator,

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:00.476
and it looks something
like this.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:03.596
And now we have a
new Watch simulator.

00:06:04.326 --> 00:06:07.446
So what's great about this is
it's a fully fledged simulator,

00:06:07.516 --> 00:06:10.646
so we can easily look
at our 38-millimeter

00:06:10.646 --> 00:06:12.216
and 42-millimeter sizes.

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:14.936
We can simulate touch pressure.

00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:18.116
We can also look at
different clock faces.

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:20.786
So like I mentioned earlier,
there's now the ability

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:25.246
to support Complications in
watchOS 2, and so you can look

00:06:25.246 --> 00:06:27.386
at how your Complication views

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.616
in different clock
faces in the simulator.

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:32.676
And lastly, you can have
multiple apps installed

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:33.406
at the same time.

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:36.216
So we think this is going to
be a really great way for you

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:38.706
to easily make a new
project, iterate on an idea,

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:43.266
and then quickly go back and
forth between different apps.

00:06:44.456 --> 00:06:47.876
So to simulate touch pressure,
you go into the Simulator menu,

00:06:47.876 --> 00:06:50.316
and you go to Hardware,
Simulate Touch Pressure,

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:53.046
and then you can
select the Deep Press.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:55.346
This is useful for
things like wanting

00:06:55.346 --> 00:06:58.576
to change the clock
face in the sim.

00:06:58.576 --> 00:07:02.286
Now let's jump into Xcode and
see how we can add our Watch app

00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:03.866
and use this brand-new
simulator.

00:07:04.196 --> 00:07:18.416
So let's go to demo.

00:07:18.556 --> 00:07:19.896
Great. So let's launch Xcode.

00:07:20.536 --> 00:07:23.866
And let's select our app.

00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:28.436
And let's make this a
little bit easier to view.

00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:32.926
Great. So now if I wanted to
add a new app, I would just go

00:07:32.926 --> 00:07:41.396
to File, New Target, and then
I now have a new watchOS pane,

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:43.706
so I have an application
and framework in library.

00:07:43.766 --> 00:07:47.016
I select Framework In Library
so I can add a Watch framework

00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:48.286
or Watch static library.

00:07:48.746 --> 00:07:51.966
For now I am going to
add a WatchKit app.

00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:56.896
I double-click, add
a product name,

00:07:56.896 --> 00:08:00.146
and my main app is always
going to be enabled by default,

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.326
but I can also include
a Notification scene,

00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:04.326
a Glance scene, and
a Complication.

00:08:04.996 --> 00:08:06.036
So I can add those here.

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:08.316
I already added it to this app.

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:09.766
Let's just press Cancel.

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:12.806
Now let's see what we are given.

00:08:13.796 --> 00:08:16.736
Here is our Watch app, and
here is our WatchKit extension.

00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:18.326
Like I mentioned before,

00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:20.646
our Watch app contains
our storyboard,

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:23.746
all our static resources,
and our asset catalog.

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:26.406
Our WatchKit extension will
contain all our interface

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:31.966
controllers and any other
code we might want to add.

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:33.496
Let's go into the storyboard.

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:39.826
So now, as you can see,
I have a main interface,

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:42.606
I have my Glance interface,
and then I have my static

00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:45.056
and dynamic interface
for my notification.

00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:48.516
Now, let's also go into
the utilities inspector,

00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:51.906
and I can look at the
object library and see

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:55.026
that I have a lot of different
objects here that I can use,

00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:59.486
and I have all my WatchKit
interface elements as well.

00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:02.546
So let's just drag and drop
an interface controller over.

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:06.276
For instance, if I wanted

00:09:06.276 --> 00:09:08.686
to very simply make
a page controller,

00:09:08.686 --> 00:09:12.426
I could select Control on
my keyboard and then drag

00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:14.016
over to my new interface
controller

00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:17.386
and create a segue
for next page.

00:09:17.596 --> 00:09:23.136
So for now, we'll just get rid
of that, and if you see below,

00:09:23.136 --> 00:09:25.506
there's a static interface
and a dynamic interface,

00:09:25.696 --> 00:09:28.276
so the dynamic interface
is actually what hooks

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.196
up to your Notification
Controller class.

00:09:30.686 --> 00:09:33.836
So when your user first
raises their wrist

00:09:33.836 --> 00:09:36.476
when they get your notification
and then they see it,

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:38.686
your Notification Controller
class will get called,

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:41.456
and you can provide
a very rich UI there.

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:46.266
Now, your static interface is
typically going to be invoked

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:49.386
when the user, for example,
misses your notification

00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:51.586
and goes to view it again
in the Notification Center,

00:09:51.886 --> 00:09:54.016
and that's typically when you
will see the static interface.

00:09:56.076 --> 00:10:00.376
So also, I have this
My Category here.

00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:05.066
So for different categories that
we send for different payloads,

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:08.236
we can actually create custom
UIs and custom notifications

00:10:08.786 --> 00:10:10.276
for those different categories.

00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:13.696
So it's not just one
interface for one --

00:10:14.126 --> 00:10:16.406
for all of the notifications
you send.

00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:19.516
You can actually modify this
and create multiple interfaces.

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:22.876
So let's just add a new
notification controller.

00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:28.316
Let's place that here.

00:10:29.206 --> 00:10:32.546
So if I wanted to, I could drag
over an interface controller

00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:35.166
and then, just like I did
before, I would Control-click,

00:10:35.166 --> 00:10:37.276
and then create my
new dynamic interface.

00:10:38.126 --> 00:10:41.436
Or I can also just go here
into the attributes inspector

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:43.446
and select Has Dynamic
Interface.

00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:46.706
So now I can modify my category

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:48.046
and I can create
a new interface,

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:50.086
and then I possibly would want

00:10:50.086 --> 00:10:53.216
to create a new Notification
Controller class

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:54.746
and then hook that up as well.

00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:58.886
So also we have given to us

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:02.296
by the template a push
notification payload .apns file.

00:11:03.306 --> 00:11:05.206
If you see here, this looks just

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.836
like a normal payload
we might have.

00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:10.586
It has an alert, a body,
a title, a category.

00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:13.906
What's great about this
is in the simulator,

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.316
we can use these
different payload files

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:18.136
and mockup different interfaces.

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:21.836
If we want to test out all of
these different notifications,

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:23.586
we don't have to
just do it to device.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.886
We can now quickly iterate

00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:27.856
on different ideas
using the simulator

00:11:27.856 --> 00:11:29.386
and these notification payloads.

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:32.896
So let's go back
to my storyboard.

00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:35.246
So now I just want
to build and run

00:11:35.676 --> 00:11:37.756
and view my main app
in the simulator.

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:40.346
So I am going to go
up to my schemes,

00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:44.726
and I see I have my iOS scheme
and then my WatchKit app scheme.

00:11:45.596 --> 00:11:48.776
And then I have two simulators
here, an iPhone 6 Plus

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:49.796
with a 38-millimeter

00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:52.566
and an iPhone 6 Plus
with a 42-millimeter.

00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:55.546
As I mentioned before, this
is actually a full simulator

00:11:55.546 --> 00:11:56.106
for the Watch.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.916
It's actually going to be
paired with my iPhone sim,

00:12:00.096 --> 00:12:06.256
so let's select the iPhone 6
scheme, and let's build and run,

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.896
and now I have two
simulators open.

00:12:11.136 --> 00:12:15.836
So what I expect to have happen
is that the main app will launch

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:17.786
and I will get attached
to it in the debugger.

00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:22.296
So great. So let's press Allow,
because I do want to allow this.

00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:24.676
And now I am attaching
the debugger,

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:27.706
and I have a small thing
that has appeared here,

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.806
it says "extension
received request to wake

00:12:29.806 --> 00:12:31.246
up for complication support."

00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:34.346
So if I were to implement
my Complication,

00:12:34.756 --> 00:12:37.266
this would later go away.

00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:40.626
So now let's just stop
this debug session.

00:12:41.056 --> 00:12:42.526
Let's go back to our Watch sim.

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:46.366
So here's my new simulator.

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:47.296
I have my clock face.

00:12:47.686 --> 00:12:50.826
Now if I really just wanted
to change out my clock face,

00:12:50.826 --> 00:12:53.826
I can go into Hardware,
Simulate Touch Pressure,

00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:58.666
and now I can simulate a deep
press, then I can go back

00:12:59.406 --> 00:13:02.756
to a shallow press, and then
I can modify my clock face.

00:13:03.766 --> 00:13:06.006
Now I can customize my
clock in the simulator.

00:13:06.946 --> 00:13:09.846
So if I were to go to
this screen on a device,

00:13:09.846 --> 00:13:11.196
I would use my Digital Crown,

00:13:11.196 --> 00:13:12.716
and then I would
easily change the color.

00:13:13.076 --> 00:13:15.196
So there isn't a Digital
Crown on my mouse,

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:18.026
but thankfully I
have a scroll wheel,

00:13:18.446 --> 00:13:20.956
and I can use the
trackpad or Magic Mouse,

00:13:21.956 --> 00:13:23.656
and I can change
the color as such.

00:13:23.726 --> 00:13:26.066
Now I can simulate the
Digital Crown behavior.

00:13:26.976 --> 00:13:29.376
Also, when I am in my
Complications view,

00:13:29.686 --> 00:13:34.956
as I swipe over, I can
then enable my Complication

00:13:35.206 --> 00:13:38.826
that I have, and so if I am
iterating on Complication ideas,

00:13:38.826 --> 00:13:41.496
I want to build some
new Complications

00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:44.116
on different faces, I would
just enable these Complications

00:13:44.116 --> 00:13:44.656
as such.

00:13:45.956 --> 00:13:49.456
So for now, let's just go back,
and let's do Command-Shift-H

00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:54.956
for home, and let's select and
then do Command-Shift-H again.

00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:58.186
So now I am at the Home screen,
so I have my Settings app,

00:13:58.446 --> 00:14:00.146
my clock face, and
the app I have.

00:14:00.976 --> 00:14:04.286
And then I can launch my
app and see it as I expect.

00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:08.946
So let's go back home.

00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:12.216
And now, like I mentioned,
these sims are paired.

00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:14.426
I have two different
sims to choose from.

00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:17.266
I go into schemes and
I see my two sims.

00:14:17.686 --> 00:14:19.256
But what happens if I want

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:22.306
to have an iPhone 5 sim
with a 42-millimeter?

00:14:22.346 --> 00:14:25.526
I am going to make a new sim
and have it paired for me.

00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:31.556
So let's go into Xcode and then
select Window, and then Devices.

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:35.496
And so now in my sidebar, I have
all of my different simulators.

00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:39.326
So if I go to the bottom left,
I can then add a simulator.

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:41.856
So I can call it iPhone 5.

00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:44.976
Change my device type.

00:14:45.546 --> 00:14:47.266
I will keep my iOS version.

00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:50.756
I will change the paired
watch to be a 42-millimeter,

00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:53.476
so I can easily create that.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:57.196
Now if I go back to my scheme,
there's my new simulator.

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.836
So let's go back
to the storyboard.

00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:08.686
And so as I mentioned,
there's these schemes

00:15:08.686 --> 00:15:11.286
that we can pick from, so
there's a Notification scheme,

00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:13.566
there's Glance scheme,
and a Complication,

00:15:13.566 --> 00:15:15.266
so I can select these
different schemes

00:15:15.676 --> 00:15:17.516
and quickly debug
those parts of my app.

00:15:18.616 --> 00:15:21.256
And now, for example,
I want to just test

00:15:21.256 --> 00:15:22.436
out my Notification scheme,

00:15:22.436 --> 00:15:24.386
I want to see how it
looks in the simulator.

00:15:24.846 --> 00:15:26.526
We already talked
about the APNS files.

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:30.356
I want to see that
appropriately appear.

00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:33.486
So let's just add a label
to my dynamic interface.

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:35.726
And let's drag it over.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:40.536
And let's just rename
this Dynamic.

00:15:40.636 --> 00:15:42.916
So now I selected my
Notification scheme,

00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:46.236
and I am just going to build
and run this to the simulator.

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:53.556
So what I want to have
happen is on the Watch sim,

00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:57.346
my notification will appear,
and then it says Dynamic,

00:15:57.806 --> 00:16:03.816
and that's all it
should say for now.

00:16:04.056 --> 00:16:07.006
So here's my notification,
and it says Test Message,

00:16:07.606 --> 00:16:10.246
so I am going to
look into my console.

00:16:10.996 --> 00:16:13.726
It says "took too long to
show custom notification.

00:16:13.726 --> 00:16:14.896
Falling back to static."

00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:19.376
Okay. So let me look into
my notification controller

00:16:19.376 --> 00:16:20.656
and see why that
might have occurred.

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:23.676
Here is my code for my
notification controller.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:27.566
I go down.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:31.226
Okay, so my Did Receive Remote
Notification is commented out.

00:16:31.226 --> 00:16:33.186
I should probably
uncomment this.

00:16:37.056 --> 00:16:40.516
And now let's just
build and run again.

00:16:40.736 --> 00:16:43.956
So now hopefully, after I
dismiss the old notification,

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:46.176
I should then see my new one,

00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:47.676
and it says Dynamic
like I expect.

00:16:48.596 --> 00:16:52.676
So on device, if I was in this
scenario and got a notification,

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:54.696
I could select the
App icon or button

00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:56.096
and I would be taken
right to the app.

00:16:56.466 --> 00:16:58.756
So I can just do the same
thing here in the simulator,

00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:08.246
and I am taken right
to the app as I expect.

00:17:08.376 --> 00:17:13.596
So now I could flesh out this
code and add a great UI story

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:16.326
in my notification,
and I still want

00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:18.146
to be testing my
static interface.

00:17:18.296 --> 00:17:21.886
The only way I just saw that
happen was I had to comment

00:17:21.886 --> 00:17:23.866
out Did Receive Remote
Notification

00:17:23.866 --> 00:17:25.996
to get my static interface,
and I don't want to be doing

00:17:25.996 --> 00:17:28.215
that while I am iterating
on my code.

00:17:28.876 --> 00:17:30.726
So there's a couple
ways I can do this.

00:17:31.026 --> 00:17:34.186
One, I can change this custom
in my completion handler

00:17:34.416 --> 00:17:38.486
to call Default, or I can
actually go into my schemes,

00:17:39.336 --> 00:17:44.886
I can edit the scheme, and now
I can choose my Watch interface.

00:17:44.886 --> 00:17:48.316
So I can change it to be a
static notification rather

00:17:48.316 --> 00:17:50.966
than a dynamic, and
as you can see,

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:52.776
here's my push notification
payload.

00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:55.396
So if I had multiple payloads,
they would appear here,

00:17:55.656 --> 00:17:57.036
and I can quickly change

00:17:57.036 --> 00:18:00.796
out which payload I
am trying to test.

00:18:00.966 --> 00:18:05.166
So for my purposes, I might
want to keep a static scheme

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:07.826
around for a while, so I am just
going to duplicate this scheme.

00:18:09.106 --> 00:18:10.866
Let's call it Static
Notification.

00:18:10.866 --> 00:18:15.526
Then let's go to Run.

00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:18.176
Then I change my Watch
interface to be static.

00:18:19.126 --> 00:18:20.376
Let's press Close.

00:18:21.146 --> 00:18:23.336
So now I have a static
notification as well

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:25.086
as my normal dynamic
notification.

00:18:26.976 --> 00:18:29.676
So this is great, and
we have the beginning

00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:33.266
of a template project here, but
let's understand some context

00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:35.436
of how the app life
cycle works on watchOS.

00:18:35.436 --> 00:18:46.846
So let's go through the
life cycle of a watchOS app.

00:18:47.716 --> 00:18:50.756
So we looked at the interface
for the Watch app but haven't

00:18:50.756 --> 00:18:52.216
yet observed its life cycle.

00:18:52.676 --> 00:18:54.486
It's important to know
when the extension

00:18:54.486 --> 00:18:57.686
and interface controller get
called for setup and tear-down

00:18:58.066 --> 00:19:01.136
so you are configuring UI
elements at the right time,

00:19:01.236 --> 00:19:04.456
as well as performing cleanup
operations or finishing tasks

00:19:04.556 --> 00:19:06.616
when the wearer stops
interacting with your Watch app.

00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:08.876
When your Watch app is launched,

00:19:08.876 --> 00:19:12.796
the extension delegate
will get Application Did

00:19:12.796 --> 00:19:13.506
Finish Launching.

00:19:13.926 --> 00:19:15.526
The extension delegate
is analogous

00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:17.336
to UI application
delegate on iOS.

00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:21.146
As such, you will also receive
an Application Did Become Active

00:19:21.146 --> 00:19:23.586
callback to allow you to
update your model data.

00:19:24.866 --> 00:19:27.466
Next, the storyboard in your
Watch app bundle is loaded

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:30.586
on Apple Watch, and the initial
interface controller is created.

00:19:31.356 --> 00:19:32.916
Once the UI is initialized,

00:19:33.186 --> 00:19:35.366
your interface controller
will receive an Awake

00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:38.566
With Context call, giving it a
chance to initialize variables

00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:40.956
for state and configure
UI elements

00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:41.876
with their initial values.

00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:45.546
When the UI of your Watch
app is in the process

00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:49.196
of getting displayed on screen,
Will Activate will be called,

00:19:49.376 --> 00:19:51.886
allowing you to perform
any last-minute tasks

00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:53.886
or final UI element
configurations.

00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:57.056
And now, as the wearer
interacts with UI elements,

00:19:57.236 --> 00:19:59.446
WatchKit calls the
action methods you defined

00:19:59.446 --> 00:20:00.646
on your interface controller.

00:20:01.336 --> 00:20:04.536
Those action methods are
your chance to execute code

00:20:04.976 --> 00:20:07.196
and update your app's UI.

00:20:07.196 --> 00:20:09.196
Keep in mind that
engagement times are short.

00:20:09.816 --> 00:20:13.336
On iOS, we traditionally think
in terms of our user interacting

00:20:13.336 --> 00:20:16.476
with our app in a sense of
minutes, but on watchOS,

00:20:16.656 --> 00:20:18.456
we are going to be thinking
in terms of seconds.

00:20:19.306 --> 00:20:22.686
Actually, we are going to
hit a Did Deactivate call

00:20:22.686 --> 00:20:25.826
after the wearer stops
interacting with our app.

00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:30.136
And after that method is
called, then at some point

00:20:30.136 --> 00:20:33.396
in the future, the
interface controller will then

00:20:33.526 --> 00:20:34.426
get deallocated.

00:20:34.996 --> 00:20:38.156
And now our extension delegate,

00:20:38.156 --> 00:20:39.676
after the wearer
stops interacting

00:20:39.676 --> 00:20:42.356
with the watch completely --
for example, they might go back

00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:45.776
to the Home screen -- you will
receive an Application Will

00:20:45.776 --> 00:20:49.256
Resign Active callback, and
so this is your opportunity

00:20:49.606 --> 00:20:52.666
to save any app-related
state information and close

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.516
out any ongoing tasks.

00:20:56.436 --> 00:20:59.306
So we know the life cycle
of the WatchKit extension,

00:20:59.556 --> 00:21:01.096
but another important
thing to talk

00:21:01.096 --> 00:21:03.666
about is the layout
of the Watch app.

00:21:04.936 --> 00:21:11.326
So the model in watchOS for
WatchKit is different from UIKit

00:21:11.326 --> 00:21:13.886
and AppKit because it's
a flow-based layout.

00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:18.386
So all of our elements
go one after another,

00:21:19.416 --> 00:21:22.446
and our UI is primarily
created in Interface Builder.

00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:25.636
So when we have an
interface controller,

00:21:25.636 --> 00:21:28.696
we can use our object
library and just drag an image

00:21:29.026 --> 00:21:32.686
or drag a button, and then
in the instances when we want

00:21:32.686 --> 00:21:36.996
to have a slightly
more involved layout,

00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:39.446
we could use a WK
interface group,

00:21:39.536 --> 00:21:42.676
which will just manage the
layout for different items.

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.986
So for example, we
could add an image

00:21:44.986 --> 00:21:46.086
and a label into the group.

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:50.496
And so the programming model
is really important to note.

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:53.726
You don't write object
creation code with WatchKit.

00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:57.036
You have fine-tuned control
in the Interface Builder

00:21:57.866 --> 00:22:02.806
of positioning and sizing, the
layout hierarchy, and animation.

00:22:03.396 --> 00:22:07.636
And I highly encourage
you to go to the Layout

00:22:07.636 --> 00:22:11.266
and Animation Techniques talk
for WatchKit on Thursday.

00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:12.896
It's going to be a
great session on how

00:22:12.896 --> 00:22:15.786
to create really rich
UIs for your users.

00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:19.466
And so I've been thinking about
how best to make my Watch app,

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:23.156
and if you recall, my iOS app
is just a simple UI table view.

00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:26.956
So my first idea was to have
a list of all the people

00:22:26.956 --> 00:22:29.676
that I need to call, very
similar to my iOS app,

00:22:30.326 --> 00:22:31.926
and when I started
thinking about it,

00:22:31.926 --> 00:22:35.916
I realized I don't need all that
information in my Watch app.

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:38.936
Really, I just want to know
who next to call rather

00:22:38.936 --> 00:22:41.126
than knowing a list of
all those I should call.

00:22:41.546 --> 00:22:43.686
So my UI might look
something like this.

00:22:44.486 --> 00:22:46.726
So great. Now I have an
idea of what I want to make,

00:22:47.406 --> 00:22:49.256
and I want to start
creating my UI.

00:22:49.796 --> 00:22:53.156
So I am going to walk
through how to create your UI

00:22:53.156 --> 00:22:55.906
for your main app, your
Glance, and your Notification.

00:22:56.406 --> 00:23:00.226
So let's jump into Xcode
and see what we have.

00:23:00.426 --> 00:23:02.286
So we understand what
the life cycle is

00:23:02.286 --> 00:23:04.366
and generally speaking
what the layout is,

00:23:04.546 --> 00:23:05.926
so let's go into our storyboard.

00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:10.596
If I wanted to add an image
to my interface controller,

00:23:10.946 --> 00:23:12.766
I would select it here
in the object library,

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:16.706
and then I can just
quickly drag an image over,

00:23:17.686 --> 00:23:19.466
and now I just want to
add a label as well.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:23.516
So let's just find the
label and drag it over.

00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:26.226
And if you notice,
a blue line appears,

00:23:26.296 --> 00:23:30.116
so in my flow-based layout,
I can position my label to be

00:23:30.196 --> 00:23:32.056
after or before my image.

00:23:32.496 --> 00:23:35.046
So let's place it after.

00:23:35.236 --> 00:23:38.656
Now, for instance, if I want
to place them horizontally next

00:23:38.656 --> 00:23:40.166
to one another, I could --

00:23:41.116 --> 00:23:43.906
okay, so I can't actually do
this in Interface Builder.

00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:45.956
There's no blue line that
appears to help me out.

00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:51.286
So let me use a WK
interface group to do this.

00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:55.416
So let's drag this over,
resize our image a bit,

00:23:56.796 --> 00:23:58.756
and now let's add the
label into the group,

00:23:58.756 --> 00:24:02.106
and then let's also add the
image right next to the label.

00:24:02.226 --> 00:24:04.286
So this is how it can
position things horizontally.

00:24:05.326 --> 00:24:08.826
So for now, let's take our
label out and our image out,

00:24:08.826 --> 00:24:10.776
and let's just delete the group,

00:24:11.976 --> 00:24:13.686
and then in my attributes
inspector,

00:24:14.206 --> 00:24:15.406
already in my asset catalog,

00:24:15.406 --> 00:24:17.036
I have an image for
my friend, Ethan.

00:24:17.806 --> 00:24:20.976
So let's just reference
that image.

00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:22.706
Ethan looks a little squished.

00:24:22.876 --> 00:24:25.156
Let's make him look
a little bit happier.

00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:27.456
There we go.

00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:28.366
He seems pretty happy.

00:24:28.796 --> 00:24:33.246
So let's also change the
label text to be Ethan.

00:24:33.246 --> 00:24:35.986
Now my layout is positioned
-- it's left-aligned,

00:24:36.446 --> 00:24:39.116
so I actually want to position
it centered in the screen.

00:24:39.706 --> 00:24:41.816
So if I just select on my image,

00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:43.676
then go to my attributes
inspector,

00:24:44.266 --> 00:24:46.996
and I can change the
position to be in the center.

00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:50.996
Then I can also change
the position vertically,

00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:53.346
I can change the size,
I can change the view

00:24:53.346 --> 00:24:56.376
for this particular image, and
I can do the same for my label.

00:24:56.436 --> 00:25:00.096
I just want to position
it in the center.

00:25:00.096 --> 00:25:01.786
Now let's move on to the Glance.

00:25:01.996 --> 00:25:05.226
If you notice, this Glance
controller looks different

00:25:05.226 --> 00:25:05.766
than our main app.

00:25:06.216 --> 00:25:07.226
There's two groups here.

00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:09.696
That's because Glances
are actually templated.

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:12.406
So I have an upper template
and a lower template.

00:25:12.736 --> 00:25:16.566
So if I select in my attributes
inspector my upper template,

00:25:16.746 --> 00:25:18.996
I have a list of options
that I can choose from.

00:25:19.826 --> 00:25:23.246
So for this particular case,
let's just have a large text,

00:25:24.036 --> 00:25:25.876
and let's change it to be Call.

00:25:28.096 --> 00:25:31.716
Then let's add an image
to my lower template.

00:25:32.396 --> 00:25:35.146
I am going to do the
same thing as before,

00:25:35.146 --> 00:25:37.826
just change the image
to reference Ethan.

00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:41.776
So when I look at my Glance,
I really kind of want the app

00:25:41.816 --> 00:25:44.116
to scream at me because I am
really bad about calling Ethan,

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:49.646
so the app will help me do that.

00:25:49.836 --> 00:25:52.156
And so also I can
do the same thing

00:25:52.156 --> 00:25:54.356
for my notification
interfaces as well.

00:25:54.356 --> 00:25:58.986
So for the most part, I
figured out my new interface,

00:25:59.446 --> 00:26:02.916
and now let's just build
and run the interface

00:26:02.916 --> 00:26:04.016
by selecting the schemes.

00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:07.666
Let's build and run
to the Watch sim.

00:26:08.596 --> 00:26:20.806
So I just expect my new
interface to appear.

00:26:20.836 --> 00:26:21.666
Okay. Great.

00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.656
So there it is, and I have
attached in the debugger.

00:26:24.466 --> 00:26:27.106
So let's just stop this session,
and now let's take a look

00:26:27.106 --> 00:26:28.836
at the iOS sim because
it's important

00:26:28.836 --> 00:26:30.516
to note these are
paired devices.

00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:34.426
So I scroll up, and
I pan to the right.

00:26:35.036 --> 00:26:37.536
I see I have my iOS
app installed,

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:41.046
so just like on a device, the
only way your app will get

00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:43.726
to a user's Watch is
by also being installed

00:26:43.726 --> 00:26:45.106
on the iOS device.

00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:47.116
And so this is what's
happened here.

00:26:47.646 --> 00:26:51.116
Now let's select our Apple
Watch app, and in the simulator,

00:26:51.346 --> 00:26:53.026
I can change out
my Complications.

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:56.006
So Call Me Lately
is already enabled.

00:26:56.006 --> 00:27:02.016
I can also uninstall my
app and reinstall it,

00:27:02.016 --> 00:27:05.576
and I can also disable my
Glance and reenable it.

00:27:06.706 --> 00:27:08.226
So if I wanted to
view my Glance,

00:27:08.226 --> 00:27:11.816
I could go in the simulator,
go back to my clock face,

00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:16.636
and just like on device, I
swipe up, and then my Glance --

00:27:17.046 --> 00:27:19.046
so let's just reenable it.

00:27:19.046 --> 00:27:22.406
So -- oh, excuse me.

00:27:22.406 --> 00:27:24.096
So I would expect
my new UI to appear.

00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:28.536
That hasn't happened, but
let's just move on for now.

00:27:28.776 --> 00:27:32.196
So I figured out my new
interface, but I need to know

00:27:32.196 --> 00:27:34.406
who the next person is, and
I need to figure out how

00:27:34.406 --> 00:27:37.326
to update my app to do this.

00:27:37.466 --> 00:27:42.496
So let's go back to slides.

00:27:42.496 --> 00:27:44.576
So my iOS app mainly
communicates

00:27:44.576 --> 00:27:48.126
to my server via NSURLSession
to get my list of loved ones.

00:27:48.656 --> 00:27:51.166
What's great is in
watchOS 2, I can use a lot

00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:54.206
of the same NSURLSession
code to talk to my server.

00:27:55.276 --> 00:27:57.196
However, there are times
when I need to make sure

00:27:57.196 --> 00:28:00.506
that my iOS app and watchOS app
are in touch with each other,

00:28:00.866 --> 00:28:02.846
and I can use WatchConnectivity
to do so.

00:28:03.596 --> 00:28:05.976
So let's take a moment and talk

00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:08.906
about the new WatchConnectivity
framework before we see how we

00:28:08.906 --> 00:28:10.376
can use it in Call Me Lately.

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:14.126
So WatchConnectivity
is a framework

00:28:14.176 --> 00:28:17.496
that has four core
uses for communication

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:19.326
between iOS and watchOS.

00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:22.636
An important thing to note is
that WatchConnectivity lives

00:28:22.636 --> 00:28:27.556
on both iOS and watchOS, so you
can use APIs on both platforms.

00:28:27.926 --> 00:28:30.646
This isn't just your Watch
app talking to your iOS app

00:28:30.646 --> 00:28:32.796
when there are times when
you want your iOS app

00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:33.986
to be updating your Watch app.

00:28:34.986 --> 00:28:37.186
So the first use is
to allow your iOS app

00:28:37.426 --> 00:28:39.746
to update your Watch
app's application context,

00:28:39.746 --> 00:28:40.646
and vice versa.

00:28:41.256 --> 00:28:44.056
This may not be urgent data, but
something you know you'll want

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.156
to update your user with.

00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:47.316
The second is Send Message.

00:28:47.716 --> 00:28:50.106
This is for small pieces
of information that I need

00:28:50.106 --> 00:28:51.476
to transfer back and forth

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:53.946
between my iOS app
and Watch app.

00:28:54.756 --> 00:28:56.946
And the third is a
simple transfer file API.

00:28:57.866 --> 00:29:01.156
And lastly, there's a transfer
user info API that ties in more

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.176
so with Complications.

00:29:03.566 --> 00:29:06.376
There's also a wider range
of things you can accomplish,

00:29:06.376 --> 00:29:09.266
and I encourage you to go to
the talk on WatchConnectivity

00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:10.626
to find out more information.

00:29:11.376 --> 00:29:14.906
Let's see in Call Me
Lately how I can best

00:29:14.906 --> 00:29:16.066
use WatchConnectivity.

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:19.616
I just want to add
WatchConnectivity to my app,

00:29:19.616 --> 00:29:23.396
I want to debug it,
and lastly I want

00:29:23.436 --> 00:29:25.676
to just profile it
with Instruments.

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:28.626
So speaking of Instruments,
for those that don't know,

00:29:28.946 --> 00:29:32.016
Instruments is a powerful
profiling tool to check

00:29:32.126 --> 00:29:34.496
out the performance of your app.

00:29:34.676 --> 00:29:36.606
So you will get a
profiling template

00:29:36.876 --> 00:29:40.406
when you first initially launch
Instruments, and you can pick

00:29:40.406 --> 00:29:44.056
from a time profiler,
leaks, allocations,

00:29:44.646 --> 00:29:48.866
and then you will see something,
if I select a time profiler,

00:29:48.866 --> 00:29:50.386
for instance, this is
the view I would see,

00:29:50.386 --> 00:29:53.536
and I can easily profile my app.

00:29:53.796 --> 00:29:55.276
And it's really important,

00:29:55.746 --> 00:29:57.816
so engagement times
are short on the Watch.

00:29:57.816 --> 00:30:00.126
So this means that
performance is critical,

00:30:00.726 --> 00:30:02.966
and we want to be using
Instruments to make sure

00:30:02.966 --> 00:30:06.736
that our app is giving
a good user experience,

00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:09.376
and we want to check it out
on both device and simulator.

00:30:10.146 --> 00:30:12.956
So now that we know a little
bit about WatchConnectivity

00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:14.826
and Instruments, let's
go into demo again.

00:30:15.426 --> 00:30:20.806
So in my app, I might have an
algorithm of sorts that says,

00:30:20.906 --> 00:30:22.816
oh, this is the next
person I want to call.

00:30:22.816 --> 00:30:25.646
And so when I have
this data available,

00:30:26.196 --> 00:30:30.246
I want to update my iOS app
to know who is the person

00:30:30.246 --> 00:30:31.536
that I am viewing on my Watch

00:30:31.536 --> 00:30:32.986
and the person I
should next call.

00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:36.046
So I might want to maybe
on the initial launch

00:30:36.046 --> 00:30:38.316
of the app just update
my application context

00:30:38.586 --> 00:30:41.376
over to the iOS app
and see that appear.

00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:44.836
So I would probably
just want to do this

00:30:44.836 --> 00:30:47.656
on my Application Did Become
Active in my extension delegate.

00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:51.476
So here I could just
place this code.

00:30:51.476 --> 00:30:53.896
So let me first import
WatchConnectivity.

00:31:00.236 --> 00:31:02.436
And now in Application
Did Become Active,

00:31:02.516 --> 00:31:03.556
I would add some code,

00:31:03.706 --> 00:31:06.746
just create a context
that's a string named Ethan,

00:31:06.746 --> 00:31:10.326
and then on WC Session, which
is part of WatchConnectivity,

00:31:10.456 --> 00:31:12.286
I have the default session

00:31:12.286 --> 00:31:14.446
and I call the method
Update Application Context

00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:17.526
with the key WC Application
Context,

00:31:17.936 --> 00:31:19.636
and I would just
send over my context.

00:31:19.976 --> 00:31:22.106
And worse comes to
worst, I am just going

00:31:22.106 --> 00:31:23.736
to print my error for now.

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.456
So let's see this work.

00:31:27.286 --> 00:31:34.786
And let's build and run.

00:31:34.986 --> 00:31:36.566
Let's select our Watch app.

00:31:37.496 --> 00:31:45.976
My app launched, but I see
a WC error domain, 7004,

00:31:45.976 --> 00:31:49.026
so I know from previous
experience

00:31:49.026 --> 00:31:50.826
that my session just
isn't activated.

00:31:51.406 --> 00:31:52.636
Let's take a look at my code.

00:31:52.636 --> 00:31:56.166
I also haven't set
my delegate either,

00:31:56.396 --> 00:32:02.086
so I want to set a WC session
delegate, and then after --

00:32:02.736 --> 00:32:05.756
or before my update
application context code,

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:10.836
I just want to set the delegate
to be myself, and then I want

00:32:10.836 --> 00:32:11.926
to activate my session.

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:13.706
And it's important
to note that you want

00:32:13.706 --> 00:32:15.886
to set the delegate before
activating your session

00:32:16.256 --> 00:32:19.016
because you might have
messages waiting for you

00:32:19.256 --> 00:32:20.576
when you've activated
that session.

00:32:20.986 --> 00:32:23.946
So you want to receive the
appropriate delegate callbacks.

00:32:24.956 --> 00:32:30.246
So now let's just
build and run again.

00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:41.856
Now let's just make sure that
my error code has gone away.

00:32:41.856 --> 00:32:42.546
Okay. Great.

00:32:42.726 --> 00:32:44.056
So I don't have my
error anymore.

00:32:44.526 --> 00:32:47.156
So that means this is
appropriately sending my

00:32:47.156 --> 00:32:49.006
application context
to my iOS app.

00:32:49.306 --> 00:32:51.936
But now I want to see that my
iOS app actually receives it.

00:32:52.446 --> 00:32:54.346
So I can do this
by going to Schemes

00:32:55.166 --> 00:32:58.006
and selecting my iOS
scheme, and I am going

00:32:58.006 --> 00:33:02.376
to select the same simulator
that's paired with my Watch sim.

00:33:02.376 --> 00:33:04.876
So I'm going to select
my iPhone 6 sim.

00:33:05.466 --> 00:33:09.276
Now if I click on Control and
then press on Build and Run,

00:33:09.356 --> 00:33:10.926
I can actually run
without building,

00:33:11.196 --> 00:33:14.556
so this way I don't have to
-- if my app is really large,

00:33:14.556 --> 00:33:16.426
I don't have to wait
for it to keep compiling

00:33:16.426 --> 00:33:18.566
and install the app,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:18.566 --> 00:33:22.196
So let's just press Control
and then run without building.

00:33:23.816 --> 00:33:27.286
So now it looks like my
app launched, and I've hit

00:33:27.286 --> 00:33:29.086
on my app delegate
in my iOS app,

00:33:29.416 --> 00:33:32.616
I've hit my delegate callback,
Did Receive Application Context,

00:33:33.076 --> 00:33:36.316
and I can then update
my UI in my iOS app.

00:33:37.856 --> 00:33:39.376
Let's just continue through.

00:33:40.486 --> 00:33:44.566
So now if I am on my Watch
sim, and let's go back home.

00:33:46.096 --> 00:33:49.806
So my debugging session is
still ongoing in my iOS app,

00:33:50.126 --> 00:33:53.446
and my Watch app, when it's
activated -- excuse me --

00:33:53.586 --> 00:33:56.746
when it's launched, it will then
update my application context.

00:33:58.106 --> 00:34:00.406
So I can hit it again
on my iOS app

00:34:00.406 --> 00:34:01.776
and hit the delegate callback.

00:34:02.326 --> 00:34:05.216
So this is great because you
can now debug in both simulators

00:34:05.216 --> 00:34:07.316
at once, which is really great

00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:09.886
for when you are using
WatchConnectivity,

00:34:09.886 --> 00:34:12.556
so you can make sure all
of your calls are occurring

00:34:12.636 --> 00:34:16.326
in the order you want them
to on both watchOS and iOS.

00:34:16.985 --> 00:34:21.576
(Applause) Thank you.

00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:27.206
Let's just stop the session
for now, and I just want

00:34:27.206 --> 00:34:28.835
to quickly profile
an Instrument.

00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:33.956
So I'm going to hit Product,
Profile, and I am going

00:34:33.956 --> 00:34:38.525
to have Instruments come up, and
I expect my template to appear,

00:34:38.525 --> 00:34:39.525
my template selection.

00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:41.735
So let's find my -- okay.

00:34:41.896 --> 00:34:43.496
Let's find my time profiler.

00:34:44.106 --> 00:34:45.376
Let's just choose that.

00:34:46.036 --> 00:34:49.786
And then instead of my
iOS sim, I actually want

00:34:49.786 --> 00:34:52.456
to be debugging my,
profiling my extension.

00:34:53.295 --> 00:34:54.326
Select that here.

00:34:54.656 --> 00:34:55.766
I can press Record.

00:34:56.666 --> 00:34:58.486
And it looks like
I've hit an error.

00:34:58.486 --> 00:35:01.986
So let's just open up my
Watch sim, place that here.

00:35:03.386 --> 00:35:04.326
Press Record.

00:35:04.656 --> 00:35:07.356
And there I have attached,
and now I can profile my app.

00:35:08.446 --> 00:35:12.456
So in my call tree, I can
also see my sample list just

00:35:12.456 --> 00:35:15.356
like on an iOS app, I can
do the same sorts of things,

00:35:15.596 --> 00:35:17.306
and I can see that most
of my code is being run

00:35:17.306 --> 00:35:19.736
on my main thread
here, which is great,

00:35:19.736 --> 00:35:22.576
and then I can go
back to my call tree.

00:35:23.096 --> 00:35:26.386
And so this is just very simply
you can easily profile something

00:35:26.596 --> 00:35:27.706
using Instruments.

00:35:28.736 --> 00:35:32.466
So let's just stop this session.

00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:34.356
And now I've written an app

00:35:34.356 --> 00:35:37.146
that basically has a
very simple interface

00:35:37.326 --> 00:35:38.756
and uses WatchConnectivity,

00:35:38.756 --> 00:35:40.546
and I've profiled my
app in Instruments.

00:35:40.596 --> 00:35:43.196
Now I could talk
with my designer

00:35:43.196 --> 00:35:44.456
and really flesh this out.

00:35:45.786 --> 00:35:47.956
So let's talk about what
we were just able to do.

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:51.766
So we added a Watch app to
our existing iPhone app.

00:35:52.776 --> 00:35:55.036
We created an interface
for our app and Glance.

00:35:55.956 --> 00:35:57.416
We used WatchConnectivity.

00:35:58.486 --> 00:36:01.656
We debugged our iOS and
watchOS apps at the same time.

00:36:02.866 --> 00:36:04.636
And we profiled our
app in Instruments.

00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:10.136
So these are just a few of the
things that you can get started

00:36:10.136 --> 00:36:14.946
with in WatchKit, and there are
so many other watchOS 2 features

00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:16.486
that I am incredibly
excited about,

00:36:16.986 --> 00:36:19.366
and like I mentioned before,
there's Complications,

00:36:19.736 --> 00:36:22.196
and as you might have seen
in the Keynote yesterday,

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:24.086
you can even do Time Travel,

00:36:24.086 --> 00:36:26.066
which I think is
just the future.

00:36:26.316 --> 00:36:28.276
You can just, like,
go back and forth.

00:36:28.276 --> 00:36:28.866
It's amazing.

00:36:28.866 --> 00:36:29.496
It's so cool.

00:36:29.946 --> 00:36:32.656
And then you can also
use Digital Crown,

00:36:32.656 --> 00:36:34.836
so you can create really
intuitive experiences

00:36:34.836 --> 00:36:37.376
for your users using
the Digital Crown.

00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:42.146
You also have simple animations
to create really responsive apps

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:44.716
for your user, just
nice and playful.

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:47.716
You also have access to
the heart rate sensors,

00:36:47.716 --> 00:36:50.346
so if you are making a Workout
app or some sort of fitness app,

00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:53.906
you now get that data
via HealthKit and can use

00:36:53.906 --> 00:36:56.736
that to provide a better
experience for your user.

00:36:56.936 --> 00:37:00.226
You can also provide a great
experience using haptics

00:37:00.856 --> 00:37:04.286
and lightly tap your user
and provide some context

00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:07.996
as to what you are
doing in the app.

00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:10.136
And there's also media
playback, so like you saw

00:37:10.136 --> 00:37:13.616
in the Keynote yesterday,
you can view a simple video.

00:37:14.156 --> 00:37:18.726
And you can also have
audio playback as well,

00:37:18.726 --> 00:37:20.466
so this would use the
speaker on the Watch,

00:37:20.686 --> 00:37:22.766
or if the user has paired
Bluetooth headphones,

00:37:23.036 --> 00:37:24.746
it would then route
there as well.

00:37:24.746 --> 00:37:28.816
And you can do audio recording,
so for the first time,

00:37:28.816 --> 00:37:31.916
you can get access to the
mic on the Watch itself

00:37:32.076 --> 00:37:33.666
and provide a great experience.

00:37:35.156 --> 00:37:37.536
And you have access
to the Keychain now,

00:37:37.536 --> 00:37:40.266
so you can provide a really
secure experience for your user.

00:37:42.136 --> 00:37:46.956
So in recap, we were able
to discuss the architecture

00:37:47.276 --> 00:37:49.896
of an app, we added a Watch app,

00:37:50.616 --> 00:37:52.396
we talked through
the app life cycle,

00:37:52.996 --> 00:37:55.806
we used the different interface
elements and we made our app

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:58.466
and our Glance, and we talked

00:37:58.466 --> 00:38:00.626
through our notification
interfaces and how

00:38:00.626 --> 00:38:02.816
to easily iterate on
different notifications

00:38:03.166 --> 00:38:05.656
and using different categories
and different payloads.

00:38:06.286 --> 00:38:09.856
And we were able to build
and run in the new simulator,

00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:11.656
and we debugged our app.

00:38:12.926 --> 00:38:15.866
And we were able to use
various watchOS capabilities.

00:38:17.156 --> 00:38:19.606
So there's some great
documentation online,

00:38:19.606 --> 00:38:22.126
the watchOS 2 Transition
Guide is excellent.

00:38:22.126 --> 00:38:24.306
I highly encourage you
guys to all check it out.

00:38:24.306 --> 00:38:25.736
There's some great
technical support.

00:38:25.926 --> 00:38:28.736
You can check out the
Forums, some sample code.

00:38:28.736 --> 00:38:31.686
If you have general inquiries,
please contact Jake Behrens,

00:38:31.686 --> 00:38:33.416
our watchOS framework's
Evangelist.

00:38:34.466 --> 00:38:37.956
There is a lot of really amazing
sessions happening this week,

00:38:38.196 --> 00:38:40.936
there's a lot of info to dig
through, WatchKit in Depth,

00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:44.916
Complications, Layout,
and so much more.

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:49.286
If you have any questions,
if you have general questions

00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:51.066
or you're digging into
the code for a first time,

00:38:51.666 --> 00:38:54.256
or if you are an experienced
WatchKit dev, please come by,

00:38:54.256 --> 00:38:58.316
we will be happy to answer
any questions you might have.

00:38:58.316 --> 00:38:59.186
So thank you, everyone.

00:39:03.796 --> 00:39:04.206
(Applause) Thank you.
