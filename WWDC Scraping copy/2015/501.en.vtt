00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:19.586
>> BRENT FULGHAM: Hello
and welcome to "What's New

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.606
In Web Development and
WebKit and Safari."

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:25.086
My name's Brent Fulgham
and I will be taking you

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:27.846
on a guided tour of some of the
advances we've made this year.

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:30.876
This is an especially
exciting time of year for us,

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:34.406
because throughout most of the
year, we only hear from you

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:38.756
through bug reports and things
told to us by other people,

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:41.576
but this time of year, we have
labs, we have sessions like this

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:44.416
where we can get into all of the
things that we have done to try

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:45.606
to make your lives better.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:50.736
And whether you primarily target
Safari as a web developer,

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.766
or an embedded web view
in a larger application,

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.046
I think you will find a
few things in this talk

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:58.556
that will be useful to
you almost immediately.

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:02.256
So I would like to start with a
brief overview of what WebKit is

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.916
and how it fits into the
software design stack at Apple,

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.126
and then move on to some
enhancements we've made

00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:11.806
in Safari this year
that you will be able

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:12.766
to take advantage of.

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:15.656
And finally, I would
like to talk

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:17.926
about creating some
amazing experiences

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:19.886
for the iOS and Mac platforms.

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:22.126
Technologies that are
available on these platforms

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:23.516
that if you take advantage

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:27.456
of them will really make
your website more compelling

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:29.016
and useful to your customers.

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:32.116
So let's get started
talking about WebKit.

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:34.366
WebKit is our web
browsing engine.

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.576
And it's an open source
project that anyone,

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:39.086
any of you could join.

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:44.016
And while you may know
that WebKit is the engine

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:47.866
that powers Safari, you may
not be aware that it's used

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.676
in a tremendous number of
applications across the spectrum

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:53.876
of things we do at Apple.

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:57.546
WebKit is the same
engine on iOS and OS X

00:01:57.546 --> 00:01:59.236
with very few variations
between them.

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:00.836
So during rest of my talk,

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:02.466
unless I specifically
call something

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.986
out as being available only
on one platform or the other,

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:07.316
you can safely assume that
the things we are talking

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:10.006
about today will be
available on both platforms.

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:14.686
So the takeaway here is that
if you are a web developer

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:17.736
targeting Safari or
any web browser on iOS,

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:20.216
you can use all the things I
am going to talk about today.

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:23.376
And if you are an app developer
with an embedded web view,

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.906
you can use all the
things I'm talking about.

00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:30.146
And if you are a
developer targeting just the

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:34.946
JavaScriptCore framework itself,
or the OS X automation tools,

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.186
you can make use of all
the JavaScript features

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:38.716
that we will talk
about in this session.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:43.726
So that was our introduction
to WebKit, and let's move

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.826
on to the enhancements
we made this year.

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:51.326
So I'm going to break this
down just for structure

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:53.446
into new layout and
rendering features.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.336
Some JavaScript updates
that we made

00:02:56.336 --> 00:03:00.366
to support the new ES6
standard, and CSS features

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:02.606
that will make your
style sheets easier

00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:04.076
to maintain and simpler to read.

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:09.256
So let's talk a little bit
about the enhancements in Safari

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.776
and specifically, layout
and rendering features.

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:14.356
And even more specifically,
I want to talk

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.706
about backdrop effects.

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.786
In iOS 7, the design language

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:20.336
for the user interface
was changed

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:23.156
to incorporate some beautiful
backdrop blur effects.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:27.656
For example, here you can see
the home screen icons just kind

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:29.576
of peeking through that
frosted glass effect.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.596
And this kind of layering
gives a lot of depth

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:36.576
and gives you a sense of what's
happening behind this overlay,

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:39.806
without obstructing the content
that we are trying to view

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:42.076
in the front of the interface.

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:45.586
And later, in OS X Yosemite,

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:47.796
we provided similar
backdrop effects.

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:51.696
Here we have a very subtle blur
in the sidebar of the finder

00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:56.096
and we have this beautiful
frosted glass effect on the doc.

00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:00.696
And so these effects
are important to feel

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:02.006
like a native part
of the system.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.286
And they are the kind of
things you might want to use

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:08.206
in the most refined version of
your webpage for people visiting

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:12.226
on a Mac or iOS device,
but it's doubly important

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:14.286
when you have an embedded
web view that you want

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:17.216
to have be part of the
system, and look like part

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:18.526
of the native user interface.

00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:21.995
But how do you do that?

00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:25.266
Let's say I have an application
that's displaying photos.

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:28.506
There's no obvious way to
create a backdrop effect

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.016
like the ones we saw earlier.

00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:34.026
We can try an overlay with
a translucent background

00:04:34.256 --> 00:04:36.796
but you can see that the
content kind of fights

00:04:36.796 --> 00:04:38.416
with the text on top of it.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:40.396
You know that there are things
behind it and it's difficult,

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:42.136
makes it more difficult to read.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.036
Now, we have CSS filters
and those include a blur.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.606
Could we try something
like that?

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:50.436
Well, that's a nice effect,

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:53.316
but it doesn't really
get us what we want.

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:54.796
About the only thing
that is clear

00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:56.206
in this image is the background,

00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:58.946
which is kind of
besides the point.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.846
So we observed people,

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:06.466
developers like yourselves
going to heroic efforts.

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.496
What they would do is they
would have a background picture

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:11.686
like this and they would create
an entirely blurred version

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:15.126
of it, which would then be
clipped and moved into position

00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:17.896
to cover up the elements that
you want to dismay as a blur.

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:19.486
And that's awful.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:25.166
I mean, it's amazing that you
did that but it's bad for us

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:25.906
that we did that to you.

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:29.846
So -- and there are
other problems with that.

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.566
We can't animate
those backgrounds.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:33.796
And it's difficult to
change the blur effects.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:36.356
Once we have made a choice, we
have to re-render everything.

00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:41.166
So we needed a better way,
and that is backdrop-filter.

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.676
Backdrop filter allows us

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:47.396
to specify these backdrop
effects entirely in CSS

00:05:47.396 --> 00:05:51.246
and it's been proposed
as a standard to the W3C

00:05:51.246 --> 00:05:53.256
and is undergoing that
process right now.

00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:55.396
Let's see how this
fits together.

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:58.206
So if we have an
element that we want

00:05:58.206 --> 00:05:59.666
to provide a backdrop
filter for,

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:04.016
WebKit will take the region
behind it and re-render it

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:05.726
in an off screen context.

00:06:06.656 --> 00:06:11.186
And while that's efficient,
rendering passes are costly,

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:14.296
and so we want to make sure
we don't over use them.

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:16.526
Once we have this
background context,

00:06:16.526 --> 00:06:18.376
we then apply the filter
to them, so we blur it,

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:21.846
we composite the front-end
content back on top of it,

00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:25.536
and then we can recomposite
the entire scene back together

00:06:25.536 --> 00:06:29.346
and you get this beautiful blur
effect, exactly what we wanted.

00:06:29.836 --> 00:06:32.086
And once we got the
blurs to work,

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.396
we realized that we
wanted the flexibility

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:36.666
to use any of the CSS filters.

00:06:36.876 --> 00:06:37.506
So we did.

00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:38.916
We made it so that
you can use any

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.856
of the CSS filters
in this effect.

00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:43.206
So we can invert colors.

00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:46.266
We can combine filters together.

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:48.026
So we can get a blur
and a grayscale

00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:49.276
to get an effect like this.

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:53.886
And most amazingly of
all, we can overlay this

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:55.396
on top of dynamic content.

00:06:55.716 --> 00:07:00.436
So this backdrop blur filter
that's one line of CSS can be

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:03.686
on top of a video,
which is amazing!

00:07:03.686 --> 00:07:07.336
I was so excited when we had
this working and I can't wait

00:07:07.336 --> 00:07:10.186
to see what you guys do
with it on your own sites.

00:07:11.536 --> 00:07:13.936
So let's shift gears
a little bit.

00:07:13.936 --> 00:07:16.586
Another area that we saw
some issues was in layout

00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:18.496
and rendering of
scrolling effects.

00:07:19.096 --> 00:07:25.146
You have probably seen this
great iTunes banner at the top.

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:27.926
And if you've ever tried
playing with it, you'll notice

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:31.916
that when you try to scroll
it, it moves in whole steps.

00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:35.386
You get an entire movie
title, movie brick,

00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:37.176
each time you make a movement.

00:07:37.676 --> 00:07:41.966
And our photos app in iOS
has a similar kind of effect.

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:45.656
Each time we look at a photo we
want to swipe to the next one,

00:07:45.656 --> 00:07:48.686
we move across an entire
photo, we don't show part

00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:49.966
of one photo and
part of another.

00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:53.916
This kind of interaction is
really great for image galleries

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:56.926
or other types of tiled
content like this.

00:07:57.376 --> 00:08:01.556
And so what we observe people
doing was writing complicated

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:03.276
JavaScript implementations
that take

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:04.866
over the scrolling operations.

00:08:05.216 --> 00:08:08.436
They'd effectively throw out
the browser's built-in smooth

00:08:08.436 --> 00:08:10.896
scrolling infrastructure,
and replace it

00:08:10.896 --> 00:08:15.656
with manual JavaScript that
did this frame by frame.

00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:18.826
And we know that that's a
significant performance penalty.

00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:21.466
One thing we found is that
you can't get smooth scrolling

00:08:21.886 --> 00:08:24.226
by running complicated
JavaScript on every frame

00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:25.526
of a scrolling effect.

00:08:26.716 --> 00:08:28.386
So we needed another
way to do this.

00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:31.216
And that's scroll snap points.

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:36.046
Scroll Snap Points are
a way to declare in CSS,

00:08:36.765 --> 00:08:40.806
regions of scrolling that
take over the animation

00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:44.576
of that scrolling curve, and
this is also a CSS standard.

00:08:47.636 --> 00:08:51.456
So imagine we have a viewport
of some kind, a box that we want

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:53.406
to look at a series
of album covers in.

00:08:53.926 --> 00:08:57.026
And so in this image, I
have the album covers kind

00:08:57.176 --> 00:08:58.566
of dim and off-screen.

00:08:58.966 --> 00:09:02.286
But I want to cycle
through them one at a time.

00:09:02.806 --> 00:09:04.956
And let's say that I know
that they have a thick size,

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:06.576
they are all 300
pixels, for example.

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:11.076
Every time I swipe on this
content, I would want the scroll

00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:14.706
to take me across, one
entire album cover.

00:09:18.816 --> 00:09:20.826
And we can specify this behavior

00:09:21.176 --> 00:09:23.506
in Scroll Snap Points using
the Scroll Snap Points

00:09:23.906 --> 00:09:25.806
x declaration.

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:28.806
And we tell it that we want
it to be marching along

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:31.956
in a 300-pixel interval
using the repeat function,

00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:33.516
with a 300-pixel argument.

00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:37.456
And this animation shows
kind of how this looks.

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:39.856
I make a gesture to swipe
through these images,

00:09:40.676 --> 00:09:42.656
we travel across
some number of them,

00:09:42.656 --> 00:09:45.496
depending on how strong my
gesture is, but as we --

00:09:45.766 --> 00:09:49.066
as the momentum slows us
down, and we come to a stop,

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:52.536
we always land on a
clean album boundary.

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:59.896
Now, in source code, that
effect requires two lines.

00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:04.106
We turn the feature on using
the Scroll Snap Type mandatory,

00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:09.006
and then we specify the
repeat 300 pixel declaration.

00:10:11.366 --> 00:10:13.906
So I did a capture
on a live site.

00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:17.916
You can see that as I'm swiping
across these, you get movement.

00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:21.836
And if I slightly pull off and
let go, the system scrolls back

00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:23.236
to the nearest scroll
snap point.

00:10:23.316 --> 00:10:25.646
So, like, they're rubber
banding back to that position.

00:10:26.016 --> 00:10:30.576
And you've probably already
figured this out from the name,

00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:33.646
but scroll snap points work
in both dimensions, x and y.

00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:38.426
So what I have shown you

00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:41.356
so far would already be
a pretty neat feature

00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:45.516
but it doesn't handle the case
of varying sizes of content

00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:46.526
in the scroll container.

00:10:47.666 --> 00:10:50.076
And so here, where I have
non-uniform elements,

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:52.616
even though I might
have a 300 pixel square,

00:10:52.996 --> 00:10:54.496
I also have a rectangular unit.

00:10:55.006 --> 00:10:59.706
That rectangular image
or content will not fit

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.206
in that 300 pixel boundary.

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:02.666
And so if I attempt
to do a scroll

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:05.156
with that set content,
it won't look right.

00:11:06.176 --> 00:11:11.176
And so scroll snap has a
way of dealing with this.

00:11:11.386 --> 00:11:14.736
If we take the scroll container
as this white box behind me,

00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:17.986
there's something called
the scroll snap destination

00:11:18.196 --> 00:11:22.546
and that's a position that
we will align our elements

00:11:22.596 --> 00:11:23.396
when scrolling.

00:11:23.946 --> 00:11:25.576
It defaults to the
upper left corner

00:11:25.756 --> 00:11:28.986
but we can position it using
standard CSS positioning syntax.

00:11:29.496 --> 00:11:33.726
The companion to the scroll
snap destination is the scroll

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:34.606
snap coordinate.

00:11:36.736 --> 00:11:38.536
These are positions on each

00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:40.886
of the elements inside
the scrolling container.

00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:43.806
And they are also defaulted
to the upper left corner.

00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:46.106
So we can tell the scroll --

00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:49.456
the WebKit that we want our
scroll snap coordinates to be

00:11:49.456 --> 00:11:52.226
in the center of each
element using this syntax,

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:54.536
and we can say that
we want the center

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:56.196
of the scrolling container

00:11:56.196 --> 00:11:58.126
to be our target
point, the destination.

00:11:58.616 --> 00:12:00.346
And when you put them together,

00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:04.226
when you perform a scroll
gesture, we land on a clean,

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:07.136
centered point on that box.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:12.596
And the code for that is no
more complicated than it was

00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:14.346
for the simple repeating
pixel case.

00:12:14.756 --> 00:12:16.926
We turn the feature
on, on the container,

00:12:16.926 --> 00:12:18.816
the scrolling container,
with mandatory,

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:21.926
and we position the
destination in the center

00:12:21.926 --> 00:12:22.976
of the scrolling container.

00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:26.216
And then we position
the coordinate

00:12:26.216 --> 00:12:27.226
on each of the elements.

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:29.126
And I created a class,
'photograph,' here, but,

00:12:29.126 --> 00:12:30.426
you know, you can do
whatever you want,

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:32.316
and position that in the center.

00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:36.966
And so this is a capture of what
that looks like on a website.

00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:41.626
And so with a series of images,
as I scroll through them,

00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:43.506
we always land with
something in the middle.

00:12:44.066 --> 00:12:49.156
And with an example, with a
demonstration of how this looks

00:12:49.156 --> 00:12:50.756
in practice, I will invite Chris

00:12:50.756 --> 00:12:53.796
up to give you an
amazing example of this.

00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:59.166
[Applause]

00:12:59.666 --> 00:13:00.396
>> CHRIS YOUNG-ZAWADA:
Thanks, Brent.

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:03.006
My name is Chris
Young-Zawada and I'm a developer

00:13:03.006 --> 00:13:04.166
on Apple's Interactive team.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.286
The interactive team at
Apple does a lot of work

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.376
around the company, and one

00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:09.226
of the things we do is
we're responsible for a lot

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.866
of the web content
you see on Apple.com.

00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:13.836
So I'm super excited to be here
today because I feel like a lot

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:15.566
of the features that Brent
has been showing off are going

00:13:15.566 --> 00:13:16.906
to be really great
for web developers

00:13:16.906 --> 00:13:18.296
and I'm really excited
to use them myself.

00:13:19.376 --> 00:13:24.916
So to get started what we put
together is a little web app

00:13:24.916 --> 00:13:27.316
here that shows off some of
these new features in WebKit.

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:30.396
And we have a photo
gallery laid out here

00:13:30.396 --> 00:13:31.566
that we can scroll up and down.

00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:32.526
And you can see that some

00:13:32.526 --> 00:13:34.226
of the photos are
different sizes than others.

00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:37.166
We can hover over one, and
when we click to open it,

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:39.866
it will open in this overlay
view, where we are able

00:13:39.866 --> 00:13:43.516
to scroll between the photos,
by going left and right,

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.266
and we can even choose
our favorites

00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:46.366
in the top right
by clicking here.

00:13:47.656 --> 00:13:48.416
Now this is pretty cool,

00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:50.226
but I feel like we could make
it a lot better using some

00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:51.316
of the new features in Webkit.

00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:54.496
So, to get started, I want
to focus on backdrop filters.

00:13:55.326 --> 00:13:58.016
If you notice at the top
of the application here,

00:13:58.016 --> 00:13:59.586
we have this fixed
navigation element

00:13:59.996 --> 00:14:02.166
and right now it's just
a solid black color

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:03.206
and it's fixed at the top.

00:14:03.636 --> 00:14:06.846
As we scroll up and down, the
content goes underneath it

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:10.356
and then goes into the Safari
tool bar where it gets blurred.

00:14:10.496 --> 00:14:11.176
That's pretty cool

00:14:11.176 --> 00:14:13.456
but we actually can make
it a lot more cohesive

00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:15.896
by adding a backdrop filter to
this element and making it feel

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:17.346
like it's much more
part of the UI.

00:14:17.346 --> 00:14:20.166
So I'm going to show
you how to do that.

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:22.386
Just so you guys know, I like
to use spaces a lot when I code,

00:14:22.386 --> 00:14:24.986
so I'm going to jump between
the UI here and the code,

00:14:24.986 --> 00:14:28.676
back and forth, quite a bit.

00:14:28.886 --> 00:14:31.396
Cool. So right now, I'm in
Xcode and I'm in a CSS file

00:14:31.396 --> 00:14:33.286
that we are going to start
appending some new code to.

00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:36.516
So to do that, I'm going
to start, and I'm going

00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:39.626
to paste a new navigation
declaration here

00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:42.916
which is targeting that
solid black navigation bar,

00:14:43.226 --> 00:14:44.786
and we are going to set
the background color

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:47.786
to be solid black
with 50% opacity.

00:14:48.506 --> 00:14:49.946
And then we are going
to add a backdrop filter

00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:50.886
with 10 pixels of blur.

00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:56.466
If we go back, we can
now see in just one line

00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:59.246
of code we have added
this amazing new way

00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:02.576
to blur the content behind
as you are scrolling.

00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:04.206
The text is still super clear

00:15:04.206 --> 00:15:06.586
and everything goes really
nicely into the Safari toolbar.

00:15:06.996 --> 00:15:08.126
I think this is awesome.

00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:12.976
Like, this is fantastic work
on the WebKit team, to do this.

00:15:13.176 --> 00:15:14.336
Awesome. So the next
thing I want

00:15:14.336 --> 00:15:17.056
to show you guys is
scroll snap points.

00:15:17.436 --> 00:15:19.036
And I think a really
good candidate

00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:21.226
for Scroll Snap points
is this overlay gallery.

00:15:22.116 --> 00:15:24.626
Remember, when we're
scrolling this left and right,

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:27.826
we can get left in places where
we might see through the content

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:29.996
and not exactly focus on
what we're looking at here.

00:15:30.906 --> 00:15:33.446
This is okay, but we can
definitely make it better

00:15:33.446 --> 00:15:35.056
and by focusing on the content

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.596
with Scroll Snap Points we
are always going to look

00:15:36.596 --> 00:15:37.596
at the photos we
want to look at.

00:15:38.456 --> 00:15:40.136
So I'm going to show you
how to do that as well.

00:15:40.136 --> 00:15:42.876
So if we go back to
the CSS, we are going

00:15:42.876 --> 00:15:45.926
to add a new declaration
on the overlay gallery

00:15:45.926 --> 00:15:48.216
where we are going to set the
scroll snap type to mandatory

00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:50.836
and we are going to set
Scroll Snap Points x to repeat

00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:52.346
at 100 viewport width.

00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:53.696
Each photo container
is this size,

00:15:53.696 --> 00:15:55.806
so everything should fit
really nicely when we go back

00:15:55.806 --> 00:15:56.686
and we scroll that element.

00:15:57.516 --> 00:16:04.946
If we refresh, we can now very
cleanly go between the photos

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:06.686
and WebKit has taken
control of the scrolling.

00:16:06.686 --> 00:16:08.996
So you'll see that
I can hit the edges

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:10.536
and everything will
bounce back into place.

00:16:11.106 --> 00:16:12.056
It's really nice.

00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:14.536
And as you guys know this would
take a lot of JavaScript to do

00:16:14.656 --> 00:16:17.326
without this feature, so I can't
wait to see what you guys do

00:16:17.326 --> 00:16:19.016
with it and I think it's
going to be really great.

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:23.656
Another thing that is
popular, as you guys know,

00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:25.956
is you oftentimes will use
JavaScript to append styles

00:16:25.956 --> 00:16:28.966
to elements and what would be
a really interesting use-case

00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:30.266
for that would be
on this overlay --

00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:32.086
on this masonry gallery here.

00:16:32.086 --> 00:16:34.196
As we are scrolling up and down,

00:16:34.196 --> 00:16:36.496
we actually generate
this grid in JavaScript.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:40.186
So we can change how many cells
we want on the x and y axis.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.376
So we don't really know ahead of
time how tall each one is going

00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:47.116
to be but we can actually
set a repeat value

00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:48.956
on Scroll Snap Points
in JavaScript to make it

00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:51.186
so as we're scrolling
this vertically,

00:16:51.526 --> 00:16:53.586
the nav bar will sit very
nicely with these elements,

00:16:53.586 --> 00:16:55.436
so you are always focusing
on what you are supposed to.

00:16:56.376 --> 00:16:59.796
So to do that, we are going to
jump into the JavaScript, here,

00:17:00.036 --> 00:17:01.646
and this is a new JS file.

00:17:02.176 --> 00:17:06.215
And we are going to extend our
masonry gallery constructor

00:17:06.306 --> 00:17:07.826
to a Snap Points
masonry gallery.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:10.136
We are going to, and
basically all we're going

00:17:10.136 --> 00:17:11.846
to do is we're going to add
a new method called set snap

00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:12.486
point styles.

00:17:13.076 --> 00:17:15.195
What this will do is we will
actually set the scroll snap

00:17:15.246 --> 00:17:17.915
type to mandatory, and it
will set the snap points

00:17:18.126 --> 00:17:22.506
on the y axis to repeat as tall
as each cell is in the y axis

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:25.776
and this is a variable that we
set inside of the constructor

00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:27.945
when we are running
this on instantiation.

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:31.376
The last thing we're going
to do is we are going

00:17:31.376 --> 00:17:33.816
to tell our JS file to use this
so, because we've extended it,

00:17:33.816 --> 00:17:35.576
we just have to put it
here and use that instead

00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:36.386
of the masonry gallery.

00:17:36.996 --> 00:17:39.616
And now when we refresh,
you'll notice

00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:42.666
that the nav bar sits very
nicely with these elements

00:17:42.986 --> 00:17:44.596
and we can throw it
and it will always land

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:48.476
in a really nice place where
it fits with the content.

00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:50.496
I think that's really
great, and with that,

00:17:50.496 --> 00:17:53.096
I want to give it back to Brent,
who is going to talk some more

00:17:53.096 --> 00:17:53.796
about layout and rendering.

00:17:53.796 --> 00:17:53.976
Thank you.

00:17:54.516 --> 00:17:59.246
[Applause]

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:00.066
>> BRENT FULGHAM: Thank you.

00:18:00.066 --> 00:18:00.896
That was amazing.

00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:08.046
So I just want to go
over a couple of things

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.636
about those features
we just talked about.

00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:11.886
Backdrop filters
are very efficient.

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:14.606
They are hardware accelerated,
but the rendering passes

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:18.046
that it causes to
trigger can be expensive.

00:18:18.046 --> 00:18:20.156
So we want to be
careful to measure

00:18:20.156 --> 00:18:22.126
and see how things
work on your own sites.

00:18:22.606 --> 00:18:26.736
Scroll Snap is great for page
content, for tile content,

00:18:27.036 --> 00:18:28.876
but you want to be careful
if you are doing any kind

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.096
of programmatic scrolling

00:18:30.436 --> 00:18:33.886
because the two features will
fight each other when trying

00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:34.716
to animate the scroll.

00:18:34.876 --> 00:18:35.936
So keep that in mind.

00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:41.246
And that wraps up the section on
layout and rendering features.

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:44.986
And now I would like to move
on to some JavaScript updates

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:46.236
that we worked on this year.

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:50.376
The JavaScript ES6
standard is fantastic

00:18:50.726 --> 00:18:53.146
and is moving JavaScript
forward in a number

00:18:53.146 --> 00:18:56.776
of exciting new ways, and Chris
alluded to some in his demo.

00:18:56.776 --> 00:19:00.866
I want to talk for
a moment about a few

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:03.956
of the exciting features that
we put together this year.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.316
Last year, in our session,
we talked about a number

00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:08.496
of features that were added

00:19:09.036 --> 00:19:10.626
and we haven't been
sitting around since then.

00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:13.816
We have expanded the ES6
support tremendously this year

00:19:14.256 --> 00:19:17.336
with a lot of stuff, symbol
objects, object out of sign,

00:19:17.436 --> 00:19:20.426
weak sets, but I am just going
to touch on a couple of things

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:21.846
that I think are
really, really useful.

00:19:22.406 --> 00:19:25.026
Let's start with my favorite.

00:19:25.886 --> 00:19:26.726
Template Literals.

00:19:27.426 --> 00:19:30.686
Now how many times have
you run into this problem

00:19:30.686 --> 00:19:31.996
where you have a set of --

00:19:32.386 --> 00:19:34.186
you are trying to
build a logging string

00:19:34.186 --> 00:19:36.686
or produce something for a
user, and you have a bunch

00:19:36.686 --> 00:19:38.026
of string chunks that you want

00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:39.996
to concatenate together,
and some objects.

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.886
And so you end up with something
like this old syntax example.

00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:46.506
And I have spent more time
than I care to admit looking

00:19:46.506 --> 00:19:48.386
for the missing concatenating
operator

00:19:48.386 --> 00:19:50.646
or the closing quote
sign that I forgot about.

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:53.176
And so I was super excited

00:19:53.476 --> 00:19:56.386
when ES6 introduced this
new template literal syntax,

00:19:57.126 --> 00:20:00.486
where we create strings,
special strings,

00:20:00.526 --> 00:20:02.926
using the backtick
character instead

00:20:02.926 --> 00:20:03.946
of a regular quote string.

00:20:04.056 --> 00:20:07.266
And when we do that,
anything inside of the string

00:20:07.726 --> 00:20:11.306
that is escaped with this dollar
sign curly brace syntax gets

00:20:11.306 --> 00:20:13.826
converted into string
representation automatically.

00:20:14.406 --> 00:20:18.046
And you can even do operations
inside the syntax, like,

00:20:18.326 --> 00:20:19.876
here I'm adding two
numbers together.

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:22.966
And so both of these
give us the same output,

00:20:23.396 --> 00:20:26.936
but I find that the second
one is so much easier to read,

00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:29.356
and I have jumped
wholeheartedly into this.

00:20:29.356 --> 00:20:31.666
Everything I write is
in this syntax now.

00:20:31.796 --> 00:20:35.036
I love it!

00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:39.586
Another neat shorthand that was
introduced this year is related

00:20:39.586 --> 00:20:41.056
to object literal creation.

00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:43.576
So you often have a
situation like this,

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:46.536
where we have a generator
function of some kind with a set

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.146
of argument names
that we want to use.

00:20:48.756 --> 00:20:51.756
And often those argument names
are actually the names we want

00:20:51.756 --> 00:20:54.316
to use for the new object
literals that we're creating

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:58.306
and so you send up with a silly
repetition of name, colon, name,

00:20:58.306 --> 00:21:00.076
and category, colon, category.

00:21:00.336 --> 00:21:02.216
And that's such a common idiom

00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:05.946
that the ES6 designers
introduced a shorthand for this,

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:10.006
where you can create an
object literal with variables

00:21:10.146 --> 00:21:12.986
and if you don't supply the
property names it will just use

00:21:12.986 --> 00:21:15.166
the names of the values that
you are supplying to it.

00:21:15.636 --> 00:21:18.686
We were able to get rid of
a couple of hundred cases

00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:21.386
of this kind of duplication
in the web inspector,

00:21:22.136 --> 00:21:24.286
and found that to
be quite useful.

00:21:24.286 --> 00:21:26.086
And I'm sure that if you
look into your own code,

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:28.326
you will find plenty of
cases where this is helpful.

00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:34.856
Now, JavaScript has always had
strong object-oriented software

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:38.556
design features but it's
prototype based syntax has

00:21:38.556 --> 00:21:43.106
seemed, has been somewhat less
accessible for people coming

00:21:43.106 --> 00:21:45.746
to JavaScript from
languages like Swift or C++

00:21:45.746 --> 00:21:48.486
or other class-based
syntax languages.

00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:52.466
So here I have a simple example
of a polygon class written

00:21:52.606 --> 00:21:54.316
in the standard prototype
syntax.

00:21:55.016 --> 00:21:59.996
But in ES6, a new syntax has
been introduced, an object,

00:21:59.996 --> 00:22:03.456
a class-based syntax that
looks very familiar to anyone

00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:07.816
who comes from a language like
C++ or swift, and allows us

00:22:07.816 --> 00:22:09.466
to encapsulate everything
together.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:12.376
It's so much easier to
read and easier to see

00:22:12.376 --> 00:22:13.826
where things relate
to each other.

00:22:15.086 --> 00:22:19.316
The class syntax includes a
special function, a constructor,

00:22:19.766 --> 00:22:22.246
that handles the object
initialization for us,

00:22:22.956 --> 00:22:24.896
and we can define
methods in the class

00:22:24.986 --> 00:22:26.406
that are part of the object.

00:22:26.856 --> 00:22:29.736
And it supports inheritance.

00:22:29.736 --> 00:22:32.306
So we can inherit using
the extends keyword

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.456
from existing objects.

00:22:34.476 --> 00:22:36.326
When we inherit, we
want to make sure

00:22:36.326 --> 00:22:39.676
that we initialize the parent
class using the super operator.

00:22:41.016 --> 00:22:43.096
We can override methods
like you would expect

00:22:43.096 --> 00:22:44.926
from other object-oriented
languages,

00:22:45.286 --> 00:22:47.616
and it even supports
static methods now,

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:50.246
so you can define
methods on the class

00:22:50.246 --> 00:22:53.566
that you don't need a specific
instance of the object to use.

00:22:54.656 --> 00:22:59.386
And finally, this new class
syntax is completely compatible

00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.546
with the existing
prototype-based syntax.

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:05.576
So you can immediately start
extending prototype-based code

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:08.156
using this new syntax without
having to rewrite anything.

00:23:08.376 --> 00:23:11.206
I think that's a huge
advantage and it's something

00:23:11.206 --> 00:23:12.546
that you can start
using right away.

00:23:14.206 --> 00:23:18.846
So that was the brief overview
of some JavaScript updates.

00:23:19.096 --> 00:23:22.356
We have a ton more JavaScript
things that we did this year,

00:23:22.616 --> 00:23:26.296
so I really recommend you
get the El Capitan developer

00:23:26.296 --> 00:23:30.496
software and try it out.

00:23:31.356 --> 00:23:34.016
Now, as we've dealt with CSS
for many years we have run

00:23:34.016 --> 00:23:40.816
across a number of patterns that
lead to bloated style rules.

00:23:40.996 --> 00:23:44.636
And so this year, we implemented
a number of new CSS standards

00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:47.556
that are aimed at combatting
that, making styles simpler

00:23:47.556 --> 00:23:48.406
and easier to maintain.

00:23:48.976 --> 00:23:52.756
It's a recurring theme in this
talk, but I don't have time

00:23:52.756 --> 00:23:55.526
to get into all the things
we did this year, any-link,

00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:59.336
placeholder-shown, lang,
just a bunch of improvements,

00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:02.316
but I do hope that you get our
developer seed and try it out.

00:24:02.366 --> 00:24:05.766
So I want to talk first

00:24:05.766 --> 00:24:08.336
about some recently unprefixed
properties and values.

00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:12.036
We became satisfied with
the standards compliance

00:24:12.036 --> 00:24:13.976
and stability of a number
of features this year,

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:15.636
and so we've unprefixed them.

00:24:15.636 --> 00:24:17.756
So now you can use them
in their native format.

00:24:18.106 --> 00:24:21.036
We will continue to support
the WebKit prefixed version

00:24:21.036 --> 00:24:23.216
of these, so your existing
sites will continue to work.

00:24:23.496 --> 00:24:25.856
We recommend that you
switch to the new WebKit,

00:24:26.566 --> 00:24:30.386
or the WebKit less version of
these strings in your new code.

00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:35.016
Now, I know it's going
to be hard to top

00:24:35.016 --> 00:24:36.936
that exciting unprefixing slide.

00:24:36.936 --> 00:24:38.366
But I am going to try.

00:24:40.376 --> 00:24:44.276
A very common need is
the ability to recognize

00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:46.356
when your site is
being used in a browser

00:24:46.356 --> 00:24:48.016
that supports specific features.

00:24:48.276 --> 00:24:50.306
And so you may choose
to use certain features

00:24:50.306 --> 00:24:52.336
or not depending on
what the browser can do.

00:24:52.806 --> 00:24:58.776
Let's say, for example, I
have a website where I want

00:24:58.776 --> 00:25:02.366
to use a neat drop cap style,
and so to achieve this look,

00:25:02.466 --> 00:25:05.366
I want to use a different
font for that "C."

00:25:05.636 --> 00:25:09.496
I want to add spacing and
extra padding around it.

00:25:09.496 --> 00:25:11.206
I want it to be a different size

00:25:11.806 --> 00:25:14.226
so that it's visually
distinctive.

00:25:14.606 --> 00:25:16.736
And I can do that using
WebKit initial letter,

00:25:16.736 --> 00:25:19.206
which is another new
feature this year in WebKit.

00:25:19.726 --> 00:25:24.946
But if the browser viewing
my site doesn't support this,

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:30.236
we get this awful --
I mean this is gross!

00:25:30.516 --> 00:25:32.736
I would never have used this
font if I knew it was going

00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:33.676
to end up looking like this.

00:25:33.676 --> 00:25:35.656
I wouldn't have put
the spacing around it,

00:25:35.906 --> 00:25:37.106
if I knew it was
not going to fit

00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:38.576
in this with idea that I had.

00:25:38.576 --> 00:25:40.536
I would rather have
done nothing at all.

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:46.056
And so in the past, we would
use code that looks something

00:25:46.056 --> 00:25:48.806
like this, to probe the
browser and say, hey,

00:25:48.806 --> 00:25:50.246
do you support initial style?

00:25:50.246 --> 00:25:52.646
And if you do, then I
can do some extra work,

00:25:52.646 --> 00:25:54.806
navigate the dom, find
the elements that I want

00:25:54.806 --> 00:25:56.836
to style, turn these things on.

00:25:56.836 --> 00:25:59.976
Well, that's a lot of
JavaScript to run or a lot

00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:02.506
of libraries to import
to do that.

00:26:03.606 --> 00:26:05.096
And now we don't have to.

00:26:05.686 --> 00:26:09.216
WebKit supports the
@supports function this year,

00:26:09.676 --> 00:26:11.346
which allows us to
create a conditional

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:15.446
where everything inside the
brackets is applied only

00:26:15.446 --> 00:26:16.666
if the conditional is true.

00:26:16.666 --> 00:26:19.466
So in this case where I
have WebKit initial letter,

00:26:19.806 --> 00:26:22.516
I can have all my
special styling inside the

00:26:22.516 --> 00:26:24.676
supports clause.

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:27.326
And so if I go to that
site with a browser

00:26:27.326 --> 00:26:30.926
that doesn't support WebKit
initial letter, I get a,

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:37.656
you know, blander view of
things, but it's perfectly fine.

00:26:37.656 --> 00:26:39.986
This is legible and
it looks good.

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:42.786
But if someone goes to
the site with Safari,

00:26:43.296 --> 00:26:45.746
they get this glorious drop cap.

00:26:46.696 --> 00:26:53.166
Amazing! I want to talk a little
bit about reducing repetition.

00:26:54.636 --> 00:26:57.076
This is some actual code
from the web inspector.

00:26:57.536 --> 00:27:00.476
Well, I cleaned it up a
little bit for the slide,

00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:03.466
but we have lots of cases where
we have something like this,

00:27:03.866 --> 00:27:08.016
defaults and a bunch of
classes that are part of --

00:27:08.016 --> 00:27:09.196
are part of that same group,

00:27:09.376 --> 00:27:13.496
and we want to apply
some styling to them.

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:16.286
But we're repeating
defaults over and over again,

00:27:16.286 --> 00:27:19.666
and you multiply this times
dozens of other classes

00:27:19.666 --> 00:27:22.596
and hundreds of other styles
that we are trying to achieve

00:27:23.026 --> 00:27:25.666
and it ends up being a
lot of stuff to maintain.

00:27:26.966 --> 00:27:31.056
And so the CSS 4
designers agreed

00:27:31.056 --> 00:27:33.876
and created the matches
pseudo-class.

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.146
And what this does
is it allows us

00:27:37.696 --> 00:27:42.406
to programmatically
define all the permutations

00:27:42.406 --> 00:27:47.066
between default, for example, a
class, and a list of selectors.

00:27:47.816 --> 00:27:49.196
And this takes the place

00:27:49.196 --> 00:27:51.376
of those repeated
lines of common stuff.

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:54.226
Replaces it with one line.

00:27:55.236 --> 00:27:57.516
And, so, about the only
thing I like better

00:27:57.516 --> 00:27:59.366
than writing code
is deleting it.

00:27:59.456 --> 00:28:01.356
And so this is fantastic!

00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:05.186
Because we can get rid of tons
and tons of replicated code.

00:28:05.186 --> 00:28:07.406
This was a great day in the
web inspector when we were able

00:28:07.406 --> 00:28:09.886
to land these changes and get
rid of all this duplication.

00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:15.776
And so those were some new
CSS features this year.

00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:19.046
And that also completes
our discussion

00:28:19.046 --> 00:28:20.696
about enhancements in Safari.

00:28:20.696 --> 00:28:25.726
So now I want to shift gears
a little bit and talk a bit

00:28:25.726 --> 00:28:29.116
about creating amazing
experiences on OS X and iOS.

00:28:29.976 --> 00:28:33.346
How many of you here have sites

00:28:33.346 --> 00:28:36.336
that are targeted
just for desktop?

00:28:36.906 --> 00:28:38.706
Or you have special things
that are just for desktop?

00:28:39.196 --> 00:28:39.796
One or two.

00:28:40.556 --> 00:28:43.746
And others that might have stuff
that's specific for mobile,

00:28:43.826 --> 00:28:45.176
right, iOS and Safari.

00:28:46.396 --> 00:28:51.926
And so while the bulk of my
talk is aimed at convincing you

00:28:51.926 --> 00:28:53.766
to use some of these
web standard features

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:56.826
that have been developed,
in this part of the talk,

00:28:56.826 --> 00:28:59.266
I'm hoping to convince you
to adopt a few of the things

00:28:59.706 --> 00:29:01.796
that are unique to Mac and iOS.

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:05.656
And by supporting these
technologies, you can surprise

00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:08.256
and delight your users and
extend their engagement

00:29:08.256 --> 00:29:11.226
with your content across
our entire ecosystem.

00:29:13.626 --> 00:29:17.186
AirPlay has been around on iOS
since iOS 4 and we've supported

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:19.636
that in Safari since iOS 4.

00:29:20.166 --> 00:29:25.016
But this year, we opened
up AirPlay on Safari,

00:29:25.166 --> 00:29:29.976
on OS X which allows your
users to play your media

00:29:30.816 --> 00:29:34.006
to Apple TV directly
from the device.

00:29:34.456 --> 00:29:38.196
The API is identical to the
one that was produced for iOS.

00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:40.146
So if you did the work
to support it back

00:29:40.146 --> 00:29:42.256
in 2013, you are done!

00:29:42.456 --> 00:29:45.606
Or if you use our
media controls,

00:29:46.106 --> 00:29:47.206
you have that support now.

00:29:47.626 --> 00:29:51.066
But if you haven't, I
recommend that you look

00:29:51.066 --> 00:29:54.606
at our WWDC 2013 talk where we
go into some detail about how

00:29:54.606 --> 00:29:56.106
to support the AirPlay protocol.

00:30:00.176 --> 00:30:01.486
Multitasking.

00:30:01.486 --> 00:30:04.456
Wasn't it cool to see
multitasking on iPad yesterday?

00:30:06.586 --> 00:30:08.956
Until yesterday you
had a pretty good idea

00:30:08.956 --> 00:30:11.426
that when you viewed content
on an iPad, you had a good idea

00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:12.236
of what you were getting.

00:30:12.656 --> 00:30:14.246
You pretty much had
the entire screen.

00:30:14.456 --> 00:30:17.936
But now you can have two-thirds
of the screen allocated

00:30:17.936 --> 00:30:24.156
to your content, or
half, or a third.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:27.626
And so responsive design
is really important now.

00:30:28.436 --> 00:30:31.116
Users control the
size of the view,

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:34.476
and iPad is a lot
more like desktop now.

00:30:35.056 --> 00:30:39.466
It's so important, responsive
design is so important,

00:30:39.466 --> 00:30:44.386
that we have an entire session
tomorrow, same time, same place.

00:30:45.036 --> 00:30:46.996
I know you all are capable
of getting up in the morning

00:30:46.996 --> 00:30:49.976
because you are here today,
and I recommend you come

00:30:49.976 --> 00:30:51.776
and see "Using Safari to Deliver

00:30:51.776 --> 00:30:53.716
and Debug a Responsive
Web Design" tomorrow,

00:30:53.716 --> 00:30:56.096
which goes into the tools and
features that have been added

00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:59.786
to the web inspector in Safari
to make your life easier

00:30:59.786 --> 00:31:01.596
when trying to support
these styles.

00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:04.256
There's also a session
on multitasking

00:31:04.436 --> 00:31:08.236
for media-based apps on iPad and
iOS 9 which is also of interest.

00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:13.366
And we talked about
picture-in-picture yesterday.

00:31:13.936 --> 00:31:18.406
The iPad has always been a
great way to view content,

00:31:19.296 --> 00:31:22.056
and until yesterday,
you had a good idea

00:31:22.056 --> 00:31:24.286
that your content
would be consumed

00:31:24.286 --> 00:31:25.776
in this sort of full
screen form.

00:31:26.826 --> 00:31:27.866
But now we have a new way.

00:31:27.866 --> 00:31:30.446
We have picture-in-picture
which allows you

00:31:30.446 --> 00:31:34.276
to compress your pictures of
your children into a small box

00:31:34.276 --> 00:31:36.636
in the corner of your
giant empty calendar.

00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:43.466
But it's a great feature.

00:31:43.636 --> 00:31:47.776
We have -- we defined this in
WebKit as presentation mode.

00:31:47.776 --> 00:31:50.106
We support full screen,
which you are familiar with.

00:31:50.606 --> 00:31:55.236
And inline in which your content
is displayed in the page itself,

00:31:55.556 --> 00:31:59.136
and picture-in-picture,
which is our new style.

00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:03.766
So we have a range of sizes that
you need to be worried about.

00:32:05.696 --> 00:32:08.426
The WebKit, default WebKit
Media Controls support

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.896
picture-in-picture
out of the box,

00:32:10.766 --> 00:32:12.596
but if you write your
own media controls,

00:32:12.596 --> 00:32:14.746
you need to use the
presentation mode API

00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:15.896
to control these things.

00:32:16.396 --> 00:32:19.966
And our developer documentation
has information on how

00:32:19.966 --> 00:32:22.836
to take advantage of
that in your own content.

00:32:23.206 --> 00:32:25.526
There are a few things for
you to be thinking about here.

00:32:26.516 --> 00:32:30.376
When a viewer starts
viewing your content

00:32:30.376 --> 00:32:32.366
in full screen video display,

00:32:32.616 --> 00:32:34.426
the page may not
be obscured anymore

00:32:34.426 --> 00:32:37.486
because the viewer can exit
full screen mode and go

00:32:37.486 --> 00:32:39.896
into picture-in-picture without
you really knowing about it.

00:32:40.096 --> 00:32:42.826
So if you take the opportunity
to turn certain features off

00:32:42.826 --> 00:32:45.026
or hide content on your
page while a video is being

00:32:45.026 --> 00:32:47.966
displayed, that may not
look right if they are going

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:48.746
to picture-in-picture.

00:32:49.016 --> 00:32:52.056
And since the media may be
playing in a very small window,

00:32:52.386 --> 00:32:55.756
we strongly recommend that
use HTTP Live Streaming,

00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:58.616
or HLS, for delivering media.

00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:03.546
HLS allows our media engine
to select a bit encoding,

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:06.696
a bit rate for the video
that matches the size

00:33:06.696 --> 00:33:08.066
of the content being displayed.

00:33:08.376 --> 00:33:10.566
It also takes into
effect, network conditions,

00:33:10.566 --> 00:33:12.286
battery status on the device.

00:33:12.706 --> 00:33:15.256
And so by using it,
you will ensure

00:33:15.256 --> 00:33:19.216
that your user has
the best experience

00:33:19.216 --> 00:33:22.136
because it will take care of a
lot of those details for them.

00:33:23.356 --> 00:33:26.206
Multitasking essentials for
media based apps on iPad

00:33:26.456 --> 00:33:28.626
in iOS 9 is a great
session to see on Wednesday.

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:31.766
And if you haven't heard
enough from me this year,

00:33:31.766 --> 00:33:34.476
you can see me and Jer
talking about advanced media

00:33:34.476 --> 00:33:37.866
for the web last year, where we
went into some detail about HLS.

00:33:38.626 --> 00:33:41.716
So finally, I want to talk
about something really amazing,

00:33:42.016 --> 00:33:43.466
our Force Touch trackpad.

00:33:44.816 --> 00:33:47.366
back in March we were excited
to show off our new products

00:33:47.366 --> 00:33:49.236
with this great new hardware.

00:33:49.756 --> 00:33:52.956
It allows us to recognize
a second level of click,

00:33:53.056 --> 00:33:55.456
we call Force Click, and we
are really excited about this.

00:33:55.976 --> 00:34:01.786
We had a lot of fun adding
new user interface features

00:34:01.786 --> 00:34:05.286
like this mode of dictionary
look up that allows us to find

00:34:05.286 --> 00:34:06.886
out what a fluoroelastomer
really is.

00:34:07.516 --> 00:34:11.116
And we added a way to view
the content behind a link

00:34:11.116 --> 00:34:12.786
without having to
leave the web page.

00:34:13.206 --> 00:34:15.766
I know that all of you can
come up with even better ways

00:34:15.766 --> 00:34:18.545
to make use of this
hardware in a web context.

00:34:18.545 --> 00:34:21.295
And so we wanted to open
up access to that hardware

00:34:21.295 --> 00:34:22.886
so that you could
use it yourselves

00:34:22.886 --> 00:34:23.946
in your own web pages.

00:34:24.426 --> 00:34:27.815
Let me talk briefly about
how this fits together.

00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:31.266
When we have a normal
Trackpad, if the user presses

00:34:31.266 --> 00:34:33.835
down we eventually
reach a level of force

00:34:33.976 --> 00:34:36.356
that we consider
to be mouse down.

00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:40.396
And as the user continues
to press, and then lets up,

00:34:40.676 --> 00:34:43.136
we come back through
that pressure level

00:34:43.346 --> 00:34:46.746
and call it mouse up, and
we issue it a click event.

00:34:47.616 --> 00:34:52.255
We extended this model to
support Force Click operations

00:34:52.585 --> 00:34:55.795
by adding a WebKit force
property to all mouse events,

00:34:55.795 --> 00:34:57.596
which tells you how much
force is being applied

00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:58.126
to the Trackpad.

00:34:58.126 --> 00:35:01.986
And then we also added
a number of new events

00:35:01.986 --> 00:35:04.656
that you can register
for, to handle this.

00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:08.276
So if we go back
to this last slide

00:35:08.276 --> 00:35:10.186
where we had mouse
up, mouse down.

00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:13.396
We now emit a mouse
force will begin event.

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:16.356
And that's a great opportunity
to call prevent defaults

00:35:16.356 --> 00:35:18.876
on the event itself
to prevent us

00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:21.106
from calling the
dictionary look up logic

00:35:21.106 --> 00:35:22.516
or from doing the link preview,

00:35:22.546 --> 00:35:23.926
if you want to take
over this yourself.

00:35:24.346 --> 00:35:28.806
After passing through
the mouse down phase,

00:35:28.806 --> 00:35:32.136
if the user continues to press,
we hit a second level of force

00:35:32.136 --> 00:35:34.276
that we consider
to be a force click

00:35:34.276 --> 00:35:36.206
and we emit a mouse
force down event.

00:35:36.586 --> 00:35:40.396
And as the user lets
up on the force,

00:35:40.396 --> 00:35:42.056
we pass through a
mouse force up.

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:45.226
So it's completely analogous
to mouse up, mouse down,

00:35:45.226 --> 00:35:47.946
we have mouse force
down, mouse force up.

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:53.086
And during the entire phase
of time, between mouse down

00:35:53.296 --> 00:35:56.456
and mouse up, we emit
mouse force changed events

00:35:56.456 --> 00:35:59.986
and we do this because the
user may be changing pressure,

00:36:00.226 --> 00:36:01.996
changing the amount
of force they apply

00:36:02.476 --> 00:36:04.096
without moving their
finger around.

00:36:04.096 --> 00:36:06.136
So there would be
no mouse move event

00:36:06.136 --> 00:36:07.526
to capture that force for you.

00:36:08.836 --> 00:36:13.316
And note, we also define
two layers, two constants

00:36:13.316 --> 00:36:14.996
that define the level of force

00:36:14.996 --> 00:36:17.276
at a regular click
and a Force Click.

00:36:17.276 --> 00:36:19.996
And we strongly recommend you
use these constants instead

00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:23.006
of capturing numeric values
because those may change

00:36:23.316 --> 00:36:25.396
as the specification matures.

00:36:26.496 --> 00:36:29.476
And so to show us how to
take advantage of this

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:32.246
in your own website, I would
like to invite Chris back

00:36:33.146 --> 00:36:34.046
to show us another demo.

00:36:35.516 --> 00:36:38.586
[Applause]

00:36:39.086 --> 00:36:39.326
>> CHRIS YOUNG-ZAWADA: Great.

00:36:40.606 --> 00:36:41.066
Thanks, Brent.

00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:44.546
So as Brent just told us about
Force Touch, there's a lot

00:36:44.546 --> 00:36:45.896
of really cool things
you can do with it

00:36:45.896 --> 00:36:47.366
that can really enhance
your websites.

00:36:47.746 --> 00:36:49.206
And if you guys remember
when we were looking

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:52.996
at the demo earlier, when we
were clicking into this overlay,

00:36:52.996 --> 00:36:54.986
we had the ability to
choose our favorite photos.

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:58.156
That's really easy to do,
but it's also another step

00:36:58.156 --> 00:37:00.466
and I think if we can really
make it better for users

00:37:00.466 --> 00:37:03.206
that have a Force Touch
trackpad in case we want

00:37:03.206 --> 00:37:05.676
to make a little bit more
interactivity for them.

00:37:07.036 --> 00:37:10.256
So while I was offstage,
I actually made a couple

00:37:10.256 --> 00:37:12.506
of changes to the code and what
I have done is I've actually

00:37:12.506 --> 00:37:14.426
extended the Snap
Points masonry gallery

00:37:14.426 --> 00:37:16.716
to create a force enhanced
masonry gallery and we are going

00:37:16.716 --> 00:37:18.226
to use this to add
some force events,

00:37:18.396 --> 00:37:21.166
and actually do some
animation on force change.

00:37:21.946 --> 00:37:23.556
So there's a couple of
things to point out here.

00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:25.666
The most important thing is we
are going to get the min force

00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.916
and max force values from
the mouse event data,

00:37:27.916 --> 00:37:31.386
which are the force at mouse
down and force at force mouse

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:33.746
down contstants that
Brent just told us about.

00:37:34.146 --> 00:37:35.786
The other thing we are
going to do is we're going

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:40.406
to bind some event listeners for
the force events that get thrown

00:37:40.406 --> 00:37:43.626
so we can actually bind to
them and make updates on those.

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:46.276
I've just stepped out how we
are going to handle those,

00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:47.336
so it doesn't do
anything right now.

00:37:47.336 --> 00:37:48.536
So we are going to
go step by step.

00:37:50.216 --> 00:37:52.006
Cool. So to get started, I
am actually going to start

00:37:52.006 --> 00:37:53.076
with force mouse down.

00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:55.246
And what we are going to do
in this case, is we are going

00:37:55.326 --> 00:37:56.796
to run this function
I have written,

00:37:56.796 --> 00:37:58.636
called set within
force range of true,

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:01.696
and all this really does is
put a CSS property in the page

00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:04.336
that makes sure that our CSS
transitions don't interfere

00:38:04.336 --> 00:38:06.996
with our own animations in
JavaScript, because we are going

00:38:06.996 --> 00:38:09.026
to be getting a lot of force
data with force change events.

00:38:09.026 --> 00:38:10.166
We don't want those
to interfere.

00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:11.216
So this basically makes sure

00:38:11.216 --> 00:38:13.306
that the transitions is
set in a lot of things.

00:38:14.346 --> 00:38:16.486
The next thing we are
going to do is look

00:38:16.486 --> 00:38:17.946
at what kit mouse force changed.

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:20.776
And we do a few things here.

00:38:20.776 --> 00:38:22.216
We are actually getting
the force data

00:38:22.616 --> 00:38:24.586
from the WebKit force
property of the event.

00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:26.546
And we are going to create
a progress, and we are going

00:38:26.546 --> 00:38:28.266
to see how far along
between the min force

00:38:28.266 --> 00:38:29.466
and the max force values we are.

00:38:29.906 --> 00:38:32.066
And we're actually going
to animate some elements

00:38:32.106 --> 00:38:34.366
between those, so you'll see
that we are going to go back

00:38:34.366 --> 00:38:35.586
and do some interesting
things there.

00:38:36.516 --> 00:38:37.546
And basically when we are

00:38:37.546 --> 00:38:39.026
through our progress
we are going to say

00:38:39.026 --> 00:38:40.576
that we favorited the image
and we are going to say

00:38:40.576 --> 00:38:41.326
that we are done animating.

00:38:41.946 --> 00:38:44.686
So if we go back and refresh.

00:38:45.566 --> 00:38:48.046
If you hover over this photo you
can see that now as I press up

00:38:48.046 --> 00:38:50.376
and down, we are actually
scaling the image depending

00:38:50.376 --> 00:38:52.376
on the pressure that I'm
applying to the force trackpad.

00:38:52.916 --> 00:38:54.916
It's really cool and
it's really interactive

00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:56.256
and it adds a whole
new layer of depth.

00:38:57.226 --> 00:38:58.596
When I press all the
way down, you will see

00:38:58.596 --> 00:39:01.026
that this heart appears which
means we've liked the photo,

00:39:01.026 --> 00:39:02.696
but I'm actually still
holding my finger down.

00:39:02.696 --> 00:39:05.586
So as I pull it up,
you will see that we go

00:39:05.586 --> 00:39:06.586
into this overlay view.

00:39:06.836 --> 00:39:08.636
And that might not
be what we want.

00:39:08.636 --> 00:39:11.046
What's happening is that the
click event is still being fired

00:39:11.046 --> 00:39:12.406
because we haven't prevented any

00:39:12.406 --> 00:39:13.886
of the default behavior
in the browser.

00:39:13.986 --> 00:39:16.226
So to do that, we
actually just go back

00:39:16.226 --> 00:39:17.276
and add a quick line of code.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:21.076
And we're going to go to
'mouse force will begin'

00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:23.276
and we are basically just
going to call prevent default.

00:39:23.276 --> 00:39:24.616
This is going to
make sure that none

00:39:24.616 --> 00:39:27.036
of the OS interactions
interfere with what you

00:39:27.036 --> 00:39:29.676
as developers are doing
and you get full control.

00:39:30.726 --> 00:39:33.476
So if we go back, we can
try it one more time,

00:39:33.476 --> 00:39:37.326
and after we hit this level,
nothing is going to happen.

00:39:37.326 --> 00:39:38.756
But we still have
to reset everything.

00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:40.786
So to do that, we have to
remove the styles we've set

00:39:40.786 --> 00:39:42.286
with JavaScript and make sure

00:39:42.286 --> 00:39:43.526
that everything runs
really smoothly.

00:39:44.376 --> 00:39:49.086
So we can just fill that
in with mouse force up.

00:39:49.546 --> 00:39:50.996
And all we are doing
here is removing a lot

00:39:50.996 --> 00:39:53.246
of the styles we set
and making sure that all

00:39:53.246 --> 00:39:55.946
of the CSS properties we put in
there get removed and go back

00:39:55.946 --> 00:39:58.186
to normal as if we never
touched this at all.

00:39:58.716 --> 00:40:02.306
Great. So with this new
interaction we can hover

00:40:02.306 --> 00:40:06.266
over the photos, get that
animation, like them,

00:40:06.866 --> 00:40:11.126
and just like that, we have got
the ability to add favorites

00:40:11.126 --> 00:40:13.116
to our photos and we can still
just do a regular click to go

00:40:13.116 --> 00:40:14.176
to the gallery any time.

00:40:14.606 --> 00:40:16.966
I think this is really
cool and I'm really excited

00:40:16.966 --> 00:40:18.646
to see what you guys are going
to do with this new technology.

00:40:19.186 --> 00:40:20.776
And with that, I am going
to give it back to Brent.

00:40:20.776 --> 00:40:20.956
Thank you.

00:40:21.516 --> 00:40:26.276
[Applause]

00:40:26.776 --> 00:40:27.336
>> BRENT FULGHAM: Thanks, Chris.

00:40:28.786 --> 00:40:31.676
So I think you will agree
that that was a great way

00:40:31.676 --> 00:40:32.826
to make use of this hardware.

00:40:33.426 --> 00:40:37.466
A couple of best practices
for the Force Touch trackpad

00:40:37.466 --> 00:40:38.966
that I would like to recommend.

00:40:39.676 --> 00:40:41.776
Always use the mouse
force constants

00:40:41.886 --> 00:40:45.006
and not hardcoded numerical
values, because we expect

00:40:45.006 --> 00:40:48.756
that these may change as
we navigate the process

00:40:48.966 --> 00:40:52.476
of fulfilling or
completing this feature.

00:40:53.136 --> 00:40:56.146
And remember that not all users
have Force Touch hardware,

00:40:56.146 --> 00:41:01.786
sadly, and so we should use this
as a shortcut or as a flourish,

00:41:01.786 --> 00:41:03.866
an extra for people
who have this hardware.

00:41:04.166 --> 00:41:07.336
Use it to drive animations or
to provide a shortcut to content

00:41:07.336 --> 00:41:08.666
that you can get to other ways.

00:41:09.136 --> 00:41:14.706
And that was creating amazing
experiences on Mac and iOS.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:19.176
And that rounds out the
bulk of the talk today.

00:41:19.266 --> 00:41:21.196
I just want to summarize
a couple of things.

00:41:21.936 --> 00:41:24.366
We talked about backdrop
filters, an amazing way

00:41:24.366 --> 00:41:28.096
of hardware accelerated backdrop
filter effects on your sites.

00:41:28.466 --> 00:41:32.866
Scroll Snap Points allow
you to get tiled scrolling

00:41:32.866 --> 00:41:34.516
with just a few lines of CSS.

00:41:35.396 --> 00:41:38.656
We talked about the amazing
new class syntax in JavaScript,

00:41:39.406 --> 00:41:44.696
the @supports functions for CSS,
so that we can block out content

00:41:44.696 --> 00:41:46.316
and have styles that apply only

00:41:46.316 --> 00:41:47.846
when certain features
are available.

00:41:48.456 --> 00:41:52.216
We talked a bit about AirPlay
coming to OS X through Safari,

00:41:52.736 --> 00:41:56.376
and picture-in-picture and iOS
multitasking, and some sessions

00:41:56.376 --> 00:42:00.156
that you should see about that,
and this new Force Touch API.

00:42:01.276 --> 00:42:04.756
For more information,
documentation is available.

00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:06.216
We always love people to come

00:42:06.216 --> 00:42:09.726
to the WebKit project
at www.WebKit.org.

00:42:10.086 --> 00:42:12.636
Join us and see what we
are doing or come try

00:42:12.636 --> 00:42:14.916
out the nightlies and see
what new features are coming

00:42:14.916 --> 00:42:15.816
for next year.

00:42:15.816 --> 00:42:16.836
Get a sneak peek.

00:42:16.836 --> 00:42:20.446
And for general inquiries,
I recommend that you get

00:42:20.446 --> 00:42:22.546
to know Jonathan Davis,
our WebKit Evangelist.

00:42:22.546 --> 00:42:25.146
He's a great person to get
to know when you have issues

00:42:25.146 --> 00:42:28.576
that you want to talk about or
if you have messages you want

00:42:28.576 --> 00:42:30.076
to get to us on the WebKit team.

00:42:31.246 --> 00:42:34.016
And with that, thank you so
much for your time this morning

00:42:34.016 --> 00:42:35.966
and have a great time
at WWDC this week.

00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:38.031
[Applause]

00:42:38.046 --> 00:42:38.266
Thank you.
