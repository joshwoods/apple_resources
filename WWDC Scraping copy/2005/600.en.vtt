WEBVTT

00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.550
State of the Union.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.240
It's been one year since I last
stood up here and talked about how

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.380
Apple is doing in the enterprise.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.420
And boy, it's been an incredible year.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.170
We've had an increasing product
line aimed at the enterprise.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.540
We've had very aggressive adoption
by our partners and some great

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.820
feedback from our customers and
from the industry in general.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.320
To start out, I'd just like to give you
a little feel for that.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.020
Here's a quote from P.J.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.150
Conloy in InfoWorld.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.300
And this touches on a
very interesting subject.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.810
The combination of the cluster node
configuration and X-Grid clustering

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.310
software represents a revolution in how
IT looks at computers and builds systems.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.860
And if those of you
who remember last year,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.040
I mentioned that we were... We were going
to first see clustering in academia,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.760
but the very same things that
were driving clustering and

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.660
its use in research were going
to find their way into IT.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.840
And Apple jumped ahead of the
curve there and jumped right into

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.520
clustering in academia and science.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.290
And guess what?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.230
We're starting to see it in
the IT shops as we speak.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.310
I'll talk a little bit more
about that as we go on.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.780
Another quote from
Tom Yeager at InfoWorld.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.500
If you want a complete
productivity platform,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.600
you can nickel and dime
your way there with Windows.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.540
Actually,
I think nickels and dimes are probably

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.740
too small a denomination for that.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.310
You can hammer and saw
your way there with Linux.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.020
And for anyone who has deployed
Linux in the enterprise,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.350
I'm sure you know what I mean
by hammers and saws or what

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.580
Tom means by hammers and saws.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.540
Or you can hit the
ground running with OS X.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.770
And that is... That is really
the key differentiator.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.780
I mean, OS X, if you look at it,
is chock full of open source software,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.270
runs a lot of open source tools,
as you would in Linux.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.710
But the big difference is that Apple,
we take the responsibility

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.570
for integration,
for QA, for testing,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.300
for security updates.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.540
We give you a way to
hit the ground running,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.000
so it's kind of the best of both worlds.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.700
You get the support you would
get from a proprietary system,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.460
but the full power of taking
advantage of the world's ability

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.700
to create open source software
with all of that available on OS X.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.150
Just an incredibly increasing number
of enterprise customers over the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.200
last year actually in deployment.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.700
And we're going to actually hear
from some of those guys later today.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.880
They'll kind of take you through
their decision process and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.700
where they are in that process.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.590
I think you'll find
that very interesting.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.300
So, innovation.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.650
You heard about this
from Steve this morning.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.300
If Apple is anything,
Apple is an innovative company.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.080
I think we almost stand for
innovation in our industry.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.760
And you hear about innovation
a lot in terms of the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.330
consumer side of our business.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.500
So the iPod or the iTunes music
store and what we've done to

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.460
the music industry in general.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.370
Or iLife and the consumer
products that we make available.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.460
However, innovation also translates
into the world of IT.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.060
And in the world of IT,
it's not just innovation

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.460
around ease of use,
although that is important because

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.880
ease of use translates directly
into less calls to the help desk,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.410
etc.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.460
But innovation in the IT world also
translates into ease of deployment.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.460
Ease of management.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.460
Ultimately translates into
lower total cost of ownership.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.690
And that's where we focus our
innovation and our skills at

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.460
innovation in the IT world.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.460
Both in the software and in the hardware.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.750
Now, I'm a software guy,
so I'm going to spend a little bit of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.460
time talking about the software side.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.460
And innovation here is focused on OS X.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.460
And the latest OS X.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.550
The latest innovation there
is of course OS X Tiger.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:09:35.000
[Transcript missing]

00:09:35.600 --> 00:11:04.500
[Transcript missing]

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:10.200
Mac OS X Server, this is Tiger Server.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.480
What's new in Tiger Server?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.910
I'm going to actually go into this
in a little bit more detail later on,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.480
but just to mention the
key aspects that are new.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.020
64-bit applications,
that means 64-bit address space,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.520
so that you can go beyond
the 4-gigabyte barrier.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.400
ACLs or access control lists,
big deal in the enterprise.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.060
iChat server,
run your own instant messaging

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.920
inside the enterprise securely.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.070
Software update server,
it gives you control over when

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.720
systems get updated inside the
firewall or inside your enterprise.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.280
Weblog server,
weblogs are essentially the

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.520
groupware of the future.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.750
You're going to,
if you're not already running

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.740
them inside your company,
you're going to be running

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.680
them inside your company.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.020
We integrate a blog server
right in with Mac OS X Server.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.520
Junk mail and virus filtering,
which is a must for any mail system

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.200
that's deployed by an enterprise today,
and we have some very

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.160
good products there.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.350
Ethernet link aggregation,
that's sort of under the hood,

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.120
but I'll talk about that a bit.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.110
And then Xgrid,
taking advantage of those unused

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:28.190
CPU cycles around your corporation
to do high-performance computing.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:14:09.800
[Transcript missing]

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.100
I mentioned aggressive partner adoption.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.150
We've had a huge number of
IT and enterprise partners

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.640
come on over the last year.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.990
Just to mention a few, Oracle.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.580
We talked about Oracle 10G last year.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.760
Oracle 10G is now available.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.940
TIBCO, another partner that you're going
to hear a bit more about from

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.360
one of our customers later on.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.830
So this momentum continues.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.770
People now actually think of us
when they think of the IT space.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.320
They put us into their procurements
in terms of evaluation.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.940
I think this momentum is only
going to get stronger and continue.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:17:59.100
[Transcript missing]

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:06.350
Finally, or one more story that's of
interest and sort of centers

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:14.800
around not just 24/7 availability,
is the army.mil website.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.400
It's actually about 60 different
websites that the Army runs and these

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.400
are deployed on XSERVs and XSERV raids.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.400
The interesting thing about this is,
as you can imagine,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.400
these sites get attacked
occasionally by hackers.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.560
And they've been running
these sites on Mac OS X since,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:42.280
for about the last five years and
the result is no successful attacks.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.220
So not only do they have a site that
just stays up and keeps running,

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.370
but there have been no successful
hacker attacks on this site.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.400
The other interesting thing is that
they serve over a terabyte per day.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.400
This is not just a static website.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400
They actually make
heavy use of streaming.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.400
And Apple has a lot of great server-side
products for quick time streaming.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.400
That's part of their solution.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.320
And so this is a very heavy traffic site.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.000
It's a heavy amount of
bits streaming out of it,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.400
getting hacked all the time.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.400
It just keeps on running.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:31.170
So a great example of Macs being deployed
into a very mission-critical environment.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.050
This one is fun.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.960
This is UCLA physics and
astronomy department.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:43.290
These examples just keep coming up
of clusters getting deployed of max.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:49.660
Clusters of 64, 128, 256,
1024 clusters of max.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.400
It turns out to be just a great solution.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.680
In this case, they're using it,
they've got 256 dual processor

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:04.370
XSERVs and the result is they can
do 4 trillion double precision

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.050
floating point operations per second.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.560
They use this to do fusion research
at UCLA and one of the most fun things

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:19.010
whenever one of these gets deployed is,
especially in a university environment,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.780
is when everyone sort of gets
together to assemble the thing.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.380
And this is a very interesting example.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.860
And in this case,
they did some time lapse movies and put

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.500
together a little film showing it kind
of getting built from the ground up.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.950
And I thought I would just share
that with you because it's kind of a,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.410
it's fun to watch.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:57.700
[Transcript missing]

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:25.200
[Transcript missing]

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.020
I guess what I can say is
they're a federal contractor and

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.380
that's probably all I can say.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.160
But they have a need for large-scale,
high-performance computational

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.150
clusters for hypersonic research.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.220
And that's exactly what they do.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.640
They are currently the
largest Mac cluster.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:49.940
They have 1,566 dual processor,
2 gig G5 servers,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.480
backed up with XSERVs and XSAN systems.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.480
And they simulate hypersonic flight.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.420
I'm not sure exactly
what's going on here,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.820
but I think this is something
you don't actually want to have

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.060
happen during hypersonic flight.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:13.430
But another example of just the rate at
which cluster computing is catching on.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.370
So year in review, again,
a growing enterprise product line.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.550
Our product line continues
to grow both software,

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.720
hardware and support products.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.520
Aggressive partner adoption,
guys like the developers

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.290
who come to this conference
continuing to port to Mac OS X.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.960
And then finally,
some great customer feedback as they

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.590
begin to deploy into their environments.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.920
Now what I'd like to do is introduce
some real-life customers to give you,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.860
in their own words,
some of their experiences and where

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.220
they are in deploying Mac solutions.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.440
First of all,
I'd like to welcome Vijay Sonty,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.840
who's the Chief Information Officer for
Broward County School District.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.820
Now, you don't necessarily maybe think
of a school juristic as being

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.900
like a Fortune 500 CIO position.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.590
Vijay has extensive experience as CIO.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.440
He was named actually CIO of the new
century by Business 2.0 Magazine,

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.870
has managed multi-million
dollar projects.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.920
Broward County is like a
Fortune 500 enterprise deployment,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.030
and he's going to go
into some detail on that.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.210
So without further ado,
I'd like Vijay to come on up and

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.440
tell you about what they're doing.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:26:54.400
[Transcript missing]

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.720
Again, let's get started with some
very interesting facts.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.270
As you can see,
Broward is a very large organization.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.870
We are the sixth largest
school district in the US and

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:11.320
we have over 274,000 students,
an operating budget of $4.2

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.670
billion and 39,000 plus employees.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:20.100
So clearly,
it's the size of a very typical

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.550
Fortune 500 organization.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:27.020
So let's look at some other statistics
which present the education enterprise.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.980
And in an education,
we are faced with the same

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.020
challenges other industries face.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:37.270
Our goal is clearly to create
an enterprise architecture that

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.730
will unify our applications,
our databases,

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.880
streamline our information delivery and
finally create an integrated system.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.590
So we are clearly using some
of the leading technology.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.650
We use SAP for our ERP.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.700
We are 80% Apple shop.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.690
We have over 150,000 network devices.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.690
And the list goes on.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.700
I think we have almost every
vendor product in Broward.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:11.680
We are working with IBM, SAP, Cisco,
Microsoft and the list goes on.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.790
What you see here is a very interesting
slide and this kind of shows the

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.050
complexity of the educational enterprise.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:24.600
And mind you, it also resembles a typical
Fortune 500 company.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.760
What you see here is an ERP system
and if you look in detail,

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.330
you will see that there are a lot
of legacy systems and these are

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.200
mission-critical applications.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.120
You see decentralized
applications and databases.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.980
In a nutshell,
it's a fragmented technology.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.800
landscape.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.120
In addition to the
challenges enterprises face,

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:52.180
we also have our own
educational challenges.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.790
One key challenge is the
No Child Left Behind Act,

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.280
which Congress had passed in 2002.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.380
If I were to compare this act,
I would compare it to the quest of

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.560
Congress in the 1960s to put man on moon.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:13.110
It's a very pressing,
demanding law that looks at

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:19.780
accountability and by year 2014,
the goal is to make sure that we're

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:25.590
improving academic performance at all
levels for all students and eradicate

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.980
illiteracy completely by the year 2014.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.600
So that poses some unique challenges
and we are faced with the need to have

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.140
very strong testing protocols in place,
reporting requirements and

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.990
finally accountability.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:45.880
So our goal at Broward is by using
Apple's technology to effectively

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:52.640
integrate these silos of information and
move towards a complete total solution.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.600
To make this happen,
we are taking a very systematic approach.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.560
We are using a building block approach
where we are layering our technology.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.930
We are starting at the foundation
with infrastructure and we have

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.890
deployed Apple Xers in all our schools.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.100
That's 251 schools and
increasing day by day.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.200
We have laid a solid foundation
and our goal is to build advanced

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.390
applications on top of that and
effectively integrate people,

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.060
process and technology resources.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:27.990
Our goal is to reach to the top of the
pyramid and that's the knowledge layer.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.180
To get there,
to get to the portal layer or the

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.540
knowledge management environment,
we are embracing open standards and

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.880
this is where Apple is a good fit.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:43.990
Apple's OS X Tiger is embracing open
standards and open technology and

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:49.870
works very well with our goal to
take our diverse legacy applications

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.080
and effectively integrate it
into our educational enterprise.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.300
So here we go.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.900
Our goal is Project Nexus and
Project Nexus is Broward's

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.110
enterprise portal.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.160
Our goal is to have available
a single gateway to personalize

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:10.040
information which will help our key
constituents make the right decisions.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:16.260
We're able to create a unified view of
information and finally knit together

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.710
and streamline all our processes.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:32:58.500
[Transcript missing]

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.900
So here's something we're
trying to do right now.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.460
I think we're working with
Apple engineers and my staff is

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:10.340
also very working aggressively to
create some very unique widgets.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.650
We're looking at--

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.830
A phone directory which would
have presence awareness and

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.540
instant messaging built into it.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.180
We're looking at school calendars
which will show students' lesson

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.730
plans at the start of the day.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.280
We're looking at being able to
quickly look at attendance reports.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:33.860
Be able to look at the books that are
overdue and also alert students as to the

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.580
new books that are available in library.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.030
And finally the little bitty
handy helpers which go a long way.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:46.620
I think in schools we have some very
large volumes of binders of information

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.890
which deal with policies and procedures.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.270
We're able to quickly give our students,
teachers, and parents,

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.060
and administrators the policies
at their fingertips all with

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.300
the push of a function key.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.810
So in closing,
I think I would like to call to

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.960
action all the developers out here
and ask their cooperation in building

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.000
these true enterprise widgets.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.330
I think you can build widgets
that not only extend to

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:15.100
the educational enterprise,
but also go and help other industries.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.100
For example,
being able to get a dashboard view of

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.540
all your key reports and statistics.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.360
Being able to look at your NOC,
Network Operations Center,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.980
or other system management monitors.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.150
Being able to look at your KPIs,
or being able to quickly monitor

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.240
your hosted applications.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.660
Looking at bandwidth and looking at
effective utilization and availability.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.780
And finally,
with presence awareness and also

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:47.290
looking at hardware integration widgets,
you're able to manage and

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.480
monitor your whole enterprise.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.620
So in a nutshell,
what we see here is we have

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:59.170
achieved our goal of enhancing,
or increasing the utilization of

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.360
technology all with Apple products.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.300
And I'm very happy to say that we are
the leading technology school district

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.110
and we plan on being there forever.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.910
Thank you.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:25.310
Well thank you Vijay and I'm sure
that any of you who are in Fortune 500

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:31.070
IT shops find a lot of this very
familiar in that the message of open

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.250
standards really rings true here.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:43.160
Next I'd like to introduce Joe Duemel
from Aozora Bank and he's the

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.300
joint general manager there.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.300
Joe Duemel: Hi, this is Dan.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.300
This is a bank.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.940
This is a more typical IT enterprise
shop and he would like to share

00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:01.300
with you some of his experience with
Apple and with Mac and ideas about

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.270
open source and open standards.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:09.380
So Joe, welcome.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.720
So I'm sure the first question you have,
since you're probably not up to

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.920
date on all your Japanese banks,
is what is Azora Bank?

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.000
Azora Bank is a successful and
profitable bank in downtown Tokyo.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.030
They're primarily a commercial
and special finance bank.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.980
Azora recently turned
over its management team.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.150
And as part of that,
we looked at the challenge

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.340
of how do we manage systems,
technology and people that were

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.520
relatively stuck in the 1990s.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.020
Like some of the other presenters,
I also have everything in my data center.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.240
I have stacks of IBMs.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.950
I have the old tape drives
you see on old sci-fi movies.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.120
I have a pretty scary data center.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.520
The room that you're looking
at there is a tape library.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.280
It's a robotic tape library.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.420
It manages a whole 1.2 terabyte of data.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.850
Got a little robot in there,
zips back and forth.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.540
It was replaced by something
that looks about that high.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:09.740
We have a new management team.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.220
Part of the charter of the new management
team is they wanted to create an

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.940
environment of knowledge workers.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.980
They wanted to get rid of
a paper-based environment.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.720
They wanted to be an energetic or genki,
is the Japanese word for it, bank.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.890
They brought us on board and we
looked at this thing and we said,

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.190
okay, we don't want to deploy Windows.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.230
So we started with some rules
and the first rule is it's got

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.760
to contribute to good karma.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.660
And nobody gets good karma with Windows.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.110
We also discovered that we were
really building from the ground up.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.680
As we started this process, we thought,
okay, you know,

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.080
we'll replace the desktops, put,
you know, maybe some Linux in the

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.190
back end and we'll be fine.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.760
We started looking at replacing
the desktops and discovered we

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.270
needed to upgrade our network.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.890
Okay, I found out I had hubs
underneath the floors.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.540
I wouldn't have put them there,
but that's okay.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.660
We pull up the floors,
we look at the floors, we're like, okay,

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.020
we need a full recable.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.260
We start the recable effort, we say,
okay, now I need new switches.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.920
It's time to go to Cisco,
get all new switches, do this right,

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.020
because I don't want to do it again.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.660
As we did that,
we looked at our power requirements.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.330
I didn't have enough power per
floor to run my Cisco switches.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.190
So I said, okay,
we went to our power distribution

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.380
and we upgraded that and they said,
well, you know, you only got about five,

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.410
ten minutes of UPS.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.640
Okay, that doesn't really work either.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.970
We started pouring concrete
in the basement to put in new

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.520
UPSs so that we could put in
the power distribution units,

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.660
so we could put in the switches,
so we could build a data center.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.460
Fundamentally,
what we're looking at doing

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.760
is creating an IT revolution.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.300
We were going to replace
every single desktop unit.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.000
We were going to take the 75
different vendors in our data center,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.920
consolidate them down to maybe four.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.600
We were going to streamline
our systems and processes,

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.240
make it a manageable thing,
get rid of access databases

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.620
and Excel spreadsheets,
holding customer information, etc.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.040
So as we sat down and discussed it,
we decided we needed some rules.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.410
The first rule was education.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.540
We did not want to end up
being beholden to any vendor.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.140
We wanted to own our own environment.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.300
All our employees,
all the guys who run the

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.740
stuff daily are Japanese.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.650
You know, when you deal with a U.S.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.080
vendor, you have to make sure that
you have the right education.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.040
So we made education
a very high priority.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.130
We wanted our people
to run their systems.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:39.320
Design Design was really important to us.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.460
Design of the work environment,
design of the systems environment,

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.000
design of the business processes.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.080
Design was important to get right because
without it we were back to the bad

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.060
karma thing and it wasn't looking good.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.990
Partnership We knew that
we couldn't do this alone.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.140
We knew that we had to go
to the industry leaders,

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.680
people like Apple, people like Cisco,
people like EMC Documentum,

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.820
people like TIBCO for integration.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.810
We needed this stuff to work
and we needed to go to the

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.300
people who knew it best.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.960
So as you look at this,
this is a pretty big IT investment.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.720
We're spending $30,
$40 million trying to get this

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.580
right and that's just the first cut.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.030
So we wanted to do it right.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.640
We knew that partnership was
going to be really important.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.350
More rules.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.740
First thing about partners,
they have to be an innovation leader.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.160
They have to own their space.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.870
When you mention their name,
people have to go, yeah, networking,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.420
they got it.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.530
Apple, yeah, desktops, they got it.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:37.600
They have to train our people
in their intellectual property.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.880
Again, one of the things that really
broke earlier was that it was

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:44.100
really hard to separate our
people from the vendor armies that

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.040
kept giving me consulting bills.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.260
So it was important for me to
actually really own my enterprise.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.800
Mutual non-disclosure.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.500
As you work in any of these partnerships,
you find that you need to

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.980
plan ahead five to ten years.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.480
Planning ahead five to ten years
means you need to know what your

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.290
vendors are going to do and they
need to know what you're going to do.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.610
So mutual non-disclosure
became really important to us.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.160
And the last one is
executive level sponsorship.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.970
As you do a partnership like this,
whether it's a partnership with Apple,

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.680
partnership with Cisco,
stuff's going to go wrong.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.600
It's not all perfect, it never is.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.120
It's important to be able
to go to someone and say,

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.130
hey, look, help me make this work.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:20.580
And share an idea with them.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:20.620
And share an idea with them.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.620
on both our successes and our problems.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:28.180
So, as I described this to our management
committee and as we worked together,

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.800
the question we kept hearing was,
why Apple?

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.670
The answer we thought was really clear.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:37.460
Undeniably, they're the leader in
the field in innovation,

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:41.000
both hardware, software,
both for the enterprise and the desktop.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.930
They really had it.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.260
The second was access to the
best and brightest minds.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.780
It was really important to us to
be able to go to the people at

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.420
Apple that make things work and go,
how do I do this here?

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.560
Because it doesn't make sense.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.920
One of the things we looked at
is as we were trying to pull

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:03.480
all our systems together is,
you know, okay, I got Java, I got Unix,

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.980
I got 3270,
I've got some legacy Windows stuff

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:10.290
that runs in terminal servers,
I've got X Windows,

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.010
how do I make it work?

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.710
The nice thing with OS X?

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:14.870
It all just works.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.110
Don't have to do a whole lot
different to make it work.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.640
Highly internationalized.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.520
My kanji's really bad.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.360
I'm really happy that I can
flip into an English screen.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.780
A lot of the Japanese employees
are really happy that I'm not

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.320
trapping them in an English screen.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.050
The fact that OS X is
internationalized from the ground up,

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.150
that Apple is built with a view
towards being internationalized,

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.710
is critically important to us.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.490
And Apple's really energetic,
and that was real important.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.860
So I told you earlier I was going to
show you what our employees work at.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.770
Basically everybody has their very own
three and a half feet of linear space,

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.420
which they share with whatever
books and coffee cups they

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.740
want to put on their desk.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.080
They sit next to each other.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.620
They're separated by a file cabinet.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.800
This is not a knowledge
worker environment.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:09.800
So we destroyed it.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.540
and David Right now I have
20 floors in my headquarters,

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:18.240
I have six floors in my data center
and I'm progressively destroying

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.740
it floor by floor and replacing it.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.400
Here's what we're replacing it with.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.360
This is prior to our first rollout.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.520
One of the scarier sites
I've ever seen in my life,

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:38.100
every one of those ended up
VESA mounted in cubicles.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.850
And as you VESA mounted them,
you take the old stand off.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.300
We stacked the stands from one
side of the floor to the other.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.160
It was kind of interesting.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.600
So some of the challenges
we're looking at.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.540
We're a bank.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.000
We are legally responsible for
our customers' information.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.430
It's very important in Japan that
customer information never get out.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.920
We don't quite get the same option that
they might have in the US as saying,

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.890
"Oops, I lost it." You say, "Oops,
I lost it." They say,

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:09.980
"You lost your banking
license." My management says,

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:09.980
"That's bad."

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:12.190
We have a high need of integration.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.200
I mean, we do have a bunch of systems.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.080
When we first looked at this,
we were going to use Mac on the desktop,

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.280
not in the server room.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.050
We had to get this stuff working.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.890
I have tons of paper on every floor.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.300
We're actually lightening our
building's earthquake load because

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.010
we're moving the paper into Documentum,
which gets backed up into big, you know,

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.110
terabytes and terabytes of storage, etc.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:36.070
But I needed to make Documentum, TIBCO,
Oracle, everything work right.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.940
When we started this process,
it didn't all work on Apple.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.490
So we had to go to TIBCO and say, "Hey,
we need some help." TIBCO responded.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:45.660
They worked with Apple.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.240
Apple and TIBCO got together.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.460
They got together a beta version
of their messaging product,

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.560
their system management tool
and I'm pretty happy to say that

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.110
they're now generally available.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.760
They've been released,
which means I can run them in production,

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.760
which is a good thing.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.770
Also,
they've also--TIBCO is also committed

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.920
to porting the rest of their product
stack to OS X by the end of the year,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.780
so that really helps me as well.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.160
So the question I get asked
from the Apple people is

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.880
when are you going to Tiger?

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.800
So I'm kind of weird.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.600
My management asked me
why I'm going to Apple,

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.580
why Apple?

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.140
Apple asked me when am I going to Tiger?

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.830
The answer is I started out on Tiger.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.620
I had no choice.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.210
Tiger has the only security
model that would work.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:30.590
All my clients are net
boot with encrypted swap.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.490
I do not have any customer
data on any disk on the floor.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:35.870
To me that was absolutely critical.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.490
It's that banking license thing.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.630
They seem to care.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.500
The second thing is card services.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.910
My security model is pretty tight.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.300
It's a combination of what you have,
which is your physical key card,

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.500
and what you know,
which is your password.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.790
So basically that key card also
controls the ability to come

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.870
in and out of the building.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.620
If you go to the restroom,
you pull out the key card.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.290
The Mac flips using,
I think at the moment it's a

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.740
user switch to a screen saver.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:07.760
You go to the bathroom, come back in,
plug it back in, you're back in.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.500
The next thing is the ACLs.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.600
You've kind of heard a lot from them.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.780
They were critical for us.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.180
I do full role-based authentication.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.510
I know when anybody touches any data.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.510
And I really needed the ACLs and
client lockdown based on roles.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:22.730
The other thing that really,
really hit us is manageability.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.050
Tokyo real estate is a little expensive.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.240
It was important for me to be able
to put my help desk out in Fuchu.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:31.110
Fuchu is our data center,
about 30 kilometers,

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.430
maybe 40 kilometers outside of Tokyo.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.510
But I had executives and
executives need help.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.850
It was important that my help desk
guys could help my executives.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.820
So what we've done is every single
map has got an iSite on top of it.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.430
We support video conferencing
for every employee.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.030
We're kind of hoping to tweak the
interaction model a little bit.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.730
And our help desk will use that.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.810
Our help desk basically
will initiate a video chat,

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:03.400
ask permission to take over the desktop
with Apple Remote Desktop and then

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.980
basically show them how to start Word,
start Mail, find their document for them.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.710
The other thing that was kind of helpful,
I mean I've never personally figured out,

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.990
you know,
how do you manage 2,000 of these things?

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:16.480
Apple has.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.110
Work Group Manager and
Server Administrator or Server Admin,

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.180
been great for it.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:23.590
One of the weird things that
happened after we'd made the

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.100
decision is some of our quants,
and for those people not in finance,

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.900
these are the people that
really like numbers and are

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.390
relatively boring to talk to.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.090
They came to us and said,
we need you to build a supercomputer.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.920
And we're like, okay.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.630
Never quite done that.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.200
But instead, what we're going to
probably do is use XGrid.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.720
And we're going to use XGrid and use
some of the unused CPU models and

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.280
then look at building a supercomputer.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.920
I don't think we can
do as cool with video,

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.590
but hopefully we'll get by a little bit.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.120
So here's what I wanted to end with.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.660
This is floor one done.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.820
This is the 16th floor
in our headquarters.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.880
I only have 19 more floors to
do and a whole data center.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.820
But we're creating switchers
110 at a time every three weeks.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.760
So thank you very much.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.380
Thanks a lot, Joe.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:31.210
So I think I like the
switcher aspect of that.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.030
Next, from Rotech Healthcare,
we have Albert Prast, who is both the

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:40.660
Chief Information Officer and
the Chief Technology Officer.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.090
And he's going to tell us
about their experience.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:46.230
You may not have heard of Rotech,
but he'll explain that there is

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.520
probably a Rotech near you somewhere.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.130
And he'll talk about his
experience with the Mac and with

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:58.370
open standards and open source.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:58.380
So, Al?

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.400
Thank you.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.200
Thank you.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200
I'm glad to be here.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:16.900
This is the first time I've been to
an Apple event and I'm very impressed.

00:49:17.000 --> 01:02:19.500
[Transcript missing]

01:02:24.000 --> 01:05:33.700
[Transcript missing]

01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:36.100
Junk mail and virus filtering.

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:40.890
Spam Assassin is the open source
project that we have integrated in.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:49.270
It's a very high quality spam killer,
both in terms of adaptively identifying

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.660
spam and getting rid of it at the
server and taking blacklist feeds

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.370
to remove spam from blacklists
which are available on the internet.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:03.240
Virus protection via Clam AV,
another open source project

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.680
integrated in with our mail server.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:10.100
We'll return or delete or quarantine
or whatever you want to do with

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.300
those viruses if they come in.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.060
Not that those viruses
will affect your Macs,

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:19.300
but you don't want to be passing
them on to Windows machines as well.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:26.040
Xgrid, you heard an example of, you know,
IT CIO gets told, hey,

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.300
we want a supercomputer,
our quants need something like that.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.690
Take a look at Xgrid.

01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:34.330
It's built into both client and server,
so it's there on every

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:37.900
single system of Tiger,
whether it's server or client.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.060
Secure, you don't have to run a
node as an Xgrid node.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:47.110
You can enable it, though,
and it gets authenticated and will only

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:50.060
run the jobs that you want it to run.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:58.840
And then finally, XSAN version 1.1,
available on Tiger.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.870
So it's really XSAN for Tiger.

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.520
It's available for Tiger and Panther.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.320
The benefits are large-scale
storage consolidation.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.110
So 64-bit file system,
up to two petabytes in size of storage,

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:18.210
virtually no performance or volume
or scalability limitations in this.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.580
Consolidate literally hundreds
of thousands of files.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:25.590
And it's available for hundreds of
XSERV RAIDs for increased performance.

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.040
And best of all, it's a free update.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.440
All users of XSAN 1.0 will
get XSAN 1.1 for free.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:38.510
And to wrap up,
I just want to call your attention

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.640
to a few very good sessions to go to.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.930
Apple Data Center,
First Flow Moscone West,

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.500
right down below.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.640
Take a visit there.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.220
Look at an example of
an Apple IT Data Center.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:56.430
Interactive panel discussion at 7 p.m.

01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:57.820
on Tuesday.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.220
Don't miss that.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.400
O'Reilly brown bags are great.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:07.040
If you've got an interest in Python, PHP,
Perl, MySQL, I love O'Reilly.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:07.840
O'Reilly's great.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.870
Go to the brown bags.

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.230
Late night labs.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.540
Again, Apple experts in areas
of Mac OS X server.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:20.220
How do you put a Mac OS X server
in a heterogeneous environment?

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.420
What's Apple Remote Desktop all about?

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.240
How do you deploy an XAN, web objects,
et cetera?

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.300
So these late night labs are
incredibly valuable time you can spend

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:33.160
with Apple experts in these areas.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.580
And then finally,
Oracle Database 10G on Mac OS X server.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.440
Friday,
June 10th at 10.30 at Second Level,

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.150
Alcove 3, across from Enterprise IT Lab.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.140
Talk to Oracle.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.960
People learn about
Oracle 10G on Mac OS X.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.830
And finally, as I mentioned,
40% of the attendees are

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:54.980
IT-related at this conference.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.820
And so we have a ton of sessions.

01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:01.040
They're in your notebook
that you got handed out.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.660
They're in your notebook that you
got handed out with your badge.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.290
So, you know,
I'm not going to go through all these,

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.160
but I'll just click through them.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:10.350
And finally,
thank you very much for coming to

01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:12.480
Worldwide Developer Conference 2005.
