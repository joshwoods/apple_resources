WEBVTT

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.960
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.640
Welcome to AMP on Mac OS X.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.840
Thank you for coming to
our session this morning.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm John Montbriand.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.870
I work in the
Developer Technical Support Division at

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.300
Apple Computer.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.470
I take care of the technical notes,
the sample code,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.030
the Q&A collections on our website,
and a lot of these tools

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.350
I get to use during my job,
and I'll be talking to

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.420
you about them today.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.030
This is Nathan Dentonfast.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.360
He's graciously volunteered to come
and run the demos along with you.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.290
There is going to be some
typing involved in this session,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.810
and I'm going to watch Nathan as he
goes through to give you appropriate

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.020
time to do the things that you
need to do to accomplish the things

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.740
you need to do in this session.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.900
And I'll use that as a
gauge for timing things.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.580
So we're going to talk about today.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.270
We're going to talk about Apache.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.220
We're going to talk about MySQL, PHP,
and Tiger.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.220
We're going to talk about
what we install by default.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.020
On the client version of Tiger.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.320
We're not going to talk about the
server version of Tiger today.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.370
We're going to talk about extras
that you can install on your own,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.880
and we're going to talk about

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.990
Apache, we're going to turn it on.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.360
We're going to show you how to do that.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.770
We're going to show you how to
edit the configuration for Apache.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.430
Then we're going to show you how
to edit the configuration for PHP,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.800
how to enable that.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.180
And we have Marc Liyanage here.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.580
And many of you may be
familiar with his website.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.280
He has a lot of downloads, installers,
single clickable package installers

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.940
for the latest versions of PHP,
MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.180
He has some really exciting demos to
show you that we'll be showing you later.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.030
And for the last hands-on part,
we're going to show you how to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.090
set up several virtual hosts on
your own laptop computer for local

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.540
testing of websites and whatnot.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.870
And we'll end off with some Q&A.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.200
So in this session,
we're going to be using

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.140
these applications.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.880
You don't have to be a real
expert in using Xcode to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.500
follow along in this session.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.020
We're just going to be
using it as a text editor.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.440
And the hands-on parts are going
to be with these guided hands-on

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360
slide sections like shown here.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660
And I'm going to step you
through the different commands

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.640
that we're going to do.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
For example,
here we're saying open apple.com,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.360
and then click on the
developer link in Safari.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.630
Moving along,
the next thing I want to point

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.320
out is there are no downloadables
for this session in particular.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.700
We don't have any sample code,
but we are going to talk about a lot of

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.860
different installers in this session.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.410
And you'll probably be tempted
to download them right away,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.660
but please be aware that if you download
them right away during this session,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.060
you'll probably crash the network and
nobody will be able to use the network.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.580
So please wait until after before
you download any installers.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.280
So, what's installed on Mac OS X?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.200
Apache 1.3.33.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.880
We have PHP 4.3.1.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.040
That's an older version,
but Marc Liyanage has an updater

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.840
for PHP 5.0 on his website.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.980
He'll be demoing that later.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.450
We have mod.php installed,
but it's not enabled in Apache.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.600
We're going to show you how to turn on
mod.php later so you can have PHP running

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.180
on your computer in your Apache.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.940
We have Perl 5.84.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.770
Mod Perl is installed,
but you need to enable that specifically

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.030
in your HTTP configuration to use
it on your Apache on your local

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.000
machine if you want to use that.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.190
Python 2.35 is installed.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.900
Ruby is installed.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.960
We have 1.81.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.680
We have an update to
1.82 on Darwin Ports.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.940
I'll be showing these links later on,
so don't worry about recording them now.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.560
Now, the extras that you can
install on your machine.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.260
We have MySQL.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.670
Because we're talking
about the client OS,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.070
we don't come with,
on the client version of

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.490
Mac OS Tiger with MySQL pre-installed.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500
This is something you'd go and install.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.060
There are some really good installer
packages that you can just double-click

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.600
and run on the MySQL website.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.590
There's one thing that
you'd want to be aware of.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.640
If you want to try the latest
MySQL with the installed version of PHP,

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.360
it's not going to work.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.240
So what you should probably do,
if you want to use the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.080
installed version of PHP,
then use 4.0.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.140
Because 4.1, there's a password hash
and compatibility issue.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.900
But if you want to use the latest
version of PHP and the latest

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.990
version of MySQL... Of course,
you want to go to Mark's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.670
website and use his installers.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.680
PostgreSQL is another option.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.520
There is an installer on Marc's site
that we'll be talking about later,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.560
or he might mention.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.610
If you're interested in upgrading
to a more complete version of SQL or

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.530
you're just interested in Postgre,
that's available for you.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.690
So, this is the first hands-on part.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.120
We're going to do Apache and Tiger,
give you a taste of what our

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.330
hands-on thing is going to be like.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.400
First thing we're going to do
is we're going to try it out.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500
This is Apache's web server link,
and they have a whole

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.040
website set up there.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.790
And let's turn on Apache.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.960
First thing you need to do is go
to your system preferences control

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.950
panel and select the sharing icon.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.130
So the first thing we do
is we select sharing and we

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.180
turn on personal web sharing.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.500
This here turns on
Apache on your machine.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.320
You don't have to do anything
else once you've done that.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.480
As soon as you've turned on Apache,
you'll notice on the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.440
bottom of the screen here,
it will show you your network

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.290
address for your Apache.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.620
If you wanted to let somebody else on
the same network as you access the web

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.320
pages that you're hosting on your laptop,
say, you can give them these addresses

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.190
and they'll be able to browse your
web pages on your local machine.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.340
So we've turned on Apache,
and Nathan's going to demo.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.950
Can we switch over to demo one?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.350
So here's turning on Apache and
in the system preferences.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.760
So how's everybody doing with
our hands-on session so far?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.090
Are we all okay?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.910
So here's turning on Apache and
in the system preferences.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.000
We're not going to actually use
the network during this session.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.620
So we can switch back to slides.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.670
Oh, if you can't see the
address on the bottom,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.440
that's okay.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.290
That's just because your
machine doesn't have a network

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.840
connection at the current time.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.660
And what that will mean is you can
still use Apache on your machine.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.700
It's up and running,
but you just can't use it on the network.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.160
Once you're connected to a network,
that address will show up

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.760
and you can advertise that or
email it to people if you like.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.280
So the next thing we're going
to do is we're going to talk

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.240
about the Apache Control.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.350
The Apache Control command line
tool is the other way that you can

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.160
control Apache on your machine.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.330
The statements I'm showing
here is Apache Control status.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.840
You can try that in your
terminal program and that will

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.680
show you the status of Apache.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.050
Or here's the man page.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.080
You don't have to use
this command right now.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.330
We'll be using this command later
in this presentation to show you

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.040
how to use it to restart Apache.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.980
So let's try out Apache.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.380
We just turned it on.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.500
You can run it on your laptop
right now if you followed me in the

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.920
System Preferences Control Panel.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.560
And we're going to switch over to Demo 1.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.160
And we're going to browse local host.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.660
So on your machine,
you'll find that we've already

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.700
preloaded Apache and we've
preloaded the documentation for

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.990
Apache in the local host address
and the default address for Apache.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.290
So we can switch back to slides.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.680
The next thing we're going to
do is we're going to take a look

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.510
at where the configuration files
for Apache are on your machine.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.520
They're located in the directories
etc.httpd.http.configuration

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.400
and etc.httpd.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.830
We also have, there's a group of
files that are browsed,

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.370
and we're going to take advantage
of this in the users directory

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.380
in the http configuration folder.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.470
Now, if you wanted to take
a look at these files,

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.460
you could follow the hands-on
instructions I provided up here.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.500
I'm not going to get
Nathan to do that today.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.200
But you can open the etc.http directory.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.930
Maybe I'll follow you
and you can do that.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:06.500
[Transcript missing]

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.140
What did we do here?

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.770
We went through, we turned on Apache,
we located the configuration files,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.000
we let you see where they are.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.560
The next thing we're going to do
is we're going to turn on PHP.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.900
So if you're browsing your local
web files on your computer,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.500
you can use and run PHP programs in
your web pages running on your computer.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.690
So the first thing we're going to do,
it's not turned on by default,

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.020
so we're going to have to go and
edit the HTTP configuration file.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.660
So the first thing we're going
to do before we go and edit

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.840
the HTTP configuration file
is we're going to back it up.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.440
And the steps below
show you how to do that.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.900
You need to run these
in the terminal program.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.450
And if you're typing along,
I'm following Nathan here,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.340
and he's doing these commands here.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.900
The first command will set the current
execution directory for running commands

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.290
to the HTTP configuration directory.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.140
The second command here
is a pseudo command.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.620
That means run this
command as system user.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.740
And all we're going to do here is copy
the configuration file to a backup.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.650
It's going to ask you for your system
password the first time through,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.860
because this is a system user command.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.270
You need to have system
permissions to run this command.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.770
The second last command is we're going
to set the permissions so we can go in

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.170
and edit our HTTP configuration file.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.180
Okay, moving along.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.500
The next thing we're going
to do is we're going to edit

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.160
the HTTP configuration file.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.000
So the first thing you do is you
type this command into the terminal.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.990
What that's...

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.490
Okay, I'll slow down.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.470
Sorry about that.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.150
We can go back to that.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.230
How about I give, if I go too fast,
just put up your hand

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.070
please for the typing,
and then I'll know.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.230
He'll type a little slower.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.940
Okay, so the next thing we're going
to do is we're going to edit

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.800
the HTTP configuration file.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.490
The first thing we do is type
this command into the terminal.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.500
What this is going to do is
it's going to tell the finder,

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.960
it's going to send an event over
to the finder asking it to open the

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.860
folder so we can look at all the icons
in the HTTP configuration folder.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.530
The reason we're doing this in the
terminal is because normally this

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.490
folder is hidden from the user
to prevent unnecessary editing.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.230
The next thing we're going to
do is we're going to switch over

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.910
to the finder and we're going to
look through the configuration

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.300
directory that we just opened.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:58.490
And we're going to drag and drop the
HTTP configuration file into Xcode.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.790
So everybody caught up
with the typing there?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.940
We're going to use Xcode here,
and we've got a demo

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.890
set up for this part.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.530
So let's switch over to demo one.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.630
We're going to drag and drop.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.180
OK, let's go over to the Finder.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.780
You can use any text
editor you want here.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.680
The main thing is it shouldn't
alter the line endings of the file.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.600
If you make a mistake here, it's okay.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.600
We've switched over to Xcode here.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.360
You can see that there's a lot
of information in this file.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.740
There's a lot of really valuable comments
that will explain different parts.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.090
What we're looking for in
particular here is the lines

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.290
starting with the module PHP.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.820
If you just search for the word PHP,
you'll find these lines.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.340
We can switch back to slides.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.160
So what we're going to do in that file
is we're going to find these lines.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:06.420
And the first two lines here is load
module PHP 4 and the add module PHP 4.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.620
All we're going to do here is
remove the little hash marks from

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.980
the beginning of those two lines.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.890
And I'll watch Nathan here as he
goes through and scrolls through

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.330
manually and changes those.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.860
Okay, and then the last thing
you do is save and close.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.890
Everybody caught up with me there?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.760
Go back here.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:52.100
We're looking for... What we're
doing is we're turning on PHP.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.600
We're enabling PHP in this section.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.190
And all we're doing is we're
uncommenting these lines.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.620
The first one, load module, PHP 4 module,
what that will do is

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.520
load the module into PHP.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.180
You'll notice that there's separate
load modules and add modules.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.060
The add module will actually
activate the module.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.570
Once you've loaded the module,
it doesn't actually become active.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.600
It's kind of inside of Apache until
you run the add module command.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.640
So you can selectively turn it
on and off for different websites

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.270
on your machine if you like.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.840
The next thing we're going to do is
we're going to activate the changes.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.580
We just edited the configuration file,
saved it to disk, and closed it.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.400
And the next thing we're going
to do is activate the changes.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.360
So the first, the reason we need to,
we need to do this to,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.820
we need to restart Apache.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.060
We've changed the configuration file,
we need to force Apache to reload it.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.180
So the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to set the,

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.730
in the terminal,
we're going to set the execution

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.540
directory for our commands to the
Apache configuration directory.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.230
We can ask questions at the end.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.440
We'll have time for Q&A then.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.440
OK.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.880
The next thing we're going to want
to do is we're going to set the

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.540
permissions back on the configuration
file to what they originally were.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:42.300
[Transcript missing]

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:55.800
[Transcript missing]

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.160
Okay, so what did we just do?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.450
We just turned on mod.php and we
edited the Apache configuration file

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.950
to enable that and we enabled PHP.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.440
Our next section,
we're going to explore and

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.870
configure PHP in Tiger.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.180
We're going to take a
look at what's installed.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.780
We have 4.3.1.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.790
They have their website on-- well,
that's their address up there.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.970
Let's try it out.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.800
If you want to try PHP in Tiger,
you can type in the commands above here.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.360
If you've followed along so far,
we've turned on Apache,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.800
we've turned on PHP.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:39.160
The commands up here will allow you
to create your own document that we

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.480
can try out our PHP on our machine.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.540
The first line here,
we're setting the execution directory

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.360
to the default configuration web
server directory on our machine.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.650
The second line here,
we're writing out a PHP file.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.400
It's a very simple program.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.750
As you can see there,
we're just echoing to the

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.560
PHP in the current directory.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:07.150
Our PHP program is actually this
center little section in here.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.720
The next thing we're going to do
is we're going to go to Safari and

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.200
we're going to open this link.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.210
If you set up everything correctly,
we'll have the PHP info

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.620
page that we can browse.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.370
I believe that's already pre-installed,
isn't it?

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.730
Then we're going to browse the PHP page.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.990
So everybody can probably see
the PHP info page right now.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.540
We're going to switch
over for a demo here,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.300
but we don't have the
password for this machine,

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.250
so we can't do that right now.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.640
So we're going to switch ahead.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.160
To editing the
configuration files for PHP.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.100
The configuration files for
PHP are in the ETC directory.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:11.430
There's a file named phpini,
and there's the phpini.default.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.910
And if you want to take a
look at where these files are,

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.520
you can type openetc in the terminal,
and then you can browse

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.380
the etc directory.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.760
You want to locate the ini default file.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.440
You'll notice that the
PHP ini file is not there.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.150
Basically,
all the settings in the default

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.240
file are the default settings
that we've compiled into PHP.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.100
If you want to make your
own custom settings,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.850
what you'll do is you'll make
a duplicate copy of the ini

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.250
default file into PHP ini,
and go and edit that.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.980
And we're going to do exactly
that in the next part.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.060
First thing we're going to
do is we're going to create

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.510
a new PHP ini default file.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.640
Oh, OK.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.490
Can we switch over to-- this is our
earlier demo that we found the password.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.770
Can we switch over to demo one?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.040
So this is the PHP configuration file,
or INI file, that we created.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.900
We're showing PHP info about the
PHP installed on this machine here.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.000
Different packages, what's turned on,
what's enabled, what's not enabled.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.490
So we can switch back to slides.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.640
So we're going to create our own
custom PHP configuration file.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.600
And the first thing
we're going to do here,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.060
we're going to set our
execution directory to etc.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.020
The next command we're going
to make a duplicate copy of

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.690
the PHP INI default file,
and we're going to name it PHP INI.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:52.900
What this command does
is it has a "-p" option,

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.980
so we're going to preserve all
the options such as the ownership,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.900
the permissions, things like that.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:03.120
Then the very last statement here,
we're going to open up the read/write

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.900
permissions so we can go in and
edit that file and make changes.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.000
So the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to go in and we're going

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.980
to open to edit the PHP INI file.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.740
First thing we're going to do
is type in the terminal openetc.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.560
That will open up a window in the
finder so we can browse and locate.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.180
We're going to look around in the finder
window to locate our PHP INI file.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.490
And the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to drop PHP INI into Xcode.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.620
We have a demo of that.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.190
Can we switch over to demo one?

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.620
So here we've located INI default,
or INI,

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.250
and we're going to drop that into Xcode.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.800
Inside of this file
there's a lot of comments,

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.760
so you can learn a lot about what the
different configuration options mean.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.560
We'll switch back over to slides, please.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.500
Now, the ones I wanted to point
out today are these options.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.590
They're ones that I've
changed during my work,

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.690
and they're probably ones that
you might want to take a look at.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.900
The memory limit of 8 megabytes is, well,
for some processing tasks,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.610
it might be kind of small.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.420
You might want to bump that up,
depending on what your requirements are.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.820
If you're finding your tasks are halting
because they're running out of memory,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.960
then this is the one you
want to go in and modify.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.700
The next ones, Magic Quotes, GPC.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.850
I like to turn this one off.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.610
I think on a number of configurations,
including ours,

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.100
it's turned on by default.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.260
This can be a major source of confusion
if you're just starting working with PHP.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.820
What it does is it will put little
backslashes into all the data your

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:54.080
script receives as from cookies
and from post and get data.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.190
So you probably want to turn this off.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.010
Some people,
they get mistaken and they think, "Oh,

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.410
this must be MySQL that's inserting these
slashes," but actually it's happening

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.920
because of this option being turned on.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:10.130
The next thing you might want to
change is the maximum file size.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.120
If you're uploading files and
your testing software allows

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.150
you to upload files and they're
larger than two megabytes,

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.430
you'll probably want to adjust
this limit to something larger.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.340
And the last thing you want to
do is save and close this file.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.730
So has everybody caught up with me here?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.750
You don't have to go
change these settings,

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.800
I just wanted to make you aware of them.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.830
So in case you're working
with PHP or trying it out,

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.880
you can go ahead and change those.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.460
The next thing we want to do is
we want to activate the changes.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.360
And basically to do that,
the first thing we're going to

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:51.550
do is we're going to set the
execution directory to etc.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.120
Then we're going to set the permissions
back to what they were before we started.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.620
It will work otherwise.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.340
I like to just keep things the
way they're supposed to be.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.590
I think it's also a security hole to
leave the permissions open so others

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.180
can go in and write to your files and
configuration files on your machine.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.680
It's a personal preference of yours.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.050
I'm being a little bit fastidious here,
but that's up to you.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.340
The last statement we're doing here
is we're restarting Apache using

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.400
the Apache control statement
that I mentioned earlier.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.660
This does exactly the same
thing as turning on and off the

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.090
checkbox for personal web sharing.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:33.840
You're right.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.130
So we're going to test it out.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.080
So earlier, you would have entered in the
PHP info script in the local host,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.770
which we weren't able to do.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.340
Or no, we were able to do that, actually.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.170
And so to test this out and to
look at our new PHP options,

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.880
you can open that script
again using this URL.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.330
And then you can browse
the PHP page in Safari.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.620
Now, what did we just do here?

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.350
We located and showed you where the
PHP file initialization files are,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.880
and we edited the configuration files.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.920
Now there are some PHP installers
we wanted to show you.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.660
I have Marc Liyanage here.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.760
If you're familiar or you're a
web developer working with PHP,

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.820
you're probably familiar
with his website.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.460
And he's going to show you some
of the more recent installers

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.970
that he has available.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.230
So here's Marc.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.380
Thank you, John.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.360
Some of you might have used
my PHP installer packages,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.880
the one I published on my website.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.380
And I basically, I maintain these so that
PHP web developers don't

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.370
have to mess with compiling,
linking, make files, all of that stuff.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.990
The difference between my modules
and the one that are included

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.140
in Tiger is that mine are always
tracking the official PHP releases.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.220
So whenever the PHP group
releases a new version of PHP 4.0,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.220
they're always tracking
the official PHP releases.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.220
So whenever the PHP group
releases a new version of PHP 4.0,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.220
they're always tracking
the official PHP releases.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.720
So whenever the PHP group releases
a new version of PHP 4.0 or PHP 5.0,

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.580
I'm updating it as soon as possible,
usually within a few days.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.790
And these updates sometimes bring
new features and sometimes they bring

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.520
pretty important security fixes.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.470
Another difference of my modules is
that they come with a lot of extensions.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.150
Extensions extend the
PHP language with new features,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.520
for example, graphics processing,
XML processing, databases,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.950
additional types of databases,
things like that.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:38.240
So the website,
if you could switch to Demo Machine 2,

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.830
please.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.900
This is what the website looks like.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.020
There are two things
I want to show you here,

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.900
the extensions that are added.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.900
The first thing I want to show you
is the available PHP packages here.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.900
You can see that there
is PHP 5 and PHP 4.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.900
Both modules are available
for Apache 1 and Apache 2.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.950
So there is a big mix of modules,
like a matrix,

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:04.900
and you can choose whatever you want.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.900
Usually I say you should use
PHP 5 for all new development,

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.900
because PHP 5 added interesting
object-oriented features.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.450
Use PHP 4 if you have to.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.980
The other thing on a website that
might be very interesting for you

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:27.610
is the user support forums up here.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:27.610
If you go to these forums,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.180
There are lots of people in the
PHP forum where you can get support,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.380
ask questions,
and people are quite helpful there.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:42.760
So if you could switch back to slides,
please.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.940
As I said,
you have to choose one of the modules.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:01.140
Just one of the things you
might need to produce PDF files.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.370
My module includes the
PDF lib extensions,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.330
which allows you to create PDF documents.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.600
And there you have two versions.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.120
You have a commercial version
if you bought a license key,

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.570
and you have a free version.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.400
So that's another thing
you need to choose.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.350
So I guess if you want to pick a module,
just look through the

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.170
instructions on the website,
and you'll find out pretty quickly

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.980
what's the right one for you.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.920
The installation packages
when you download it.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.510
This is what you get.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.510
If you could switch back to demo 2,
please.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.800
This is what you get if you
download an installation package.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.800
It's just the regular
installation stuff you know from

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.800
Apple and third-party companies.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.610
What this package does,
it does two things.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.060
First,
it installs all of the software onto

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.800
your machine into a separate directory.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.800
What this also means is it doesn't
mess with any of Apple's stuff.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.970
So there's always a way to
cleanly remove these packages and

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.800
revert to what Apple is shipping.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.800
The second thing the
installation package does,

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.800
it enables the module
in Apache configuration.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.700
So what John told you before,
how to basically manipulate

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.750
the Apache configuration file,
that is what the package does on itself.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:22.930
Can we go back to slides, please?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:45.200
[Transcript missing]

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.420
One is there's an extension
in PHP called GD that allows

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.060
you to create bitmap images.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.270
I created one that allows
you to create Aqua buttons.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.090
Do some text here.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.070
Pick a color.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.070
And you see it renders the image.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.800
It's a regular PNG image at the end.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.350
You can open it up.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.920
This is pretty useful, for example,
if you have a website and you

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.140
would like to create headings and
you have to use a corporate font.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.820
It has to be exactly this font,
so you can render it as bitmaps.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:29.290
You can just, by changing the image
links in your HTML code,

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.320
basically, you can change it,
and a new bitmap image will

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.880
be rendered on the fly.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.380
This can be pretty useful,
and you can get pretty fancy

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.740
with the graphic effects.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.680
You see this one has
like the glossy look,

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.810
it has shadows and everything,
which is pretty hard to

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:47.620
reproduce using just HTML.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.840
The other thing I'm going to show
you is also a graphic example.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.630
It's generating PDFs.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:14.700
[Transcript missing]

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:28.400
and Zoom in a bit.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:28.400
You can see that it
really is vector imagery,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:28.400
it's not bitmaps.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:28.400
And so this allows you to create high
quality print output from your websites.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:38.500
Thank you, John.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:48.900
So right about now,
maybe everybody's thinking

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.840
about going to his website.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.250
But please don't go down and
load his installers just yet,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.400
so people can use the network.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.630
Can we switch back to slides, please?

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.290
So we're going to go through now
a hands-on session for setting

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.480
up and configuring some virtual
websites on your computer.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.000
We're just going to set up one
virtual website and a default one.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.560
And what this will allow you
to do is to do local testing on

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.790
your computer rather than testing
on your main server on the web.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.240
There's some great
reasons for doing that.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.560
You know, you get a fast turnaround time.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.370
You're running locally,
so you don't have to run

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.280
it across the network,
copy files to a server.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.760
You can do your own
testing on your own laptop.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.050
You don't even need to be connected to
the network to do testing of Apache and

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.120
your website on your computer.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.410
So we're going to simulate a
real-world server on your computer,

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.520
and we're going to give
it an address like WWDC.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:45.160
And we're going to put the documents
for that into the library web

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.000
server document slash WWDC folder.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.970
There's two parts to this whole thing.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.440
The first thing is setting up
a name for the virtual host.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.350
And the second part is setting up
the Apache servers so it knows how

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:03.880
to recognize the names and map the
requests over to the right directories.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.980
I'm going to keep this little guide
on the screen here so you can follow

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.720
along and see where we are in this part.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.690
It's kind of a complicated
part of this lecture.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.870
We'll go through it all pretty slowly.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.000
The first thing we're going to
do is we're going to back up

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:31.700
The first thing we're going to do is
we're going to backup the host file.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.800
To do that, we're going to set the
current directory to ETC.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.500
And then we're going to run this
command to make a duplicate of

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.020
the host file on your machine.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.990
The host file is used, for the most part,
on a Mac OS X machine to look

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.700
up names and resolve names.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.430
But with NetInfo and other
parts of the operating system,

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.070
it works together with them to do that.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.580
So the first thing we're
going to do is back it up.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.600
The next thing we're going to do is
we're going to change the permissions

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.970
so we can go in and edit that file.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.980
Has everybody caught up with me?

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.420
So the next thing we're going to do
is we're going to open the host file.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:25.360
And to do that, we're going to type this
command into the terminal,

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.780
openetc.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.540
And that's going to open a window
in the finder where we can go and

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.840
fish around and find the hosts file.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.380
You'll find a whole bunch
of other files in there.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:36.050
I'm not going to talk about those today.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.210
We're going to look through the file.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.260
We're going to find hosts and
drag and drop that into Xcode.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.140
and once you have that
file open for editing,

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.800
we're going to look for the
line that has local host in it.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.800
And we're going to change that to

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:12.800
[Transcript missing]

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.500
No white space, just as shown up there.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:23.060
You can use spaces or tabs.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.080
Tabs or spaces, they'll both work.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.960
As long as it's all on the
same line and it looks pretty

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.250
much like what I have up there,
you'll be fine.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.700
Does anybody else need
this for much longer?

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.540
Is that okay?

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:41.300
The next thing we're going to do is
we're going to activate the changes.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.740
Now, here,
we don't have to restart anything

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.100
for these changes to come into place.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.410
What we do need to do is I just like to
put the permissions back to the way they

00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:55.840
were before because of security reasons,
and I just consider it a good practice.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.160
So the first thing we're going to do
is set the execution directory to etc.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.160
We're going to change the permissions
back to the way they were.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.070
We're basically going to exclude
others from writing to this file.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.410
The next thing we're going to do,
and this is the long part.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.730
I'm very sorry it's very long.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.300
I thought it would be shorter.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:24.890
But this is the Apache configuration
to add to virtual hosts.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.900
The first line here is
going to write out a file.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.640
And we're using the sudo t command.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.110
I'm not going to get into
specifics of why I'm doing that.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.980
If you want to use bbedit
to write out a file,

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.980
all you have to do is save
it in the same directory.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.470
If you know how to do that, great.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.140
Otherwise, you can just type along.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:45.270
What you need to do here is basically
type in everything you see up here.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.190
The first line is going
to create the file,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.680
this part here.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.850
Name virtual host tells Apache, OK,
we're using virtual hosting,

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.700
and we're going to match any name with a
star and use that for virtual host names.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.620
We're going to do lookup with that.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.920
The first section is a
virtual host section.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.400
This is the default virtual host.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.930
If the name isn't
recognized by the system,

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.050
it's going to default and use
this as the default virtual host.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.630
The second section is actually
our WWDC example virtual host

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.580
that we're going to be using.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:23.300
Now, to go through the specifics here,
the first virtual host is bracketed

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:28.800
by very HTML-looking tags that
contain all the configuration

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.880
information about the host.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.430
If you read up on the
Apache configuration tags,

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.300
you can put almost anything for
configuring Apache into that section,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:43.430
such as server-side includes statements,
enabling PHP processing

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.000
inside of HTML pages.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:55.910
So the first part of this,
this is the name of our local

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.910
host and this is the directory

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:06.100
[Transcript missing]

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.360
The second virtual host block is the one
that we're actually interested in here.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.850
This is going to be our
configuration for our local host,

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.090
or our WWDC example host.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.800
And that's enclosed in
a virtual host block.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.710
And just like before,
you can add all the configuration

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.730
statements that you normally
would for a virtual host or

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.970
for any web server in there.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:33.300
The first line is our name, WWDC,
and the second line is our

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.020
document directory where we're
going to place our HTML files.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:45.060
Yeah, that's in the next part.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.560
Is that all done?

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.890
So if you're typing
this into the terminal,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:00.950
the very last thing to do to save it is
hold down the Control key or C-N-T-R-L,

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:07.380
not the Apple key,
and type the letter D or C.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.180
And that will basically end your input.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.100
Is everybody caught up with me or do
I need to wait a little while longer?

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.080
Okay, we'll give it another two minutes,
I'll bet.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:56.150
Now, you can come and talk to me later
if you need details about this.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.240
I'm just going to move on.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.290
If that's OK,
we've got most of everybody.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:23.000
[Transcript missing]

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.160
I put the wrong directory in there.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.940
We're going to have to type
library web server documents WWDC.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.700
I'm very sorry about that.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.100
And the next thing we're going
to have to do is restart Apache.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:40:02.500
[Transcript missing]

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:04.360
Thank you.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:04.800
Thank you.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.620
Okay.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.360
So, the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to create the directory

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.880
that we just made reference to.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.560
We're going to pair the
name WWDC together with a

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.300
directory on our machine.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.300
So,
this is where we create the directory.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.420
The next thing we're going to do
is we're going to restart Apache so

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.360
it reads in our configuration file.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.840
Now, if you made a typing mistake,
you'll notice that Apache is going

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.390
to give you an error message,
and it's going to suggest

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.860
that you run the config test.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.260
And that will give you more information
about exactly where the error is.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.190
You can go and edit that.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.160
After the session,
I have some slides showing you how

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.340
to undo those changes if you need to.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.280
Now we can test our local website.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:49.960
The first thing we're going to do
is we're going to create a file

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.070
to do the testing with inside of
our folder that we just created.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.300
So what we're going to do there is
we're going to go in the terminal

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:05.160
and we're going to set the execution
directory to web server WWDC.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.280
And then we're going to do
the same command as before,

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:17.100
basically, to save a small PHP script
into a file called phpinfo.php.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.320
The next thing we're going to do is
we're going to switch over to Safari,

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.540
and we're going to enter
the address http://.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:56.900
[Transcript missing]

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.400
And here we are.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.140
We're looking at WWDC.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.480
I'll go back in a second here.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.180
So there it is running on our machine,
if nothing less,

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.060
just to prove that it works.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.260
Can we go back to slides?

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.940
This is the slide here.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:15.680
OK.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.240
I'll just review.

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.930
What we're doing here is we're setting
the execution directory for our

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:27.360
commands that we're typing to the new
directory that we just-- or to the new

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.840
directory we just created for our host.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.710
The next command,
what we're doing is we're saving

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:38.620
a new web page to that directory
that we're going to display

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.120
in Safari in the next command.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.740
This command here,
we're displaying that in Safari,

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.350
and we're just taking a look at that.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.790
So we already did the hands-on part,
so I'm going to skip past that.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.630
So what do we do?

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.040
We created some virtual
host aliases on our machine,

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.740
and we edited the
configuration file for that.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.200
That's the bare minimum that you'd
want to have for doing local testing.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.170
I really like the idea.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.830
It's much better than trying to do
your testing on a live server that

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:11.060
many thousands of people are using.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.290
So, M.P.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.370
on Mac OS X.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:15.560
Thank you very much for coming.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.500
We talked about MySQL, PHP.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.520
We talked about what's installed.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.800
We went over some
configuration on Apache.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.760
We talked about setting up PHP.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.160
We talked about Marc Liyanage
and his website.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.870
He has installers for the
latest versions of his software.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:33.640
He does a good job of keeping that up.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.830
And we went over a configuration
for a local website for doing

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.860
testing on your machine.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.400
Here's some URLs that we talked
about during this session.
