00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.600
Happy Friday.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.900
Thank you very much for attending
the enterprise messaging session.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.160
My name is Michael McMillian.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.390
I'm one of the segment managers here
in Developer Relations covering the

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.030
groupware and messaging solutions.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.440
We have a really neat
session for you this morning.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.840
I'm going to introduce JD Mankowski.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.560
And JD leads our professional
services team here at Apple.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.800
And he's going to go through,
run through some of the third party

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.220
groupware and messaging solutions
that we have on the platform today,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.320
as well as end it with a couple
technical case studies with some

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.850
real life examples of people that
are using these solutions today.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.110
So with that, JD.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.470
Hello, those lights are shiny.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.240
Good morning.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.000
My name is JD Mankovsky.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.690
Like Michael said,
I run the enterprise professional

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.500
services team for the U.S.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.440
and we even extend to Tokyo quite often.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.190
So if you've seen the
Azora project on Monday,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.140
the deployment,
my team was really doing a lot of

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.450
work there in terms of Kerberos and
AD integration with Joel's help.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.250
So we do a lot of enterprise deployments,
XServe rate, XN.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.920
You know, we do a lot of just large
enterprise deployment around

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.500
our storage and servers.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.470
So we wanted to talk today about
enterprise messaging solutions.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.450
And it was funny,
I hope you guys all had a good

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.390
evening last night at the beer bash.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.160
So real happy to see you
guys here this morning.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.850
I know it's hard.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.850
I know it's hard.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.650
But, you know, doesn't it feel great
to still get carded,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.920
you know, when you get to the beer bash?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.040
It makes you feel younger.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.690
You call your wife or a friend and say,
hey, believe it or not,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.780
I just still got carded.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.160
So anyway, let's get going on the
Enterprise Messaging Solution.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.370
So first I want to kind of
give you an update on clients,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.170
Mac OS X groupware clients.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.870
And then we're going to
talk about more server-side

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.520
solutions around collaboration.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.390
And then we'll have two case studies,
two customers who have deployed

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.760
actually OS X server-based
collaboration solutions on the platform.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.260
So first,
what I wanted to do is kind of give

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.150
you an enterprise client update.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.820
And the first one I wanted
to talk about is Microsoft.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.490
How many of you here have
Exchange deployments in the room?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.560
Yep, it's a lot.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.840
So we wanted, you know,
Microsoft was kind enough to kind

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.860
of give us some slides on their
upcoming Service Pack 2 for Entourage,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.780
and we wanted to talk about that,
as well as a few other things.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.010
So first, as you know,
there's quite a few client

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.510
options for Exchange to connect.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.410
Most of you use Entourage 2004,
and again, we'll talk in a few seconds of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.240
what's upcoming in Service Pack 2.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.950
A lot of people on the IT side
use Remote Desktop Connection,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.030
Virtual PC as well, great product.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.630
And then for the OS 9 clients,
some of you still run Classic and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.120
are running Outlook 2001 for the Mac.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.700
How many people here still
run Classic and Outlook 2001?

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.450
Yeah, so very minimal, so probably 10,
15 people in the room.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.350
And then, of course, Outlook Web Access,
just great for, you know,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.960
when you're on the road
to connect to your email.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.900
So this is the interface, of course,
through Outlook Web Access.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.470
You know, it's a good interface.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.540
The... The nice thing that
we've put together with the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.060
Active Directory plugin,
I don't know if you've ever set that up,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.580
but it's great.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.360
You can do single sign-on through
Safari using the Spinego security API.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.540
So, you know,
you should be able to just single sign-on

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.820
right through your Outlook Web Access if
you're using Safari and have the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.980
Active Directory plugin set up properly.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.140
So it's kind of neat.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.930
Remote Desktop Connection,
this is the interface.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.350
A lot of IT people I know,
a lot of Windows IT people that

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.500
are now carrying PowerBooks,
and they're managing all their

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.660
PCs and all their services.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.910
servers through remote
desktop connection.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.640
Entourage 2004.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.340
So this product shipped last year and,
you know, that's part of the 2004,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.400
Microsoft 2004 suite.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.440
And, you know, it does a lot of things in
terms of email synchronization,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.230
calendar,
address book via the web dev protocol,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.640
you know, scheduling,
form-based authentication support,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.200
you know, some core delegation,
but there's more to come.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.930
This is the interface you can see here,
you know, very standard interface.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.600
In this case,
we're basically setting up a meeting

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.270
amongst multiple people with,
you know, free busy support.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.060
So, in Office 2004, you know, again,
last year, I don't know how many

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.670
people came to this session,
but there was a lot of great feedback

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.400
that was given to the Microsoft team
in terms of missing features in the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.720
first release of Entourage 2004.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.480
And, you know, we're really happy because
Microsoft has been,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.140
you know, the team has been really
hard at work in delivering,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.200
you know, an awesome service pack 2
release for Entourage 2004.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.330
And we actually have two of the
Microsoft people here in the room.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.180
They're sitting right in
this corner over there.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.990
And they'll be glad to, you know,
take some of your questions, you know,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.740
after the session.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.120
You can go and talk to them.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.370
They really want to hear
your feedback in terms of,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.190
you know, even more functionality
later down the road.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.850
So what's coming in
Service Pack 2 is faster syncs,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.580
more calendaring support, public folders.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.420
So there's been some issues with
public folders where some mount,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.480
some don't.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.960
And they've definitely improved
the public folder support.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.460
Mail quota usage.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.020
So I hear that a lot where you've
got mail quotas on the Windows side,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.920
but that doesn't work on the Mac side.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.340
So mail quota support.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.310
Browseable Global Address Books.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.740
So that's another great feature.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.100
Sometimes it works, sometimes it didn't.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.100
So that's in there.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.100
Great.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.490
And by the way,
they actually have a great article,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.880
I don't know if you've seen that,
but if you go to their

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.100
tech article library,
they actually have some information on

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.100
how to integrate our address book as
well within a Microsoft AD environment.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.920
So you should definitely check that
out as well because some people like,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.040
in terms of icing support or you name it,
it's just great to be able to use

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.920
the Apple address book as well,
as well as the Microsoft address book.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.900
Multiple Calendar and
address book support.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.980
So that was a big feature.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.230
Conversation grouping as well as
sharing permissions on mailbox

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.820
folders with another user.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.670
So this is a short list of
the upcoming features that are

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.100
going to be in Service Pack 2.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.370
So again, for more information,
Microsoft will be announcing this product

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.930
in the second half and shipping this
product in the second half of 2005.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.320
So go to their website.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.220
I'm sure you'll see a lot of
press release around this as

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.940
soon as it's made available.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.020
If you're interested in perhaps getting,
some of you might already

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.100
be seeded with a product,
some of you who aren't,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.080
please talk to your Microsoft rep.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.100
I mean, I'm sure they'll be there.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.460
I'm sure there's ways for you
to get access to the software

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.100
and test it internally.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.360
So if you're a big enterprise
shop and you definitely use,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.100
you have a lot of Macs and you use
Exchange and you use Entourage,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.410
make sure you talk to your Microsoft rep
and get on the list for upcoming

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.100
seeds or newer seeds down the road.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.100
I mean,
we have a lot of customers who do that.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.010
So if you're not on the list,
please make sure to get on it.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.240
On the server side,
the requirements are very simple.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.100
You have to have an Exchange 2000
server with service pack 2 minimum.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.790
I'm sure pretty much everyone
is running that except the ones

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.540
that are still running 5.5.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.240
And then you've got to have
Outlook Web Access enabled.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.150
Of course,
WebDAV must be enabled and then LDAP.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.710
On the Microsoft Messenger side,
Microsoft is also hard at work on the

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.700
Messenger 5.0 product for the Macintosh.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.860
And again,
that's going to really add a lot

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.700
of value in terms of collaboration
amongst Mac and Windows users,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.670
and that's something that was
missing on the Mac platform.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.150
And Messenger 5.0 is
going to have some great,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.700
more secure real-time communication
built into the product.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.690
And again, that will also be available
in the second half of 2005.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.740
How many people here use Messaging?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.940
Okay, excellent.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.740
So some of the new features:
improved security,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.140
live communication server support,
just better integration in terms

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.940
of address book integration,
and tab viewing,

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:45.730
as well as a new and improved
user interface to take advantage

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:45.730
of the Mac OS X look and feel.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.610
And on the server side requirement,
you'll need the

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.170
Live Communication Server 2005
Service Pack 1,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.950
as well as support for the
Live Communication Server 2005

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.070
Public IM connectivity.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.950
And of course,
separate CALs are required for that.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.980
So, I mean, you saw it at the keynote,
you know, on Monday when Steve announced,

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:19.130
you know, Mac OS X for Intel,
running on Intel.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.180
You saw that, you know,
Microsoft is there.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.570
I mean, they've committed to having
the full Office suite on

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.120
native on Mac OS X for Intel.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.720
And you saw the commitment
from Adobe as well.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.760
So, you know,
really we're very happy with

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.790
the partnership and how things,
you know, the relationship between

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.860
Microsoft and Apple.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.820
And they, you know,
they continue to develop, you know,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.600
some great products.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.860
You know,
I've been to the Mac BU in Cupertino.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.860
I mean, it's an awesome team that works
really hard on great Mac products.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.220
So, you know, they're really to,
they're ready to listen to your feedback

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.170
if there's more feedback in terms of,
you know, better support and better

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.900
integration with Mac OS X.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.140
Some of the resources available
off the Microsoft website,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.500
you know, Microsoft.com/exchange,
Microsoft.com/mac.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.020
Most of you are probably
familiar with those URLs,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.180
but I just wanted to make
sure to put those up there,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.180
because I know there's a lot
of new people in the crowd

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.760
that this is their first WWDC.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.820
So, again, just some great URLs,
and those will be made

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.100
available through ADC as well.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:26.900
The second big client deployment
that we have is IBM Lotus Notes.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.820
So I wanted to talk-- give
you an update on IBM as well.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.500
Current status.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:38.220
So as you know,
they released last year 653 and 654.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.340
653 added Active Directory support.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.640
There was a bug previously where AD,
and there were some issues with AD.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.140
So they fixed that in 653.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.130
They actually even released a 654.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.120
And that fully supports Mac OS 10.3.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.720
and they have a 655 that's upcoming
that will fully support Tiger.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.900
and they also have a Note 7.0
that is in beta right now.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:10.920
It's in beta 3 and that can be downloaded
off the lotus.com/ldd link that you

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.320
see at the bottom of the screen here.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.460
They also, like I said,
they have the 7.0 coming with same time

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.680
presence awareness that will be built in.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.840
They're all going to have
a Lotus Team Workplace 7.0.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.320
So right now they're at, I believe,
at release version 6.5.1.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.780
And they're going to add Safari support
for both the Team Workplace as well

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.390
as the Lotus Domino Document Manager.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.620
And so both of those will fully
support Safari in their next release.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.900
and then their Workplace
Collaboration Solutions,

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:55.810
Workplace Management Client will be
also upcoming with Mac OS X support.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.510
And here's a screenshot of
their lotus.com/ldd website.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.280
So they definitely have a lot
of information off that URL,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.350
so please check it out.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.780
So let's give you an
update on Novell as well.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.080
Well, I mean, the good news is, you know,
Novell is cross-platform.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.850
So, you know, many, many years ago,
there was a lot of issues where

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.500
Groupwise was -- there was some
features on the Mac that were not,

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.710
you know, on par with the
Windows version and so forth.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.390
Now they've gone, you know, all Java.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.980
So, you know,
really it's a cross-platform client.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.460
And it's available, you know,
through -- they have an IM client.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.800
They have a Web Access client.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.140
All those just run today on Mac OS X.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.530
So there's not much to announce.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.150
They do have a Sequoia
-- their code name,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.800
Sequoia release, which will be coming out
in the summer of 2005.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.480
and for resources around Novell,
please check out their product

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.370
page and some of their cool
solutions at the following URLs.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.800
So that's a quick update
on the client side.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.700
And what I want to spend the rest of
the presentation is talk about server

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.200
solutions around the Mac OS X platform.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.820
And the two products that we've had
really good success with within the

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:25.200
enterprise are the Cario product and
the Stalker CommuniGate Pro product.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.770
And those are two solutions,
two server-based solutions that

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.100
run on Mac OS X that run on XServe.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.600
And we definitely have
a lot of customers.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.440
We've deployed quite a few
Cario solutions over the past 12

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.980
months for medium-sized business.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.960
And customers have been, you know,
very happy.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.300
And Cario is always hard at work
in adding new functionality.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.450
So, you know,
if you haven't talked to them,

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.760
they're actually in the data center
and they've been there all week.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.200
So I strongly recommend
that before you leave.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.760
I think the data center probably
closes around 3 or 4 today that

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.140
you go and talk to them and see
what their product has to offer.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.460
And we'll talk about their upcoming
release in just a few seconds.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.020
But really, Cario Mail Server 6 is a
complete collaboration solution.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.510
We've had newspapers that
were running Exchange 5.5 and,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.780
you know, they were getting hacked.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.890
I mean, it was pretty bad.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.940
And so what they decided
to do is simply migrate.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.200
They've got this great migration.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.820
They've got this great migration tool
that migrates all your Exchange mail

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.200
into this Cario Mail Server.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.200
And it supports full calendaring
as well as full email support.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.950
On the PC side, you load a Mappy adapter.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.200
And the PC people,
the PC clients keep using Outlook.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.220
And on the Mac side,
they fully support Entourage.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.580
So you can just plug in your Entourage
right into this Cario backend and get

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.200
access to your calendaring and your,
you know, your free/busy and, you know,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.220
the stuff that you're accustomed to with,
you know,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.190
an Exchange 5.5 or 2000 backend.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.200
So they do share contacts,
share calendars.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:10.220
They've got built-in anti-spam and
anti-virus built into the product.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.150
You know,
the pricing is really interesting.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.220
And they fully support IE as well
as Safari for the webmail interface.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.220
Webmail interface is very, very rich.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.200
And if you look at some of the reviews,
PC Magazine, you know,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200
best small business mail server of 2004.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.040
So again, they target small to
medium sized business.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.790
They've got over 7,000 customers
and over 400,000 mailboxes.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.020
They're based in California, Santa Clara.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:44.920
Founded in 2001 and about 50% of
their sales are Mac OS X Server sales.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:50.500
And what's kind of also very neat is it's
a simple download for you to test with.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.000
And by the way,
the 30-day evaluation also

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
fully includes support,
which is kind of neat for a company

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.150
to offer free support for 30 days.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.300
That's kind of a nice thing to have
when you're evaluating a product.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.430
The admin mail interface
is absolutely gorgeous,

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.030
and it runs on Mac, on Linux,
and on Windows.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:17.300
So it's very, very nice, very rich,
and very simple to administrate.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.900
And of course,
another nice thing they added

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.660
is they added full support
for AD on the back end,

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.400
because most of you are
not-- if you have AD,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.600
you're not going to move off of AD.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.880
We understand that.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.890
And they also have full support
for Apple Open Directory built in.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.790
So again, a few features they support.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.420
They support the email client
look and feel on Safari,

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.640
drag and drop messages.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.080
Through the web interface,
you can actually drag and drop

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.200
messages and drag and drop mailboxes.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.110
Out of office reply, junk mail,
and then that entourage

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.470
connectivity that we talked about.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.160
They have an upcoming product,
which is in beta right now,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.230
that you can download at this beta URL,
the beta_section.html.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:11.140
And their 6.1 release will support iCal,
Firebird, Sunbird, Calendar support,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.200
a MAPI connector.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.060
What that means is, again,
they already have a MAPI connector,

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.400
but now they're going to have an
offline MAPI connector support built in.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.380
SyncML for people who use SyncML phones.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.530
Free/Busy support built in
through the webmail interface.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.320
They had Free/Busy on the FAT clients,
but now you can actually

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.940
set up a meeting,
a Free/Busy meeting,

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.700
through the web interface.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.800
Anti-spam and also two antivirus.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:43.860
You can actually have two antivirus
engines running to totally eliminate

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.600
antivirus and anti-spam through

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:52.550
and And then later down the road,
later this year, they're hard at work at

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.140
supporting XAN support.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:59.140
So we can actually build a really
nice cluster-based mail server.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.440
'Cause redundancy is important,
we understand in the enterprise.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.750
And so we've been telling them
that they need to add XAN support.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.810
So they're already pretty hard
at work in adding XAN support

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.120
with Kareo mail server.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.690
And that'll allow it to scale to
much larger numbers down the road.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:26.700
Resources, again,
if you just simply go to Cario.com,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:26.700
you know, from there you can see all the
different products they have.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:26.700
And again, they're in the data center,
so please go and talk to them.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:34.040
The second product that I wanted
to talk about is Stocker Software.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.800
and their product is
called Communigate Pro.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.240
And Communigate Pro has
been around for many,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.800
many, many years.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.850
And again,
they really-- Communigate developed

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.420
some pretty high-end mail solutions.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.190
Their target are ISPs, telcos,
large education,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.170
large enterprise markets.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.560
They have over 9,000 customers
and 60 million active users.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.600
They're also based in California.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.270
They have offices in Japan, Germany,
and Russia as well.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.440
And they've supported
the Mac over 11 years.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.010
And they have over 1,600
customers running on Communigate.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.950
Again, they support their
standard-based email solution,

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.640
but they also have calendaring,
scheduling, real-time communication.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.870
They even have voice over IP.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.900
They also support SIP.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.240
So you can actually deploy,
communicate solution,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.290
and have a full SIP phone
deployment with that solution.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.640
So it's really more than
just email and calendaring.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.300
It's really a full
solution for an enterprise.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.350
They also have some advanced security.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.840
They fully support SMIME encryption,
even through the web interface.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.050
And they've got this
web-based administration tool.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.790
Some people like it, some people less,
but most people like the web interface.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.100
And again, it's flexible.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.660
It supports dynamic cluster,
active-active,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.810
through an NFS cluster or even with
a built-in or with an additional

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.790
cluster file system underneath it.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.300
You can build a pretty powerful
clustering back-end server solution.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.790
And what's interesting is
they run on over 30 platforms.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.300
So that's pretty amazing.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.930
Mac OS X, Unix, Linux, Windows.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.800
Of course,
we want you to run on Mac OS X.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.380
That's probably why you're here today.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.980
and then they also have an
encrypted message store as well.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.630
So your messages,
even though they're stored

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.100
on a large storage array,
those messages are actually encrypted

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.040
on the storage backend as well.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.880
Again,
they support a large variety of clients.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.600
They have iCal support.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.210
They're adding Entourage support in the
version 5 of the CommuniGate Pro product,

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.210
which we'll be shipping later this year.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.000
So they're also hard at
work on their next release.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.460
And of course,
they have Palm support as well for

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:03.600
people who definitely want to read
their emails through their PDAs.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.720
Documentation.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.100
Again, they've got a lot of
documentation off their website.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.700
They've got some great
white papers available.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.390
So you should definitely check it out.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.990
And if you want to contact them,
Mark Freberg is a great resource.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.400
He's Director of the
Channel Sales for CommuniGate Pro.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.470
And you can get in touch with
him at mfreberg@stalker.com.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.590
So what I want to get into now is
some technical case studies where we

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:37.140
have some customers who are actually
running Cario and CommuniGate Pro.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.110
So we wanted to bring over
first the Children's Hospital of

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.880
Oakland Research Institute,
Ben Hanes, who's a senior systems

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.900
analyst over there.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.050
And they're going to talk
about their mail deployment.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.610
Ben?

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.340
Thanks, JD.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.340
Having a great time here at WWDC.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.500
I hope all you are as well.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.380
By show of hands,
how many guys are in IT now?

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.320
Okay.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.920
And how many of you would rather
be doing something different?

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.930
Okay, that's because we enjoy what we do,
right?

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.810
And we like to engage in new challenges
and find new solutions to those

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.710
challenges and keep it interesting,
keep it fun.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.820
So the Children's Hospital and
Research Center at Oakland is

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.560
one of the largest,
busiest,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.630
and most comprehensive medical center
between Los Angeles and Seattle.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.790
For over 90 years,
we've been providing top notch

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.640
medical care for children
in the region and beyond.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:56.020
The Children's
Hospital Oakland Research Institute,

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.120
which is where I work,
has 43 principal investigators,

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:05.200
over 300 basic and
clinical research staff,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.760
and an annual budget
approaching $50 million.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:18.110
We do a lot of research
on pediatric diseases,

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:23.710
but a lot of our investigations
do benefit patients of all ages.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.580
So to give you an idea
of our infrastructure,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.530
we've got over 400 users,
and we maintain that

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.920
with a staff of three,
I'm one of them.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.790
We've got a completely mixed environment.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.480
We've got essentially half of
our systems are on Macintosh,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.480
and half of those are on
Windows with a few Linux.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.060
And IREX is kind of mixed in.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.760
And we really find that
this is a real good balance.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.200
It poses some very
interesting challenges to us.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:57.600
And it gives us a lot to work with,
but we do enjoy it quite a bit.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.640
And especially with the
tools that Apple provides,

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.830
makes it really,
really good for us to be able to

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.580
administer our Macintosh environment.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.260
And along with the remote desktop
connection from Microsoft as well,

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:17.310
we're able to maintain this large number
of computers with our small staff.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:24.020
We do a lot of cross training
between our IT staff.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.880
We essentially focus on a
particular project and show

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.700
each other how to maintain that.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.610
We generally support everything
from desktop and AV support all

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.700
the way to the research acquisition
and deployment of new systems.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:49.080
Our main focus, our main goal,
is to provide the computer tools that

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.520
allow for scientific discovery so that
our researchers and our scientists really

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.960
have the tools that they need to get the
job done and not try to impose any of

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.700
what we think their computers should be.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.690
We really let them make the
decisions on what they like to use.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:12.840
I'm the lead Macintosh manager dealing
with high level Mac desktop support,

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.070
Mac OS X Server,
and of course the email server.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:21.550
Now we looked at getting
a new email system.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.500
There are a few things that we
looked at that we wanted to conquer.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.130
Since all of our funding
comes from grants,

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.300
60% of which is from the
National Institutes of Health,

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:37.060
we really needed something that would
allow us to communicate with all of our

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.960
collaborators and our administrative
staff and we needed something

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.590
that was going to be bulletproof.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.900
Something that was going to be up all the
time and never have any problems with it.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:52.370
We also wanted to make sure that the
system that we chose used open standards.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.700
We didn't want to tie ourselves
into a proprietary system.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:02.840
So that we can have a lot more options
for what we choose to mix with and also

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.960
give us more options in the future.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.360
So when we're looking at what we needed,
the first thing, of course,

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.990
we want to make sure that we were
protected from malicious attacks,

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.950
virus attacks.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.220
And of course,
Apple has essentially proven themselves

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.350
to be very good in this area.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.650
We wanted to make sure that we picked
a solution that had essentially

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.320
proven itself in the market,
something that was a solid system

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.500
a lot of people were using.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:42.320
We looked at Exchange initially and
because of these things that I mentioned,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.500
we started engaging in
discussions with Apple.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.570
They suggested that we look
into Communigate and we're

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.000
very happy that we did.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.150
We started talking to those guys.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.960
We specced out a system from them,
including the rack, the UPC, the cables,

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.000
the entire package, including training.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.880
We didn't actually even need
any consulting teams to come

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.000
in and show us how to do this
because it was easy enough to do.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
We looked at about $60,000.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.370
When we looked at a comparable
system from Exchange,

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.650
and that would include a
lot of consultant help to

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.900
help us tie it all together,
it was about $600,000.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:28.000
So essentially it was
a no-brainer for us.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.990
We did also look at the cluster
solution from Communigate,

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.980
and it does cost quite a bit more.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.100
And we knew that it was going
to be tough to convince our

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.170
finance committees that that was,
you know,

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.000
that we were just going to spend
a whole lot of money on it.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.570
So we designed sort of a scale solution,
a stepwise solution where we

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.840
would get the single server,
and then we could migrate

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.000
up to the dynamic cluster.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
And because of the
scalability of Communigate,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
it was trivial to do that.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.990
So that's the direction
that we took so far.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.570
And so far, you know,
the single server has been

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.000
doing quite well for us.

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.970
After we got the system, of course,
our first task was to migrate all of

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:17.570
our users from our existing email server
at the time we were using Groupwise.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.160
The CommuniGate Pro provides a
really great command line tool

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.260
to migrate everything using IMAP,
so we just moved all the mail over.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.040
We also grabbed a third party tool
from Wingra Technologies that allowed

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.130
us to take the address book calendar
that was in the Groupwise system

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.220
and import it into a PST file.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.410
We then put that into Outlook and
people copied over the data that they

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.760
needed into the CommuniGate Pro system.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.800
We did engage Stalker for
training for our IT staff,

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.020
so we're all very well versed
on how the system works.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.330
This was several days of training
and they did a great job there.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:03.000
Also, went to the Apple training
for Apple certification.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.030
They provide some fabulous training.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.020
If you ever get a chance to go
down there and do the training,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.200
I definitely recommend it.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.420
Then we had to train our
users on some of the nuances,

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.340
on the differences.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.590
Mostly it was, "Hey,
here's some features that -- here's

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.090
some things you couldn't do before and
now you can do so much more." It was

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:27.300
really exciting for us and for our users
to be able to engage in that dialogue.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:32.070
And then about a year into it,
it's been about two years since we've

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.000
had this system and about a year into it,
we engaged with the

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.410
Apple consulting team.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.010
JD and his team came out and
helped us set up a failover

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:46.500
solution with the XServe RAID.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.910
And we now have a nice system
that is sort of on the direction

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:55.570
towards the cluster that provides
essentially about a 20 second downtime,

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.500
which is pretty good for us.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.500
Our users don't even notice it.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.500
The pager doesn't go off,
which is really nice.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:06.510
I do get an email and appropriate
action is taken the following day or

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.500
whenever we are able to go deal with it.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.580
But since we're running off of
a stable server at that point,

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.390
we can kind of deal with it
in the way we feel necessary.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:32:06.800
[Transcript missing]

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.470
Thank you, Ben.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.280
So now I'd like to introduce
Jeff Butterfield from

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.970
George Lucas Educational Foundation.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.600
And Jeff is going to talk to us
about their carrier deployment.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.080
Thank you, Jeff.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.520
Great.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.590
Thanks.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.060
Thank you.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.400
Good morning.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.400
Let's see,
figure out how this clicker works.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.400
So probably a lot of you
have heard of George Lucas.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.400
He has a project out this summer.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.400
Herbie Fully Loaded.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.400
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.460
We get to discover how good
Herbie becomes bad Herbie,

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.400
which I'm looking forward to.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.400
But not many people have heard of the
George Lucas Educational Foundation.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:53.400
We were started in 1992 with a focus
at that time on educational technology.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:59.920
Then in about 1995,
we kind of examined what we were

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.860
doing and we changed our focus to talk
about trying to bring the innovative

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.930
educational programs and some of
the things that were happening in

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.400
isolation out to the whole community.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.280
So primarily,
when you say nonprofit to people,

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.400
they really don't know
what you're talking about.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.280
So to make us more accessible,
think of us as a media organization.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:26.320
We publish CD-ROMs, DVDs, textbooks.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.230
Our main publishing
vehicle is our website.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.400
We have edutopia.org.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:38.400
We have,
I think it's over 500 articles now.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.710
And it says 100 here,
but I think it's over 120

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.980
web documentaries online.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.300
Last year, or excuse me,
about two years ago,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.790
George went to one of these
chain bookstores with the

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.380
really large magazine racks.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.800
And he came back from that and he said,
you know, I was looking at all these

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.690
magazines and there was not
one magazine about education.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.050
Fast forward a year,
we're publishing a new monthly

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.300
magazine called "Edutopia."

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.010
So let me talk a little bit
then about the foundation,

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.950
because we've really changed
a lot in the last year.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.600
Currently we have 30 users.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.820
We have an IT staff of three,
which when I saw Ben's slide and it

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:33.360
said 400 users and three IT staff,
I went back and yelled at my people.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.910
We look terrible.

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.660
But actually we're not really IT people.

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:42.560
My title says Director of IT,
but that's kind of fudging a bit.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.560
One of my IT people is
really a Flash developer.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.560
He does a little IT support on the side.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.270
My other IT person,
she's more of a database

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.400
sales force engineer.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.400
We do a little IT on the side.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.910
Personally myself,
I do PHP and MySQL and a little

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.490
bit of FileMaker and compression
and XHTML and CSS and a little

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.370
bit of IT support on the side.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.520
I'm probably the closest thing we
have to a traditional IT person.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.100
we have to a traditional
systems administrator.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.690
"I cut my teeth ten
years ago on Sendmail,

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.700
but as you can probably guess,
I don't have time for that

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:26.310
kind of thing anymore." So our
environment is made up largely,

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:30.440
because we're sort of a
media academic organization,

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.200
we have primarily Mac users.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.230
Like I say, a lot of them come from
schools of education,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.200
a lot of them now come
from print media houses.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:47.190
We have a lot of our people on
the road at conferences like this,

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.200
or educational conferences,
NEC is a big one coming up.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.940
So we have a lot of people on laptops.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:59.550
We also have a wide
variety of email clients.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.790
When we were smaller, this was okay.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.890
People coming from academia
started using Eudora or

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.820
Mail App or Outlook or whatever,
and we didn't want to

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.800
interfere with that.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.460
Whatever they used,
that they were comfortable with,

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.120
that was okay with me.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.800
We're still doing that, but we'll see.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.600
As we get larger, obviously,
that becomes more complicated.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.090
So when we started the magazine,
this magazine has to be self-supporting.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.480
It costs a lot of money
to produce a magazine.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.430
And we had to hire a lot of new staff.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.880
And some of the new staff
that came in were salespeople,

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.300
which as a nonprofit,
we never had salespeople.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.480
And the salespeople came in and
they had certain expectations.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.090
A lot of them came from organizations
that had Exchange servers.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.720
And I went out, like Ben,
and priced Exchange servers.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.730
And that really wasn't going
to be an option for us.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.850
But these Outlook users had
things that they needed.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.600
They wanted calendaring.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.680
They wanted to still use Outlook.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.860
They wanted to use their PC laptops.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.300
And so in trying to accommodate that,
I needed,

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.300
I needed to come up with a solution.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.590
And as I sort of mentioned,
we were largely a Mac house.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.400
So what did I need?

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.570
I needed to find something
that would run on our Xserves,

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.400
because that's what we were using.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.350
It needed to have all the capabilities
I'm sure you're familiar with:

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.400
anti-spam and anti-virus.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.250
Now with more Windows users
than I was used to having,

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.400
the anti-virus was more
critical than ever.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.620
But what was really key for me
was I needed for my other two

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:48.400
IT people to be able to administer
this email server really easily.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:54.400
These were people without any real
background in mail server administration.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.300
And I needed to go on
vacation at some point.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.170
So I really needed them to be
comfortable with the interface.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.290
So that's what happened.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.050
We brought it in.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.760
It worked for us.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.870
The Outlook users are very happy.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.360
As far as they know,
it just works the way they

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.840
were used to using it.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.440
But what was new for our Mac users
is all of a sudden we have these

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.730
sort of enterprise level features
that we didn't have before.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:28.260
And that was a big sea change for us.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.670
Calendaring became much more important,
obviously, now that we went from the

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.620
staff of 15 to 20 people.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.100
So bringing those folks in and
making everybody feel like we can

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.440
collaborate but still use our respective
email clients without interrupting

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.760
our workflow was quite a trick.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.440
One of the things I've really
grown to appreciate Cario for

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.780
this year is web mail access.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.100
I don't know how many of you,
about six months ago,

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.760
SBC Global and somebody else--
I can't think of who it was--

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.780
started to block port 25.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.420
Port 25?

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.130
SMTP?

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.920
Is that right?

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.500
All of a sudden,
nobody can send mail from home, which,

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.180
as I mentioned,
I've got a lot of home users.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:19.910
So that web client became
much more critical for us.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.440
So I'll pass this back to JD.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.050
But let me just take a moment to say,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:32.540
enterprise level is finally starting
to come for the smaller users.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.240
And that's a real treat for us.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.340
So thank you to Apple and
Cario for providing that.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.450
Thank you.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.970
So in summary, what we wanted to kind of
touch on is you've heard a lot

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.820
about Tiger Server this week.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.760
And running the consulting team,
we hear a lot of customers who are

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.740
looking at collaboration and instant
messaging within their enterprise.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.670
And I strongly recommend that you
really look at the iChat Jabber server,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.060
because AOL,
and they tried doing that a few years

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.750
ago selling the IM Server Solution,
and it was very expensive

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.420
and really never took off.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.280
And Apple really took it,
integrated it into the server,

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.700
puts this great interface on top of it.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:22.040
And the integration of Jabber
Server with OS X makes it very easy,

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.710
even for the people who
are big window shops,

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.640
to take one or two Xers
and integrate it with your

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:33.660
AD backend or your LDAP backend,
and have this great cross-platform

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.920
messaging solution that is
secure within your enterprise.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.560
And give the opportunity for your
users within your company to-- to

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:49.120
message and collaborate together without
sending all that confidential data

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.980
through AOL or someone else's servers.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.010
And we all know we don't want to do that,
and a lot of you block

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.540
those ports already.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.200
But let's give them the opportunity to
actually work and collaborate together.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.590
And the Jabber server is just an
awesome product that's built into Tiger.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.660
So we strongly recommend
that you look at that.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.710
And there's Jabber clients for Linux,
there's Jabber clients for Windows,

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.270
so it's a really nice solution.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:18.950
The WebLock server is another feature
that is great for sharing data.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.540
I mean, you know, this is a big thing.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.490
I mean, every time you know you have
information and you know what,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.880
you're so busy during the day,
you can't share it with the rest of your

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.750
company or with the rest of your team.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.720
And having a WebLock server up
there when you learn something

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.920
new and you want to post it,
it just makes it a lot easier.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.810
And that's, again,
built into the product.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.300
Directory services integration,
you heard a lot about that this week.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.920
Again, you know, with AD, with LDAP,
even with, you know,

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.130
Linux back-end directories,
it just makes it a great

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.610
platform to run on.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.680
And it's secure, which is, you know,
definitely very, very key.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.630
And then, again,
with some third-party products

00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:00.090
like Carrier and Communigate,
you know, if you're a small medium to

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:04.810
larger enterprises and you want
to look at a Mac OS X solution,

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.520
running your mail and
your collaboration tools,

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.520
you know,
we strongly recommend that you look at

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.130
those and give us some feedback as well.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.790
You know,
we have an enterprise IT feedback

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.980
forum this afternoon at 1:00 for those
of you who are in enterprise and you

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:24.520
want to give feedback to Apple on how
we can do better in the enterprise,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.780
please go over there.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.200
If you do go to that session,
you will miss my advanced backup session,

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.560
so that is the unfortunate thing.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.890
But if you do have feedback,
please go over there and give it

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.600
to our -- to the Apple people,
the executives that will be

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.670
there for that feedback session.
