WEBVTT

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.700
Good morning.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.850
Welcome and thank you for coming.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm Paul Kopacki.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.000
I manage the ADC web team.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.990
I'm here to talk to you about
how to be a power user of the

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.690
Apple Developer Connection.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.240
This is a topic that's really important
to me and to all my colleagues,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.740
'cause we work very hard to make
the Apple Developer Connection

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.700
valuable to you as developers.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.360
So it's very important to us that
you utilize it to its fullest,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.860
all the things we do.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.540
We want you to get the most out
of Apple Developer Connection.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.530
And...and I don't have a clicker.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.700
Can I just do this?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.930
I can.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.160
So what is Apple Developer Connection?

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.520
It's a set of programs designed
to meet the needs of different

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.800
parts of the developer community.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.570
It's your way to interface with Apple.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.800
It's your way to partner with us,
to work with us, to communicate with us,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.800
to get our help and support.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.800
That's what these programs are all about.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.880
And we've got a variety of
programs at different levels,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.170
from the online program,
which is free and primarily focused

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.900
on providing information resources,
to the top-of-the-line Premier program,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.170
which includes a ticket to your
favorite conference in mind,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.800
WWDC.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.200
We also have a student developer program,
which is aimed at college and university

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.990
students and helping them become the
next generation of great Mac developers.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.760
Oh, there's my clicker.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.800
I forgot that.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.750
So, inside these programs are many,
many benefits and services and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.650
resources that should be useful to you.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.000
There's content, there's great content,
great technical content, support,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.990
ways to communicate with us,
ways to access the developer community,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.660
training.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.800
It just goes on and on.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.300
It really is a lot.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.380
It's a little bit overwhelming,
or at least that was the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.800
intention of that build.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
But there's a lot there.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.800
We're not going to cover it all today.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800
It's way too much to
cover in one session.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.370
We're going to just hit some highlights,
some things that we know

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.480
you need to know about,
and that'll make you more

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.800
successful developers.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.090
And I encourage you to explore all of
these other features after the session.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.200
And behind all this, behind the programs,
behind the features, are the people.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.180
I took some time to just tally up the
number of full-time people associated

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.920
with Apple Developer Connection,
either within developer relations,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.280
within software engineering,
other parts of Apple.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.650
And it was more than 200.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.540
It was almost 200,
and I probably missed a few.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.980
So that's a sign of Apple's
commitment to the developer community.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.020
Like I said, all of these people,
it's really important to us that you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.940
utilize the Apple Developer Connection
to the fullest so you're

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.040
successful on the platform.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.080
The one thing all these
people have in common,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.510
many varied talents,
many varied different

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.200
kinds of experience,
the one thing they all

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.370
have in common is... is...

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.130
Focused on Developer Success.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.080
And to get back to my original question,
what is Apple Developer Connection,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.340
that really is at the core of it.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.940
We are focused on developer success.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.240
That's what we're all about.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.390
So that's what I'm here
to talk to you about,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.650
hopefully make you a power user
of the Apple Developer Connection,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.060
get more out of what
we're providing for you.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.810
So let's go over the agenda a little bit.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.660
Powerful new technologies
like universal binaries,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.910
Xcode, Core Data, Core Image, Spotlight,
these create great

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.700
developer opportunities.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.060
You guys know that.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.250
But they also create great
developer information needs,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.150
and you know that as well.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.180
So the first part of our presentation,
we're going to talk about

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.130
how you can keep up to date,
how you can use the information resources

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.150
that the Apple Developer Connection
provides to keep you up to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.660
date and current with all the
latest technology information.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.240
And then continuing on that theme,
we're going to talk about how Xcode and

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.800
the ADC Reference Library integrate.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.340
ADC members have always
had great access to Xcode.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.460
The latest releases have been
easily available and quickly

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.500
downloadable to ADC members.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.430
And with the release of Xcode 2,
the connection between Xcode

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.580
and ADC got even tighter,
in that the ADC Reference Library is

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.400
now tightly integrated within Xcode.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.850
So we're going to do a little
demo up here to show you how

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.300
some of those features work,
and we're going to explain

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.630
how it's great to be,
it's better to be both an Xcode

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.280
user and an ADC member together.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.040
After that, we're going to bring up
my friend Mike Korte.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.680
He's a developer within the ADC team.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.890
So he's going to talk to developer
to developer about some of the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.710
really big benefits we provide,
things like pre-release

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.010
software downloads,
technical support, compatibility labs.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.280
Probably you know a little bit
about some of these benefits,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.540
but he's going to talk in depth
about what we're doing there.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.610
These are things you really
need to be taking advantage

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.610
of to make the most of ADC.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.790
And last, ADC support doesn't end
when the coding ends.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.980
We have a lot of programs,
a lot of marketing services

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.780
available to help you be successful
in business and in the marketplace.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.840
It's more than just coding,
as you all know.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.630
You've got to make a
living at doing this,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.730
and ADC goes out of its way to provide
benefits and services that will help

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.790
make you successful in the market.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.500
So with that, let's get started.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.820
If there's one thing that I want
you to take away from today,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.000
one thing would be to visit
this page at least once a week,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.800
ideally a couple times a week.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.260
Why?

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.400
Because if there's any new information
for developers that exists,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.810
if there's any new information or news,
it's going to be on this page.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.730
If there's new sample code,
if there's new documentation published,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.600
you can find out about it here.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.880
And if there are any new
ADC benefits or features,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.060
services that will be useful to you--
and I can tell you that we have a

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.780
few new ones that are in progress,
and you should see us roll out soon--

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.460
you're going to find out about them here.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.720
So this is really the place to visit.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.790
It's just a web page, easy to visit.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.900
I'm going to take on a little tour of it,
though, just to show you how,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.460
with about 60 seconds spent on this page,
you can be sure that you're up to date

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.010
and current on what's going on with ADC.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.700
So the first thing I'll call your
attention to is the banner graphic.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.610
This gets the prime
real estate on the page,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.700
and this is where we
put our Uber message.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.920
So right now, the Uber message is well
known to all of you,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.700
because you're here at WWC and you
heard Steve say it in the keynote.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.640
That's the ultimate
Uber message platform.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.460
But every week is not WWC week.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.920
There's 51 other weeks of the year,
and we use this space to

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.660
get across the big message.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.640
So it might be about WWC, launching,
special pricing on membership programs,

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.700
other offers like that.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.650
Obviously, this is a five-second thing.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.700
It's going to catch your eye
if I'm doing my job right,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.620
and it's a good way to see sort of the
big things we're trying to tell you.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.920
And that was not supposed to happen.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.680
Battery?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.200
Maybe I should take the
battery out and put it back in.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.310
That works for me sometimes.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.160
Okay, having a little technical
difficulties here.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.570
They're working on it back there.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.640
I'm getting hand signals
I can't understand.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.790
So it's a little like karaoke up here.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.360
Can you put the police back on?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.640
Because I know all the
words to all those songs.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:38.720
He's doing what I said.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.710
He's just switching the batteries.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.700
[Transcript missing]

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.300
Is keyboard going to work?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.180
Mouse is not working.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.610
Houston, we have a problem.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.920
Still not working.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.280
Yeah.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.230
That didn't work either.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:38.000
If I'd known this was going to happen,
I would have prepared some jokes.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.900
Okay, all right.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.740
Cool, thank you.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.500
Sorry about that.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.740
So the next thing I want
to call your attention to,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.250
the 60 seconds you spent on
this page gets a lot longer if

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.400
you have technical problems.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.640
Your mileage may vary.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.620
The next section on this page
I want to call your attention to

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.420
is the feature content section.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.940
This is where we publish
technical articles.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.020
We publish about a new
article every week,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.580
usually on Monday or Tuesday.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.490
A quick scan here to see what the
latest articles are is a great

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.110
way to keep up on some nice,
light reading,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.280
some key technology topics.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.560
The articles here,
they're generally short.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.880
They're written in a very casual
developer-to-developer style,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.340
tend to be easy reading,
and they're almost always focused

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.600
on developer opportunities,
new technologies to explore,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.570
new ways of using existing technologies,
teaching you things hopefully that

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.540
you may not have known about or
may have known about but hadn't

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.000
thought about quite this way.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.280
We also do some developer
success stories here,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.680
too.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.400
So if you're doing something
really interesting with

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.520
technology on our platform,
we may do a success story about you.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.160
So a quick scan here.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.550
If there's anything you're
interested in and you have the time,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.500
click through and read it.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.020
If not, bookmark it for later.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.690
Next up is headlines.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.340
It is what it is titled.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.890
This is where we put the
news headlines of the day.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.070
The latest documentation
and sample code is here.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.460
This is something we've heard again
and again from developers is that many

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.900
developers said they have these mental
maps of the resource collections.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.510
So they really want to
know when something is new,

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.740
when something is added.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.710
It helps them add them
to their mental map.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.440
And then they know what's in the library.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.020
So a great thing to do is just
check the headline section.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.720
At the top,
you see a little section which we

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.280
call the hot topic section internally.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.820
Sometimes we call it Hot Pockets,
but that's another story.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.980
Here is a place for other news
that isn't really banner worthy.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.280
These are temporary links
that wouldn't otherwise have a

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.750
permanent link on the home page.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.860
So you can see WWC is there and
the Tiger Developer overview,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.810
a few other things.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.400
And then below,
a whole load of documentation

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.350
was published this week
right after the keynote.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.590
And you can see the
beginnings of it here.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.930
So also on the page,
you'll see in two different places

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.420
those little blue lozenges you're
seeing all over the Apple web

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.600
kingdom and all around the web.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.740
These are our RSS,
links to our RSS feeds.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.340
If you're not using RSS,
I recommend you check it out.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.200
It's an alternative to visiting websites.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.910
Some people like it.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:17.590
Some people like to use a newsreader,
like Net Newswire.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.590
That's a cool way to do it.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.460
What you get is you get
basically just the headlines,

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.760
and you don't get any of my pretty
graphics or any of that other stuff

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.670
I spend so much time on on this page.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.760
But it is a great service,
and if you're using Safari,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.560
one of my favorite features in
Safari 2 is the RSS feature,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.680
which lets you get an RSS view
of any of these pages.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.360
Basically, it clears away the clutter and
you get straight to the news.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.400
I'm pleased to announce that this week
we rolled out topic-specific RSS feeds.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.100
Again, this was in response
to developer requests.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.090
We've been told that, you know,
developers say, "Hey, you know what?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.650
I know Java stuff is important,
but I'm not a Java developer.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.920
I'm a Cocoa developer.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.140
When you tell me-- you
give me news about Java,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.990
it's just noise.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.150
What I want is Cocoa.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.960
Maybe I want graphics and imaging." Well,
topic-specific RSS feeds are a way

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.830
to just focus in on what are your
specific interests and to filter

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.530
out the stuff that might not be
relevant to what your work is.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:11.560
So that's it.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.840
That's the 60-second
tour of the home page.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.850
When you're done with that,
you're up to date, you're current,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.490
you know what's going
on in the ADC world,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.890
you know what's going on in
terms of Mac development,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.560
it's probably time to start working.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.140
So this is a page-- I've
got to stop doing that.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.230
This is a page where, as I said,
it's a jumping-off point

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.510
to all ADC resources.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.260
So if it's time to start researching your
next project to check out technologies

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.100
that you might want to build into
your app or to learn something new,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.510
we really provide two ways to
get in deep on the technologies.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.380
The first are the Topics pages.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.040
The Topics pages,
they provide the broad overview.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.290
They give you the context
for the technologies.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.430
They tend to be aggregated
pages with lots of links to

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.120
all of Apple's resources,
as well as sometimes

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.540
third-party resources.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.040
You'll find links to
the mailing lists here,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.500
related resources, that sort of stuff.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.940
It's a great place if you're
coming cold to a technology,

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.040
you don't know much about it,
you want that context,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.060
you want to understand how it relates
to all the other technologies.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.560
And what it might do for you,
how you might use it.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.740
The alternate path, though,
is to go straight to

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.790
the Reference Library.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.100
This is, again, another thing developers
have told us again and again.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.340
Many developers prefer to go
straight to the sample code,

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.120
straight to the API doc.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.300
That's the way they
rock a new technology.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.980
They want to see the code,
they want to see the API reference.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.410
So Reference Library is the
quick way to get to there.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:15:28.300
[Transcript missing]

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.600
Thank you.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.100
Hello.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.550
My name is Melina Kirsch,
and I'm a writer in Apple's

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.330
Technical Publications Department,
and I want to talk to you a little

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.600
bit about the ADC Reference Library,
what it is, and in particular,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:47.130
how you can take advantage of it
within Xcode to find and access

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:52.590
information quickly and easily so
you have all you need to know about

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.600
Apple's APIs and technologies.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.600
So, first,
what is the ADC Reference Library?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.320
Well,
it's an integrated collection of Apple's

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.600
technical resources designed to help you
learn about and adopt Apple technologies,

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.760
and it includes a number of
resources such as documentation,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.600
tech notes, Q&As, release notes,
and sample code.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.760
So, currently,
there are over 2,200 documents

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.020
in the Reference Library,
not including our legacy

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.590
technology information.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
And, you know,
I'm going to talk a little bit

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
about the ADC Reference Library.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
So, first,
what is the ADC Reference Library?

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
Well,
it's an integrated collection of Apple's

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
technical resources designed to help you
learn about and adopt Apple technologies,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
and it includes a number of
resources such as documentation,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
tech notes, Q&As, release notes,
and sample code.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
So, currently,
there are over 2,200 documents

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
in the Reference Library,
not including our legacy

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.600
technology information.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.410
And they're available
in both PDF and HTML.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:35.640
That's over 3 gigabytes of technical
information for you to research

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.840
and implement your project.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.040
And we're constantly adding and updating
the ADC Reference Library content.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.000
For Tiger,
we added over 200 new and updated

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.340
documents and pieces of sample code.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.050
Just this week, we added another 100
new and updated pieces.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.150
So that's a lot of information for
you to sort through when you're

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.110
trying to get your job done.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:03.350
Well, to help you find answers quickly,
get on with your coding,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.880
stay focused on your code,
we've integrated the

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.140
ADC Reference Library with Xcode.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.630
What does this mean for you?

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:13.190
Well,
it means that you can browse and search

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.800
documentation without leaving your code.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.210
Xcode supports both quick
API lookup to get you directly to

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.930
the documentation for a symbol,
as well as several types of

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.350
full-text search to help you find
things with more general queries.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:33.590
And there are also shortcuts from
the code editor that let you do these

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.280
searches directly from your code.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.180
Of course, I mentioned that we're
always updating the content.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.320
Well,
how do you know that you have the latest

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.290
and greatest information in Xcode?

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.280
We supply downloadable
documentation updates for this.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.730
So every time we refresh the content
on the ADC Reference Library online,

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.620
we also make an update available.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.690
Xcode can automatically detect when
one is available and notify you.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.360
So all you have to do is log in,
download it.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.670
Your local content never gets stale.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.950
You always know that what you have
in Xcode is the same thing that's

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.700
on the ADC Reference Library online.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.470
So, by default,
we do not actually install all

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.310
three gigabytes of information
on your local machine.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.840
That would be excessive.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:29.250
So, to help you find and access all
this information from within Xcode,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.180
Some documentation, such as sample code,
Xcode lets you choose where you want

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.600
it to look for that information.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.910
So, for example, you can go to the web,
that's the default behavior,

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.530
or you can have it use the
ADC Reference Library DVD.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.090
So if you're on an airplane,
or you don't otherwise have

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.950
an internet connection,
you can have it look

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.900
for documentation there.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.090
So that's a brief overview
of the features of Xcode.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:03.010
Now let's take a little closer
look at how you might go about

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.940
finding information in Xcode.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.210
So I have here a very simple project.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.900
It's actually a standard application
template that you can use with--

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.850
that you get for free with Xcode.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:23.090
And it's a core data application,
and it uses a spotlight importer.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:32.000
So, as developers,
you probably spend most of

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.700
your time in the code editor.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.940
So let's start there.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:41.110
I have here a very simple function that
you also get for free with the project

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:48.300
template that grabs metadata from my core
data document for use with Spotlight.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.340
So the interesting thing
here is probably this method,

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.240
metadata for persistent store with URL.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.220
How do I learn more about that?

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.300
Well, I can do that simply by selecting
the method name and choosing help,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.380
Find Selected Text in API Reference.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.060
You'll notice that Xcode brings up
the documentation window and performs

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.450
an API search to take me directly to
the documentation for that method.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.180
You can also do the same
thing from the code editor,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.130
using Option + Double Click.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.760
So now that I'm here,
I may want to find more information about

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.720
other symbols declared in this class.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.220
You may be familiar with
Xcode's function pop-up.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.880
Well, the documentation window
has something similar.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:43.030
I can use this pop-up menu to see all
of the symbols documented in this page.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.680
So to jump to any one of them,
I simply select it from the menu.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.910
Xcode takes me right there.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.680
So I can find information on
any symbol simply by typing

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.300
it into the search field.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.530
So let me do another one.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.600
Object for key.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.670
You'll notice that as I type,
Xcode filters the list

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.420
of matching symbols.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.650
Of course,
you'll see I have some Java symbols

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.940
as well as Objective-C symbols.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.580
Well, for example,
I'm an Objective-C programmer,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.500
and I may want to focus only
on the Objective-C symbols.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.670
Xcode lets you add additional
documentation filters so that

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.040
you can focus on the results
that are most relevant to you.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.980
So in this case,
if I want to filter out the Java symbols,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.870
I click the "Configure Options" button,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.770
Deselect the languages
I don't want to see.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.140
Click OK.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.530
And now you'll see that all
I have are Objective-C symbols.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:53.100
So far, I've been focusing primarily
on reference material.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.080
But what if, for instance,
I wanted some more general

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.240
information about a subject?

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.300
For example, Spotlight is relatively new.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.070
Well,
Xcode also supports full-text search,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.200
several types of full-text search.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.790
By default, it's an exact match search.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.980
To perform a full-text search,
I select full-text search from the

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.600
search menu and just type in my query.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.820
In this case,
I'm going to look for metadata.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.590
Hit Return, and I have my search results.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.070
So there's some interesting stuff here,
but you'll notice I also have some

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.480
hits in the QuickTime API reference.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.890
Those may not be
particularly relevant to me.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.670
I've actually been searching the entire
ADC reference library this whole time.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:43.760
I can further narrow my search, however,
according to the technology categories.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.190
And these are the same categories
that Paul was mentioning earlier.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.940
In this case, I want to focus on Cocoa,
so I simply select Cocoa in

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.000
the search groups list.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.140
And I can perform my search again.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.160
And now I get a much more
focused set of results.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.580
Including a tutorial on using
Spotlight with Core Data.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.040
You can select it,
go to the documentation, scroll down,

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.070
see it's got a lot of great
content and some code snippets.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:21.320
So, another thing you might be
interested in is sample code.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.760
In particular,
say I'm interested in finding

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.660
out what new and updated sample
code is available for Cocoa.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.970
Well, to do this,
I'm going to click the Back button.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.830
New in Xcode 2.1,
the documentation window now has back

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:41.980
and forward buttons that function just
as your regular browser buttons do.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:48.360
It was a request we heard often.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.910
So that takes me back to the reference
library landing page for Cocoa.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.460
And I'm going to use the Jump To menu
to take me directly to the sample code.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.330
So here I am, and I'll scroll down.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:05.440
I see in the new and updated sidebar that
there's some fairly recent sample code,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.490
and I can click one.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:12.110
As I mentioned before,
sample code is not installed locally.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.850
So, in this case,
Xcode takes me to Safari and goes

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.400
to the ADC reference library online.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.950
Well, for instance, what if I were,
you know,

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.140
traveling somewhere and I didn't have
-- I did not have Internet access,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.100
but I did have a DVD.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.310
Well, I can have Xcode use that DVD.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.470
And to do so, let me go back to Xcode.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.500
I just open up the Preferences window,
and in the Documentation pane,

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.780
there's a table, Extended Locations,
and this is the list of all

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.660
of the locations that Xcode
uses when it accesses content

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.700
that it does not find locally.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.560
So to add a location,
I simply click the plus button,

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.660
select my DVD,
select the ADC Reference Library folder,

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:00.700
and click Add.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.590
And of course,
I want Xcode to look at this DVD first,

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.570
before going to the web,
so I drag it to the top.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.130
Xcode actually looks at these
locations in the order in

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.700
which they appear in the table.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.700
So I'll click Apply to apply my changes.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.700
I can go back to the
Documentation window.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.700
And now you'll notice that when
I click on the sample code,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.200
it opens within the Documentation window,
because it's accessing it from the DVD.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.180
So the preferences window is also
where you set your preferences

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.460
for documentation updates.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:44.650
You can have Xcode check weekly, daily,
or monthly, or you can check manually by

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.340
clicking the "Check Now" button,
which I'm going to do.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.280
So this is the notification that you see
when a documentation update is available.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.760
If you click "Download," it'll take
you to the ADC member site login,

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.500
where you can log in, get the download,
and install it.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.980
I am not going to show you that now,
in the interest of time.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.770
One last thing that I want to show
you is a feature that we've just

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.410
added to the ADC Reference Library.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.900
I'm going to go back to
the documentation page.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.380
We really hope you find
what you're looking for,

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.700
but sometimes you might not.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.180
Well, we've just added links to all
of our documentation pages

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.990
for you to give us feedback.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.700
Scroll to the bottom and you'll see
that there are a number of links here.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.900
And to give us feedback,
you can report typos, inaccuracies,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.700
or tell us what you would
like to see more of.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.120
So to do that,
you just click on the link that describes

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.620
how you felt about the documentation,
and it takes you to a page

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.540
similar to the following,
which you can fill out

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.800
and then send to us.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.170
We review this feedback daily,
and in fact,

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.630
a number of the documents that
we released with this latest web

00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:00.150
update incorporated some of the
feedback we've already received.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:06.300
So, I encourage you all to go and tell
us what you would like to see,

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.100
what you liked, what works for you.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.040
We're constantly trying to
improve the ADC Reference Library,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.200
and this is your chance to help us
make it better and ensure that you

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.880
have the information that you need.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:27.110
So, that was a short tour of the
ADC Reference Library in Xcode.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.440
There are a number of features here
that we hope make you more productive,

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.490
help you find answers quickly,
so that you can spend more time coding

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.000
and less time looking for documentation.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:39.830
And with that,

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.060
I would like to...
Can we switch the slides,

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:43.620
please?

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.280
Thank you.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.800
With that,
I would like to bring out my colleague,

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.960
Mike Korte, who is here to talk to you
about other ways in which the

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.700
ADC can help you be successful.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.130
Thank you, Melina.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.580
Hi, my name is Mike Korte.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.490
I'm the systems architect for
the Apple Developer Connection,

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:12.700
and I also lead the team of engineers
who work on the ADC member site.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.070
Before coming to Apple,
I was an in-house developer,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.550
as well as a third-party developer who
was shipping a shrink-wrapped product,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.520
and I'm going to talk today about
some of the other ADC benefits that

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.840
I've used throughout my career that
I know will help make you successful.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.490
Um.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.660
Paul and Melina have talked
about the ADC Reference Library,

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.160
and that can help you most of the
way to complete an application.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.200
But there are those times when
you reach a certain point at which

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.810
you can't figure out a problem,
or it just doesn't make sense

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.730
for you to spin your wheel,
spend your time trying to

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.400
figure out the problem.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.620
This week you've been able to go up to
engineers in orange shirts and tap them

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.860
on the shoulder and ask a question.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.710
Wouldn't you love to do that year-round?

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.700
Developer technical
support lets you do that.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.440
When you have a developer
technical support incident in

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.770
your ADC member site account,
you can email a question

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.500
to DTS@apple.com.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.850
That email can, of course,
include any attachments,

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:17.290
like sample code or code
snippets or a sample application

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.520
that illustrates your problem.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.320
That email will be routed to
the appropriate DTS engineer.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.260
DTS engineers are experts in their field.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.410
Not only that,
they can bring to bear all of

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:36.620
Apple's operating system hardware
engineering as well as other technical

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.860
resources to help solve your problem.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.090
The support incidents aren't
just to the conclusion,

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.030
aren't just a simple question
and answer where you ask one

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.580
question and you get an answer.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.590
There can be a dialogue back and forth.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.690
It's to the satisfactory
conclusion of your issue.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.290
With the technical support
and the reference library,

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.560
you can complete an
application and successfully

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:15.940
The other half of creating an
application is the testing.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.980
You need to test on all of
the hardware and software

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.900
that your customers will have.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.550
Where do you get all of those versions,
for example, of the operating system

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.900
that you need to test on?

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.170
The developer downloads of
the ADC member site is your

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.900
access to all of that software.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.880
When you have a seed key in
your member site account,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.900
you have access to all of the release
versions of the operating system.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.900
Currently,
that's from 10.2 through 10.4.1.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.880
You also have access to other software
that can help in your testing,

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.900
such as XSAN or WebObjects
and other software.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.900
But more importantly,
when you have a product,

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.740
you need to be testing your
current applications on software

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.900
your customers will have.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.900
And the ADC member site is where
you can come to get the ADC software

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:01.900
that you need to test on.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.900
You can come to get versions
of pre-release software.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:11.370
How many of you were testing with
Spotlight or Core Image or Dashboard

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.900
before the release of Tiger?

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:18.830
We started seeding Tiger last November.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:24.970
So if you're truly taking advantage of
what an ADC membership has to offer,

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.080
you're using your seed keys,
you're getting to your engineers,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.900
and you're helping them get the
software they need to test your

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:30.900
applications and be successful.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.460
The other half of testing is
testing on the hardware that

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.900
your customers will have.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.540
We all go through the develop
test cycle on our local machine,

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.870
testing on the OS and testing
on the hardware we have.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.820
And the hardware discount program
gives your company access to

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.900
a limited amount of hardware.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.800
But you can't possibly maintain an
inventory of all the past hardware

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.900
that your customers might have.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.900
Oh, sorry.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.900
I skipped the whole flagship section.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.730
We know that downloads
are important to you.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.290
So last fall,
we upgraded our developer download

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.850
network to a content delivery
network with worldwide coverage.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:21.230
We also switched from FTP to HTTP so
you can do restarts in Safari as well

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.890
as use your preferred download manager.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.720
This investment in you has allowed
us to serve over 150,000 customers.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.900
We've also been able to deliver over
156 terabytes of developer downloads.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:38.370
Just this week, since the keynote,
we've served over almost

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:43.880
19 terabytes of data,
peaked out at just shy of 3 gigabits,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.900
which is about like an Xcode
download every 2 to 3 seconds.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.790
So we're real happy to
provide that to you.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.820
So as I was saying,
ADC compatibility labs.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.890
Give you access to a wide
variety of Apple hardware.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.890
There are labs in Cupertino, Tokyo,
and Beijing.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.900
The labs in Cupertino
are the flagship labs.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.900
They have the most hardware
with over 200 systems.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:17.760
Everything from the original
beige G3 Power Mac through the

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.900
latest 2.7 gigahertz Power Macs.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:26.900
They also have a complete collection
of high performance computing hardware.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.540
XServe, XServe Cluster, X-Rate,
as well as the software that

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.890
goes with that such as XSAN.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.590
When you book time in the labs,
you can ask for certain configurations,

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.800
combinations of hardware and software.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.940
All of the versions of Mac OS X,
both the US versions as well

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.630
as the international versions,
and then all of the

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.500
Apple software like iLife,
iWork,

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.850
and all of the Pro apps for your testing.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.890
I encourage you to visit the
labs while you're at the show.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.900
They're on the other hall.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.900
And I know that between
the reference library,

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.900
the developer technical support,
developer downloads,

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.720
and the ADC compatibility labs,
if you're taking advantage of all of

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.970
those things that the ADC has to offer,
you'll create truly

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.890
successful applications.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.900
But ADC doesn't just stop with
those technical resources.

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:19.700
Here to talk about some of the business
services and go-to-market services

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.290
ADC has to offer is Ed Preysic.

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.960
Thank you, Mike.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.200
I'm Ed Prasek, Senior Manager of
Developer Business Services in

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.040
Apple's Worldwide Developer Relations.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.970
And, you know,
the one mantra of everything we do

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.950
in Developer Relations is helping
you be as successful as possible.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.060
You guys have spent a ton of time
developing your applications,

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.080
and they're great applications,
and we want you to be as successful as

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.290
possible in the marketplace and earn
a really good livelihood from that.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.470
We're not talking just a little.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.550
We want you guys to make a lot of money.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.020
Lots of it.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.000
Your success helps determine our success.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.060
The more successful you are,
the more you can continue to come

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.020
out with the great applications
that you have over the years for

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.150
the platform and continue to do so.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.410
And, of course,
that's what continues to drive

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.970
the platform to greater heights.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.700
Some of the things that we have available
to help you do that starts with,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.000
say, coding services.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.100
You guys might be a smaller developer,
don't have a lot of

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:26.730
engineering staff on hand,
or you might be a developer from

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.650
another platform looking to bring your
application over to the Mac platform,

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.830
and you need some services.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.840
Well, we've hooked up with some of the
industry's leading engineering

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.850
firms to help you do your coding.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.960
And the best thing about these guys is
they really understand the Mac platform.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.300
They understand the Macintosh experience.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.320
They understand what
customers are looking for.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.500
The Mac is more than
just the machine itself.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.770
It's about the experience,
as you guys know.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.320
They really understand how to deliver
that to the customer and really

00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.350
make sure that your customers are
experiencing the true solution experience

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.590
that the Mac platform has to offer.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.350
The best thing is that we've
negotiated discounts with

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:06.950
these firms for all you guys.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.900
So all selected Premier members
can take advantage of really

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.910
good discounts from these firms.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.050
So you got your code written, it's great,
everything's ready to go,

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.450
and now it's time to
deliver that interface.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.440
Well, you know,
you guys may be brilliant at the coding,

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.930
and you all are,
but not everyone's a graphic artist

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.500
or an interface artist or knows
how to design the best icons.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:32.760
And the interface is equally a
specific type of experience when

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.280
they're using the applications,
and the look and the feel that that

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.140
application provides is paramount to an
application's success in the marketplace.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.810
So again,
some of the industry's finest provide

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.300
their services at discounts to you
guys to make sure that that application

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.440
that you've been working so hard
on delivers exactly what you were

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.800
intending to deliver to your audiences.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.830
And like I said, again, discounts for the
selected Premier members.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.400
So you got your application finished,
and it's time to deploy it.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.780
Where are you going to deploy it?

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.140
Is it going to be just in your local geo,
or are you going to

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.710
look to do it worldwide?

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.680
If you go worldwide,
you're not going to want to

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.800
just do language translation.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.800
You want to make sure that you're taking
advantage of the cultural differences

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.890
of the geos that you're going to be
distributing your product through.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.590
And again,
we have some more firms here that

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.690
specialize in making sure that
your application is translated and

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.160
localized for your specific geos
and are in accordance with the

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.900
user experience that Mac users are
accustomed to in those specific geos.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.900
Some of these firms have been in
the Mac platform for a long time.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.780
Others are relatively new
coming into the Mac platform,

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:46.790
but they really understand the
geographies where the Mac platform

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.900
is relevant and emerging.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.900
So take advantage of it.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:55.270
And again, these are all discounted
services for you guys as well.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.410
And that's just the tip.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.950
There's over 140 different
programs that you can select from,

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.330
and all of these programs come
with a discount and provide

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:09.340
you everything you need,
from customer tech support, you know,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.720
you can have a company do your
third-party tech support for you,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.730
to electronic product retailing,
to CD replication,

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.900
to complete inbox fulfillment,
and inventory control management.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.710
You can learn everything you guys need
to take your product from concept,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.590
through to coding,
through to distribution,

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.850
and into retail is available
for you to take advantage of.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.700
And once you get into market,
one of the biggest things you can

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.730
do for yourself is the Mac logo.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.700
You know,
customers are walking through a store,

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:42.070
there's thousands of products in a store,
and how are they going to know your

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.040
product is what they're looking for?

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.420
They're not going to spend
much time reading the

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.000
information that's on the boxes.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.500
The Mac logo is one of the
best things you can do.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.370
Put the logo on the box,
it immediately tells customers that

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.260
are looking for your products that,
"Yep, I'm the product you're looking for,

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.310
I run on the platform," and it's a
great program to take advantage of.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.780
It's free, and the artwork is all online.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.500
You just have to sign
a licensing agreement,

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.930
download the artwork,
put it on your boxes, and away you go.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.180
You can also use it on your website,
and we encourage you to.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.040
If you do electronic retailing, again,
don't make your customers read about

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.680
whether this is the application for them.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.300
Give them that visual identifier.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.760
Let them know that, "Yep, this is it."

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.850
Another thing is the
Macintosh Products Guide.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.800
You know,
one of the biggest things about the

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.130
Mac platform is when customers buy a Mac,
they're coming back to Apple to find

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.690
out about information on products that
they want to use on their platform.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.900
The Macintosh Products Guide gets over
47 million users a year who are coming to

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.190
find information out about your products.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:49.540
It's available in six versions: UK,
Australia, Japan, Germany, France,

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.700
and Germany.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:56.690
And it's a great way for you
guys to get exposure for your

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:00.580
product under Apple's umbrella.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.700
It's free to put your product in.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:06.050
You can go to the home page of the guide,
and there's a link right there that says

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.310
"Developer Product Submission." Go there,
submit your product,

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.700
and the whole world then has
access to your product information.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.880
It also has an ad program
you can look into to use the

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.690
Macintosh Products Guide as
a great marketing vehicle.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.900
Again,
under Apple's umbrella to make sure

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.670
you're getting the word out about
your product to your customer base.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.550
Another good thing is new arrivals.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:32.200
This is an electronic newsletter that
we publish biweekly that lets the world

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.910
know that your new product has arrived.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:45.230
Almost 600,000 people view this document,
and they're constantly looking for what

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.000
are the newest things from Mac OS X.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
They're hungry for it,
and especially now with Tiger,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.410
what are the new applications that
are taking advantage of those new

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:53.990
technologies that Apple put into Tiger?

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.980
This is a great way to let them know.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.000
The attach rate from this is huge.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.560
The customers come in,
it's well over 50%. They click on

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.620
these products and they go back to
the developer's website to find out

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.000
specific information about those
products and how they work for them.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.500
Another great program we
have is if you're in retail,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.400
is Hot Deals.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.060
Hot Deals is something we have set
up with our major retail partners,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.700
and it gets over a
million viewers a year.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:25.060
What it is,
is it allows... we've hooked up with

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.850
our retail partners like CopUSA,
AudioMidi, Sweetwater,

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:35.190
some of the Mac Zones, Mac Connection,
and we say, "Look, give us great deals on

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.790
our developers' products.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:41.500
We'll promote those to the world via the
web." And that's what Hot Deals does.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.000
It's free to retailers, it's free to you.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.930
Customers actively come to this thing,
and the click-to-purchase rate

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.800
is 32%, which is astounding.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.380
The industry average is .1 to
.2% click-to-purchase rate.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.900
This is a 32% click-to-purchase rate,
which is unheard of.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.670
Some of the retail partners
in Hot Deals get as high as 45

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.890
to 50% click-to-purchase rate.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.780
So it's something that is
great to take advantage of.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.800
If you're in the retail channel,
go to your retail partners and say,

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.800
"Look, I want to take advantage of
Apple's Hot Deals programs.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.890
They'll let us know what your offer is,
we'll throw it on the page,

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.900
and then we take care of
marketing it to the world.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:20.660
The world will know about it,
and they flood that program and take

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:27.360
advantage of those deals." Another thing
is Mac OS X downloads on the Apple.com.

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.890
It's one of the most popular
sections of the Apple.com website.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.790
Again,
people are... they just can't get enough

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:37.890
of the new products that are coming
out and information on those products.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.810
They're hungry for it.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.900
It's your products.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.900
A million people a day go to this thing
looking for information on new products.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.900
And over 200,000 of them
download those products.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.890
It's demo-ware, it's trial-ware,
it's free to you guys.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.900
It's a huge marketing benefit that
you should be taking advantage of.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.750
Marketing doesn't have to cost you guys
a lot of money to be very effective.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.880
200,000 people a day are downloading
your products to take advantage of it.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.990
So make sure you take advantage of it.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.740
advantage of it.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.860
And then the last thing I want to touch
on really quick is the Apple Store.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.300
One of the biggest
questions that we get is,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.690
"How do I get my product
in the Apple Store?" Well,

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.120
there is no one hard
and fast answer to that,

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.300
but if you do have a product that you
think would be really good in the store,

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.280
we want to hear about it.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.260
When you submit your product to
the Macintosh Products Guide,

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.280
there's a section right in there
that says that you can fill out

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.300
to have your product considered
for inclusion in the store.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.740
And every week,
our retail team is culling through

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.300
that list and picking out products that
might be a great fit for the store.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.240
And not just one or two stores,
but our worldwide stores.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.300
So if you're interested
in being in the store,

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.300
that's the single best way to
start taking advantage of that.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.000
And we've covered a lot of
different programs today,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.300
and there's tons more.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.120
And instead of having to remember all
bunch of different URLs or scavenging

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.010
through the entire developer website,
there's a quick start page you can

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:04.260
go to and have links to all these
programs and dozens and dozens more.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.300
So take a minute and write that down.
