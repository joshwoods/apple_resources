WEBVTT

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.400
I'm John DeTroye,
Senior Consulting Engineer for Apple.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
I'm the Client Management Specialist
and this is not a repeat

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.400
of Wednesday's session.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.490
What we're going to talk about for
the next six or seven hours since

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.200
you stayed is we're going to talk
about the client management stuff.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.280
For those of you that missed it
on Wednesday or were sleeping

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.100
or didn't get it the first time,
I'm going to very quickly go

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.120
through the system lifecycle,
task list, and so forth.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.760
But the key for this afternoon's session
really is I have two really cool people

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.660
that are going to join me up on stage,
or I'm going to send up on stage,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.730
and I'm going to go over there
and nap for about 40 minutes.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.940
I have Steven Doyle,
came all the way from Australia to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.180
talk to you about all the awesome
stuff that he's doing with client

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.890
management and help desk tools.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.890
And James Reynolds came not quite
as far from Utah to talk about what

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.400
they're doing out at the university
out there for client management.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.040
The focus on this afternoon is going
to be on the open source stuff.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.470
We did commercial stuff on Wednesday,
and yes, Richard, I got your hint.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.880
You know, that's the whole deal.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.390
We'll combine it and do maybe everything.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.940
Next year.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.180
But then from the feedback
session that we just went through,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.790
I got a feeling that you guys would
really like me to be doing hands-on

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.250
client management from A to Z next year.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.680
Now to torture those of you
that aren't in education,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.390
I will let you know that for those
of you that are in education,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.790
if you contact your account execs
and tell them you would like

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.280
a free walkthrough for six or
eight hours on client management

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.360
with me leading the charge,
all you have to do is contact

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.600
your account exec and because
I work in the education division,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.540
I can go and do that.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.000
For those, well for the enterprise guys,
you have to beg a lot harder,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.020
but I'm sure we can make it,
we can make something happen.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.760
I mean, you know, I travel.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.800
I have United Miles and Hilton
Honors Points so we can do that.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.800
So, lots of them.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.910
The, so, anyhow, let's get on,
let's get going for this afternoon,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.800
we'll have some fun.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800
What is the system life cycle?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
What, you know, what is all this stuff?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.800
This is stuff you guys do all the time.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.790
How many of you saw this on Wednesday?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
How many of you haven't
seen it at all yet?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.800
How many of you are doing email
and you still haven't seen it?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.940
The whole, there's always somebody in the
audience that's just got to,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.800
the whole idea is this is the task that
we go through from an IT perspective.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.770
The things that we have to
accomplish on a regular basis.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.580
We have to go through,
we cycle through all the, you know,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.800
bring in the hardware,
bring in the software, evaluate it,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
deploy it, manage it, evaluate it,
deploy it, manage it.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.790
And it keeps cycling around
in how we deal with it.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.700
We cannot escape from this.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
The tasks that are required.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.800
The tasks that are associated with this.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.800
These are things that you might ignore,
but they still exist.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.770
We cannot get away from the fact that
we have got to do asset management.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.800
We have got to do imaging.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.800
We have got to do software distribution
above and beyond those two things.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.800
We've got to do remote
control tasks of some kind,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800
whether it's in training
or help desk or whatever.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800
We've got to do usage
management of some sort.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800
We've got to do license management.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.910
We definitely need
patching and upgrading,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.800
despite the fact that
we ship our software.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.740
the fact that we ship our OS in
the most perfect state possible.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.330
The, it's all that third party stuff.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.080
The, and we do help desk management
even if it consists of the t-shirt

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.860
that says let me drop what I'm
working on and handle your problem.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.300
Okay.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.670
Evaluation.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.150
We go through this at least
once a year in education and

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.780
sometimes every six months,
sometimes once a week in some businesses

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.890
where you have to look at what do
I have to do to maintain my status.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.190
I'm looking back at everything
that's been going on.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.040
What do I need?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.140
How much manpower?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.080
What's happening in my world?

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.990
How do I perform these tasks?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.340
And the last bullet is
pretty much universal.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.610
The deployment side,
all the things that I have

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.940
to do to get this stuff out.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.100
I mean, what am I going to do?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.900
How many system images
am I going to maintain?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.090
You know, it's great to think about
a universal system image,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.430
but it never works out.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.250
You always end up with unique images
based on different criteria and so forth.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.370
How many systems am I deploying
as I walk through these cycles?

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.680
How do I get through this?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.010
And how much of this deployment is
things that I'm going to do manually

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.960
or am I going to do it network
wise or we just run around and say,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.510
here, quick, grab the firewire drive
and run down the hall.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.300
It happens.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.160
Or you could be up in the state
of Maine where we did it at 244

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.500
distinct sites with nothing but
firewire drives to 27,000 computers.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.400
And by the way,
to get to one of the school districts,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.200
you had to fly on the mail
plane as the co-pilot.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.220
Yeah.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.200
It was fun, actually.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.140
The, well, I'm an ex-paratrooper, so,
you know.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.700
They wouldn't let me jump.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.490
The,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.650
Hey, no.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.070
And the whole idea of how long
it takes to cycle through this.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.980
I mean, imagine right now if
somebody came back and said,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.530
you know, we've been troubleshooting all
the machines in our building

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540
for ages and everything.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.100
What if we just re-image them this week?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.600
That's when you find out how much
sick leave you have stored up.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.600
And how often am I going
to refresh the systems,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.600
right?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.730
So then we maintain the stuff.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.700
We get them deployed,
we've done the evaluation,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.550
we get them deployed,
and then we have to turn

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.730
around and maintain them.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.600
And the whole idea here is
systems management stuff.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.600
Are we going to centralize this or
are we going to let somebody down

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.430
at the different departments or
schools or different sections of the

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.600
campus have their own management?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.590
Are we going to do training for that?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.600
How are we going to handle licenses?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.500
How are we going to handle the system
software and the updates and stuff,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.600
the day-to-day things, third-party apps?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.600
What about help desk ops?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.680
You know, are you going to do help
desk operations based on,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.020
well, who's in the office today or
do we actually have a help

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.600
desk team to do this stuff?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.600
What about all the workflow management
and client management stuff?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.990
That's beginning to
really pop up because,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.600
you know, there's two distinct thoughts
on client management.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.580
Some people do client management from
what I call the replacement mechanism.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.990
We don't manage the systems,
we just rebuild them on a regular basis,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.500
right?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.590
And in some cases that
could be at every login.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.590
Well, that's one way to do management.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.600
The other way to do it is to
actually control the systems

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.600
and who has access to what.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.600
And that's another
mechanism for doing it.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.600
But which one are you going to use
and how are you going to do it?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.600
And once again, if you're going to do all
this stuff and somebody says,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600
you know, you can only have three
people to help you,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.250
then, you know,
are they going to pay you enough to

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.600
have somebody else paint your house?

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.910
Because you're not home for it.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.960
The life cycle in action,
simple walkthrough, right?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.020
We review the systems, we evaluate them,
we evaluate what our users need,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.180
we determine the hardware
and software we want,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.200
then we start creating our images,
we cycle back and forth in the test mode.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.700
And that's something that's come
out this week where a lot of

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.960
people that have been questioning,
you know, how do I go about doing that?

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.350
If you don't have a test environment,
if you don't have a testing lab,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.070
and I'm not talking about beta
testing with your own users,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.580
okay?

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.090
I'm talking about actually having
a lab environment that you can go

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.280
out and run and test this stuff in.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.620
The most successful sites I've
seen just in education alone

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.970
are schools that have their,
are schools and campuses where they

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.490
have a dedicated testing environment
where they have a sample set of what

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.410
they run every day and they actually
run it through the pattern before it

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.300
makes it out to the general public.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.250
They are very good at maintaining
stability in their environments.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.710
On the other hand,
the guys that go to the warehouse

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.860
the week before school starts,
they're not going to be able to do that.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.350
They're going to be able to run it
through the pattern before school

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.330
starts and unbox 3,000 new computers,
tend to be a little frazzled.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.300
We deploy the systems, manage them,
update them, and so forth,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.600
and then we're back to square one.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.110
Some of the examples we do
for tasks based on the tools

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.900
that Apple provides for this,
obviously asset management,

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.880
remote control, help desk operations we
can use remote desktop for.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.820
We can image systems using
Net Install and the new ASR Multicast.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.850
We can do software distribution
with ARD and Net Install.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.150
Usage management is
Work Group Manager and the Manage

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.200
Client Settings and all the stuff
in the preference manifest and

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.340
everything that's built into that now.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.030
Patching and updating ARD again
and using the Net Install,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.840
Netboot technology.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.240
Pick the solutions that match the needs.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.010
This is one of those things where you
know we have solutions out there that

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:56.600
are the self-proclaimed I do everything
tool or whether or not you want to

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.840
use that or subset that into well I'll
use that for fifty percent of my tasks

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.280
but I've got some best of breed tools
I want to mix and match for that too.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.280
You may want to do that.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.570
The other thing is cost of
ownership versus IT expertise.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.730
I hear especially in education a lot
of times people saying well we don't

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.750
have the budget for but think about
it if you're gonna if you say well

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.140
we don't have the budget for the
commercial tool but I'm gonna spend

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.150
the next 900 hours tweaking some
open source tool to make it work.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.770
That's a budget thing too,
unless they're not paying you,

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.850
in which case there's something
really weird going on here.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.500
The task versus the tool.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.320
If you have to do imaging,
then focus on imaging and

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.960
pick the right tool for it.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.520
If you have to do updates, management,
and so forth, focus on the result.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.490
The real end result of this is,
can the users do what

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.950
they're meant to do?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.560
We're back to that,
is the purpose of the IT staff to

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.760
play with lots of cool technology
and tell the users what they can do?

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.660
Or is it the purpose of the IT staff
to be able to support the end

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.430
users in accomplishing their job?

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.760
It depends on the organization you're in,
I guess.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.710
The 90-10 rule still lives.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.660
You do 90% of the work,
so your users do 10% or less.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.110
And that has been the way
it's been for decades.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.080
And if you can make that work,
then use the right tool for it.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.570
Asset management as a tool,
as a task example, look at what we can do

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.280
with Remote Desktop.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.460
Has anybody here not seen Remote Desktop?

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.160
yet.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.340
I think everybody got a
good shot at it this week.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.220
Okay, there's a lot of cool
stuff you can do with that.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.470
Imaging systems using
Net Install with all the installs,

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.490
all the be able to do core installs,
application update installs and so forth.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.120
It's there.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.100
The tools are built in.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.800
You get the server,
you get the ability to do that.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.580
For usage management,
doing the manage client stuff with

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.740
the preference tools and being
able to add those in and do the

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.910
really nice preference manifest.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.910
How many of you attended the
preference manifest session yesterday?

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.190
Okay, how many of you knew
there was one yesterday?

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.000
Or how many of you didn't
know there was one yesterday?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.850
See?

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.690
We actually did a session
yesterday that showed you how to

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.040
create preference manifests for
applications so that you could

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.700
manage applications remotely on your
network for a thousand users at once.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:19.950
and it was hidden under the title of
writing network friendly applications.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.780
Yeah, well, that's all right.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.180
We'll publish the details.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.500
All you do is go to the developer
website and actually search on the term

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.720
preference manifest and then you mail
that to your favorite developer and say,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.200
I want to manage 2,000 users and
I want to set these specific things

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.330
for these users and to do that,
you guys need to implement a preference

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.480
manifest for your application.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.300
And the best part is for them to do it,
it involves at most maybe seven lines

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.450
of code they got to add to their
application in order to make it work.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.900
It's very cool.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.270
So what we're going to talk about though,
we're going to spend most of our time on

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.200
open source tools for lifecycle tasks.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.670
And so I've got James and Steven are
going to come up here and take you

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.200
guys through what they do using the
tools that are available to them.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.550
A mix of open source,
a little bit of commercial stuff,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.720
a little bit of ARD and
everything else and tell you

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.200
what they do for their stuff.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.130
So the first person I want
to bring up is Steven.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.200
If everybody will say hey.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.200
Come on Steven.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
Yeah, cool.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.400
Wow, the lights are bright up here.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400
We did get feedback.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:36.400
Yeah, okay, cool.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.970
Okay, that's me.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.690
I am Steve Doyle from Edith
Cairn University in Perth,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.190
Western Australia.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.260
Okay, it's better that way.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.100
Okay, so Edith Cairn University in
Perth is a very large university.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.310
The School of Communications and
Multimedia has over two and

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.600
a half thousand students.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.390
I'm having mic issues and
they're going to yell at me.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.290
Okay, we're the largest first year uni-
we run the largest first year

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.710
communications school in Australia and
we run a lot of disparate schools.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.140
So one of the reasons that I put
this slide up is to tell people

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.840
the stuff that I have to put
up with on a day-to-day basis.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.440
We run streams from advertising
through to hat making.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.920
I run professional recording
studios down to HDTV.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.690
I have people call me to say
the textile machine is stuck

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.120
with a sewing machine needle.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.070
At the same time, people are saying the
TV station is crapping out.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.120
Oh, I wasn't going to like to swear.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.720
We run a lot of disparate machines.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.040
We're an entire Mac faculty.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.400
We have over 600 machines.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.190
We're completely Mac in
server and client.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.750
John put this slide up before and
I think it's probably the most

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.620
perfect illustration of what I do.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.610
I've never seen anything
hit it quite as much.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.640
Every single component of that slide is
my day-to-day job from asset management,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.370
which I despise,
through to looking after the

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.460
clients and the machines.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.700
We have some significant
problems with our machines.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.800
The main problems are how
do we image the machines.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.410
We have 16 different labs.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.000
I have 16 different SOEs,
which always makes me smile.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.640
You have a standard
operating environment,

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.100
but you have 16 of them.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.600
Once I've done that,
we give each one of our students

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.100
a gigabyte of network homes.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.600
We have a whole big rack of
XSERVs and XSERV RAIDs to do this.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.750
So I need to keep the machines imaged.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.310
The students are the most
demanding group on the planet,

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.600
apart from maybe academics,
who the students also

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.100
want everything new.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.820
If the new iTunes comes out,
if there's an upgrade to Final Cut,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.010
they want it yesterday.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.510
We have to keep these machines
imaged and up to date.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.940
Once they're imaging up to date,
my concern is monitoring them.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.350
We have an awful lot of
hardware in our facilities,

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.240
but we have a higher management who
tend to judge this by walking up

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.600
and down the corridor and saying,
"Well, no one's using the computers.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.170
I saw them.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.830
The lab was empty." I pointed out that
it was five o'clock on a Friday afternoon

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.700
and people have better things to do,
but clearly not everyone has better

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.910
things to do at five o'clock on a Friday.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.900
And my personal favorite, asset tracking.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.960
I despise asset tracking
with all my heart.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.060
I'm probably the most
untidy person in the world.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.980
My idea of asset tracking is throwing
the paper in a corner somewhere and

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.080
hoping no one ever asks about it.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.780
However, apparently auditing
don't like that so much.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.960
And then once I've got
those machines done and in,

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.120
I want to see who's using them.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.700
Our students are a
wonderful group of people,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.570
and I adore them.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.510
But it seems very strange to me that
they'll only use the same computer

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.260
for the three years of their degree.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.260
The fact that we have updated
that machine and moved

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.660
it and changed it around,
they'll follow the same computer.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.280
Most odd.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.890
I want to see who's using our lab.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.000
Why did we schedule the Final Cut lab
in the three-year-old iMac lab

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.100
instead of putting it in the G5 lab?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.540
Okay, once we've got the
machine problem sorted,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.460
we have a user management problem.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.230
We have a very transient
student population.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.090
We have a large group of
Norwegian students who come in.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.220
And I have no problems getting the
technical support team to run induction

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.100
courses with the Norwegian students.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.100
They're very helpful in that regard.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.630
Our students demand 24/7
access to all our facilities,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.090
365 days a year.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.100
Students who are paying $1,000 a
semester for a unit don't want holidays.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.100
When I was a student,
I didn't really want to go to university.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.100
These kids are paying for it
and they want to be there.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.100
They want high availability
for all their machines.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.580
We have software licensing challenges.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.020
We use Key Server to
address some of this,

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.300
but I need to keep track of
who's using the licenses and how

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.100
many licenses have been used.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.450
Our students are smart.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.550
They go and tell their parents
that they need a PowerBook and

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.060
an iPod to do this degree.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.190
Mum and Dad are so happy that
they've got into university,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.090
they tend to buy them.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.100
We get lots of students who are
bringing their own machines.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.990
And of course, we're higher ed.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.040
We're looking at one-to-one as well.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.100
And we have the reluctant students.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.470
We have students who have bought
PCs who want to integrate them into our

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.100
facilities to access their documents.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.970
And they also want to know why
Final Cut won't run on their Dell.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.040
Still not solved that one yet.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.030
So these three are separate
yet they're connected areas.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.540
It's all IT management related.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.350
It's all something that
comes across my desk.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.680
A lab isn't a lab anymore.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.000
When I started doing this, we had labs.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.410
You'd go into a Final Cut lab or
whatever it was at the time lab.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.370
It's not the case anymore.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.250
We get students who will bring three or
four machines in together and hook them

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.770
up and make their own rendering lab.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:10.920
We don't get continual workstations.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.080
We have people who job share and they
computer share and they have a system

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.400
that I don't know anything about.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.900
So what they'll do is if someone's
working Monday through to Wednesday,

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.100
they'll have that PowerBook.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.580
And then on the way
home on Wednesday night,

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:22.230
they'll drop it at the
other person's house,

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.050
stop off for a beer,
and then that machine will

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.360
be the other person's.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.070
I don't know where all
my machines are going.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.750
And if it's got a microchip in it,
it is ultimately my fault.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.760
This applies to Xboxes and PlayStations.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.800
If people can't get it to
work and it's got a chip,

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.320
we're the IT people.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.740
We can fix everything.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.390
So it comes across my desk at some point.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.240
It's sad, but true.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.920
I think.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.990
I said it happens to you guys as well.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.190
I'm not surprised.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.540
And as I said,
I really am probably the most

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.380
unplanned person in the world.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.960
But I can't do my job properly.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.370
I can't manage these machines I've got
because the ground rules are changing.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.130
I can't control the machines.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.400
I do know where they are.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.400
I can't forecast how many
more machines I need.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.400
And I can't make any planning decisions.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.320
So I got really, really cross one day.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.400
And people don't believe
me when I tell them this.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.390
This was written out
of complete laziness.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.130
I do not enjoy leaving my desk.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.400
It interferes with my iChatting
and my movie downloads.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.880
I want to run everything from my desk.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.140
So we wrote a help desk system.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.310
It's completely open sourced.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.910
I've been copying some heat because
I haven't released the source code.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:27.800
My PowerBook died.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.440
I intend to do it very, very soon.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.950
For my Australian friends
in the audience,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.390
that's very, very soon.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.490
It's all written in PHP and
MySQL with some shell scripting.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.060
I am not the world's greatest programmer.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.810
In fact, I'm probably one of the top five
worst programmers in the world.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.800
However, it kind of works.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.780
And it leverages heavily
on the ARD2 stuff.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.940
So I'm going to talk
through that really quickly.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.800
Why did I write it?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.800
I didn't like any of the
off-the-shelf help desk systems.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.800
Is anyone here a professional
commercial help desk system developer?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.800
I'm going to get so
burnt on this one day.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.790
Every system that I saw was really,
really expensive.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.800
It was designed for a per-client basis.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.860
It was costing too much money to deploy.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.780
It didn't really seem to
get me what I wanted to do.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.800
So I locked myself away for three
months in my office and wrote a new one.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.790
And they didn't meet our needs.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:17.800
That's why they weren't flexible.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.620
They didn't scale.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.790
And as I said,
600 machines that come in and out.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.800
They get loaned out.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.790
We do test one-to-one deployments.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.280
Sometimes an academic will
take them and lend them to a

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.710
school so they can do a trial.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.800
There were no scalability in that.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.880
in the systems I looked at.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.570
Okay, the other reasons.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.730
I seem to see the same set of data
entered in the same place all the time.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.830
We enter the information to a purchasing
system to say we've bought it.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.450
We enter it into the login system
to say that we're allowed to use it.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.510
We enter it into a management system to
say that we know where the machine is.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.660
And then someone would come
in with a computer and say,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.560
hey, do you know where this
computer turned up from?

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.800
I would have staff who I have never
heard of ringing me to support a

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.650
computer that I'd never heard of in a
building I didn't know we supported.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.970
It's quite difficult to do that.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.380
And it's not the staff member's fault.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.530
They didn't understand that we hadn't
been informed of this information.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.660
And I'd see machines go missing and
I'd have new machines magically appear.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.060
Okay, so I'm going to talk
about the feature summary.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.060
I can talk about this
for about six hours.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.730
John wasn't kidding.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.550
So I'm going to speak fast
and just hit the high points.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.720
Okay, so it's all MySQL.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.580
It's got PHP.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.580
There is zero documentation so far.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:23.810
And people laugh.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.940
I'm not kidding.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.370
There isn't any documentation at all
apart from swear words in the comments

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.980
when I couldn't get bits to work.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.930
Before I release it,
I will remove the swear words.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.940
Okay, I was lying.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.370
I'm going to put the swear words in.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.580
It's completely modular based.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.860
The idea of this was
written for me in higher ed,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.110
but I work a lot with K to 12,
and I work a lot with my

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.090
enterprise colleagues.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.310
It's completely module based.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.280
If you need a module to do it,
you can just add the module into it,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.230
and it's applicable to
all the other areas.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.630
So we've already seen some
of the universities and some

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.080
of the Mac enterprise group
offer to write modules for it.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.150
So completely module based and scalable.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.520
And it was designed for my helper
monkeys and I'm taking credit on

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.710
record for the term helper monkey.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.200
We run a tier one support level where
we have students who do assistant tasks.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.880
The problem we were having was that
more and more of the jobs were being

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.550
escalated up to tier two and tier
three because the tier one group didn't

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.600
have the skill set to re-image a lab.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.530
What I wanted to do was be
able to delegate some of these

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.310
tasks to them and do it from a
central administrative console.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.450
and we just call them helper
monkeys to annoy them.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.510
I'm just going to talk about
the ARD stuff today though.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.600
Okay.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.810
So I didn't realize we were going
to see such extensive ARD stuff

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.000
at the conference so I won't go
into this as much as I thought.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.600
But ARD is a killer product.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.960
It's got some seriously
powerful hardware searching.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.650
You can do some really nice
lab organization and imaging

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:50.710
options with this stuff.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.140
I can integrate into it
with Workgroup Manager.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.440
I can check for machine and network
status for the help desk system.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.100
I can control how I image each one of
my labs through the help desk system

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.100
and I deal with package making as well,
which has always been the

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.150
voodoo art that I've never been
able to get working properly.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.270
Okay, so ARD2 runs on a client server
model as most of you know.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.200
It comes with a data
collection model as well.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.660
It currently stores data
in a centralized server.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.740
It would be nice if we could
leverage that in a future

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.100
version to store it in one spot.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.790
And it runs in Postgres.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.060
which of course I knew nothing about.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.100
So when you look at the ARD information
that's stored in the Postgres table,

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.230
this is just a screen
grab of some PHP stuff,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.250
it's sorted into two separate tables,
a property name map table and

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.110
a systems information table.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.140
When you break it down a little bit more,
you can see it stores the object name,

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.190
the property name,
and the property map ID.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.470
In the systems information
table it stores a little

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.590
bit more information though.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.500
We get the computer ID, the object name,
the property name, an item sequencer,

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.480
the value,
and the time it was last updated.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.430
So if we drill down some more,
you can see I get some really

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.000
useful data about the information.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.580
So I can look at each machine
and see if there's a wireless

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.350
card installed or if Apple Talk,
remember Apple Talk, is active.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.990
I can look to see what
the boot ROM version is.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.230
I can look at the processor speed.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.720
I can look at the machine serial number.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.280
Some really granular data there.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.750
And because the stores are last updated,
I can run scans on this information

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.200
and do a state check to see if
this information has changed.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.310
So if someone unplugs a network card
or someone plugs in a wireless card,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.340
if I compare the two
scans that I perform,

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.600
I have a change state.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.960
And that's what we leverage off.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.180
So we leverage completely off
the information that ARD stores.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.610
So you do need to set the system to
scan your machines on a specified basis.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:39.790
I do it every two hours.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.620
We're working with Apple to try and
make this a little bit more automated,

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.290
but you can set how often you want to
check the information on the machine.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.140
I don't touch anyone else's data,
so I take this information and put

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.400
it into a centralized MySQL database.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.640
I'm also better at writing
MySQL stuff than I am Postgres.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.220
The goal for it was to
be a one-stop console.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.230
So it's all web-based.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.250
You can run it from BlackBerrys.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.520
You can run it from wireless palms.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.840
You can run it from everything.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.900
So you can control it all
from a web-based console.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.000
And the tagline was
powerful for the powerful,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.170
simple enough for the
delegation or helper monkeys.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:16.110
So basically the workflow that we
follow is our faculty is called CCI.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.800
So we scan through the help desk and
look for the machines on the CCI subnet.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.700
So any machine that's got an ARD active,
the system scan will find it and store

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.800
the information into the Postgres table.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.640
What I then do is suck that
information out from the Postgres

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.390
table in ARD and put it into
my own MySQL help desk database.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:37.840
Yes, I already said that.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.320
So when you look at the Postgres
information that's stored,

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.310
it stores 79 separate pieces
of information currently about

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.300
each one of the machines.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.910
I tend to look for these seven,
but in the help desk system you can

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.220
turn on and off which one of those 79
pieces of information you want tracked.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.670
So I look for the web sharing
status of the machine,

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.300
the free RAM slots in the machine,
and I was telling a funny anecdote

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.560
the other day of I found students
putting RAM into the machines because

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.300
they wanted them to render faster.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.170
This system will actually check and
look at the status of the RAM in case

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.300
normally people are stealing the RAM.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.370
It looks for drive free space,
so you can specify a warning flag if the

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.300
drive volume falls under 5% or 10% free.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.630
You can look at the wireless
status of the machine.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.300
You can look at the SSS status.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.300
This is too hard.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.300
System versions and Samba sharing status.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.300
We use it to allocate machines into labs.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.240
One of the best things that
I ever did was paint the color

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.380
of each one of our labs One wall
in the lab a different color,

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.280
so I have a green lab, a blue lab,
a pink lab.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.120
It's an absolute wonderful tool
for help desk because the students

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.300
are trained to look at the wall
and tell us what room they're in.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.950
Honestly, I'm not kidding, genius.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.800
Sure you still get the students
who go the walls are white and you

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.420
say which wall and they go back and
they check and go no still white.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.740
They're not quite smart enough to look
at all four walls but they're okay.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.110
Honestly, try it.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.540
It works.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.520
So what we allow to do
is to allow the machine,

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.500
to allow how to allocate
machines to a lab.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.760
So from the help desk system we can
say any machine in Green Lab will

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.090
be net booted from this image,
from this server with this image,

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.200
and away it goes.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.070
The new version of the system is also
running with 10.4 multicasting as well.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.760
So you can say I want these three
servers to push all the network imaging.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.260
So what I can do is I can
delegate to a helper monkey.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.440
I can say, okay,
we're teaching a final class

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.060
in the Green Lab at 2 o'clock.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.260
Reimage the lab.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.980
Previously that was a task as John would
say I'd have to send a swarm of monkeys

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.500
with firewire drives to reimage them
or we'd have to do it ourselves and set

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.860
up the net restore service to do it.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.020
What I can do now is send a
delegated admin to a web page to say,

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.650
and it goes from a pull down menu,
say pick Green Lab, pick the image,

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.660
make it restore fast, click a button,
the machines will reboot.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.450
We use some custom SR hacks to
get it going and away we go.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.510
So we've delegated some
tasks down really nicely.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:57.320
My personal pet hatred was entering
computer lists into Workgroup Manager.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.410
It's a funny beast.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.170
It forgets what it knows or
sometimes denies knowledge.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.070
What the help desk system allows
you to do is scan the machines in

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.620
with ARD and it clicks a button
called suck which works nicely

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.960
for the auditing process as well.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.190
I just picked it at random.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.270
It clicks a button called Sark
and sucks all the computer list

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.860
information out into the two text
files that Workgroup Manager uses.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.780
You export them to your desktop and
import them into Workgroup Manager and

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.310
you've automatically got computer
list management based on the stuff

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.860
that was set up in the help desk.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.670
So for us to set up our labs,
we say Green Lab, allocate to Green Lab,

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.170
click Sark, information,
and then Workgroup Manager allows

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.610
us to do our computer list
MCXing from the Green Lab.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.940
Okay, so yeah,
we do a lot of machine tracking.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.310
As an IT manager, I like to be proactive.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.840
So what we do is do a lot of
the information and try to

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.200
do it on a proactive basis.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.390
So we specify how often
ARD scans our network.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.670
For this case, we do it every 60 minutes.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.300
And it searches the Postgres database
and it searches the MySQL database,

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.400
looks for change dates.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.610
I track back to 10
different change dates,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.610
so I can go back and say, well, hang on,
the last 10 times we scanned the network,

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.410
this machine had no one using
it or it had all its RAM in.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.420
But now something has changed
and we can look at that.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.770
It looks for missing
machines and extra machines.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.220
So if a student brings a
machine in on the network and

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.380
they've got ARD turned on,
we can know, we can find it,

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.310
we can track where they were and
what they were doing with it.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.970
But the cool thing that it does
is the machine monitoring stuff.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.820
I like to be able to get out to the
machines or send a helper monkey to

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.830
the machines when I know something's
wrong rather than waiting for

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.100
someone to report something in to me.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.690
So what it does is it watches for
the change states and then alerts

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.970
the helper monkeys or the help
desk system of the change state.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.340
One of the things that we'd see
a lot of was students would come

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.670
in and disconnect the projectors
from the projector machines,

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.840
hook them up to their own laptop,
play Halo for six hours from 12 to 6 a.m.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.180
Go home and say they need an
extension for their assignment.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.160
The lecturer would come in,
I wouldn't know how to

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:57.240
plug the projector back in.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.500
They would scream that
nothing ever worked.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.690
My boss would scream at me.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.030
I'd scream at the help of monkeys.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.990
It was just sad and I thought we
could do that in a better way.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.500
So we looked at how the students
were altering the machine settings.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.320
If students are going in and
turning web sharing on or

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.540
SSH sharing on or Samba sharing on,
they're probably doing something

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.300
they shouldn't be doing.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.450
We're looking for theft and damage.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.780
And my personal favorite of hatred,
I would go into labs and students would

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:26.170
have taken the left mouse cable from one,
move it across, stretch the cable,

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.400
pull the padlock,
put it into the other side,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.300
and then try and use
the machine left-handed.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.700
And I would say,
"Why don't you use the mouse on

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.960
the computer?" And they'd say,
"It doesn't work." And I'd say,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.730
"Did you tell anybody?" And they'd say,
"No,

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.650
we thought you knew." Because we're IT,
we know everything.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.350
We don't know everything.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.140
So what the system does is proactively
tells me when it sees any change

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.000
states in any of this information.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
It sends an iCal to
the nominated on-task,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
on-job help desk person.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.100
So when the help desk person wakes
up in the morning and goes to work,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.360
in their little iCal is all
the computers that have found

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.000
something wrong with them.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
So Green 12 schedules a job
for them to fix the mouse.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
It has an integrated knowledge base,
so it sends a hyperlink with this.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.040
So it says, you know,
the last four people who

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.000
fixed this problem fixed it
by plugging the mouse back in.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.260
Oddly enough,
it didn't fix it for one time.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.070
I've never quite worked
out what that problem was.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.440
So it sends an iCal event.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.210
That's great for me because I can see
an overview of the helper monkeys.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.850
It's great for my boss because he
can see an overview of the helper

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.790
monkeys and ask me what I'm doing.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.860
Because this is a,
and I didn't talk about this,

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.980
this is a completely fully
functional help desk system.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.270
We're talking about job tickets,
asset tracking, the whole thing.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.700
It's got an F12 dashboard widget
so students on the machines,

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.000
when we roll to Tiger on the desktop,
when the students hit F12 they'll be able

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.580
to log their own jobs into the system.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.800
It automatically logs that into
the help desk system so I can get a

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.660
feel for the trend of the machine.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.540
If the machine's mouse keeps breaking and
the staff keep plugging it back in again,

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.140
it might not just be the mouse.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.000
We might have some USB problems so
I can get a state of the machine.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.620
It sends an email to me and our help
desk team so everyone knows all the

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.360
different jobs that they're across.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.570
It can do a combination.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:07.740
The management team adore it.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.750
We can keep track of
what our staff are doing.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.900
We're so quickly to the desktop,
it's amazing.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.290
So the students don't know things
are broken most of the time

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.600
before we've even fixed them.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.820
And I had it sending SMSs,
but I got begged to have that turned off.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.710
So when the mouse got unconnected in G14,
the helper monkey would get a page.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.600
But at 3 in the morning they didn't
seem to care so much about that.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.600
So if you want to do that,
you can actually turn that on as well.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.560
So the sample alerts that I look at,
as I have 3 minutes to go.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.770
I look at drive free space.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:40.600
So I specify I want to know every
machine on my network that I'm managing

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.600
that has less than 10% drive free.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.600
Remember I can track back and I can
see where the drive space has gone.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.520
So I can look at states, okay,
it's all been stored in the

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.520
correct folder or hang on,
somebody has snuck something in

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.600
that they shouldn't have done.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.600
I can change an SSH status.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600
I look at the system version.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.850
That's great for managing academics
machines when they start to install

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.600
new versions of the operating system
and claim they didn't do that.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.590
We can say, well, hang on.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.600
So that's what you did.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.560
We look at the free RAM slots
in case people are nicking RAM.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.600
Web sharing, window sharing,
wireless status and mouse.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.600
But this can work for any of
the 79 features that ARD tracks.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.220
So if you find people are
randomly turning Apple Talk on,

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.600
you can go and ask them why.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.080
The black voodoo art of package making
is handled by the help desk system.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.070
One of the tasks that is always
bumped up the scale to tier 2

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.120
or tier 3 is making packages.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.410
What we've done is written a whole
pile of code that leverages the

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.450
package maker command line tool.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.730
So it runs a series of scripts and
makes its own packages that the

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.920
helper monkeys can push out with ARD.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.040
And that's a pretty cool demo,
which I don't have time for.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.890
So, for example,
I can get the helper monkeys

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.220
to change a desktop pattern.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.410
I can get them to set the
volume on different machines

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.180
or a whole lab of machines,
which is great when you need to

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.520
reboot a lab which is next to a
lab which is doing a hearing test.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.320
And it builds a library of scripts.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.770
So if you need to go back and say, oh,
I remember that script that

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.150
we used to repurpose our OD,
remake the package for

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.620
me and send it back out.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.540
And it basically allows us to
have a full automation process.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.020
The machine gets delivered to us.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.490
We scan the barcode in.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:14.890
The data is automatically entered into
the help desk system based on the barcode

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.860
so we can track the serial number,
the rest of the information.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.090
We select the allocation of the lab,
so we say this machine is

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.720
going to be a staff machine,
it's going to Green 14,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.500
it's going to be a
Final Cut machine in the purple lab.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.740
The machine net boots,
queries the help desk, says hello,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.260
I'm new here, what should I do?

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.660
The help desk system says,
well you're in Green 13 my friend,

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.430
I'd like you to boot from this server,
this is the software

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.040
image that you're having,
and away it goes.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.280
It logs how long it took to image,
when it re-imaged its last time.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.140
And we run a whole pile of
user interactions which I don't

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.400
have time to talk about.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.470
So it stores user data,
how many pages they printed,

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.120
what applications they launched,
what they did,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.440
and we're looking at expanding that.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.220
So we get some really serious granular
data of what students are doing.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.130
And this is all in a SQL database.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.310
You can write, and we will be writing,
a whole pile of XML code to suck

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.210
it out and give you live reports
of what your machines are doing.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:06.840
And remember,
you haven't left your desk yet.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.560
The stuff I didn't talk about,
it's an entire asset management system.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.320
It deals loans, it deals bookings,
it does the whole IT management

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.200
stuff that I didn't like.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.330
And it's an extremely customisable
and fully fledged help desk system.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.200
Everything that I didn't like about the
other help desk systems we've written.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.950
So I only talked about the AOD stuff
because that's the coolest,

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.400
but it is a help desk system.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.680
It allows you to manage all of this stuff
and all your machines from your chair.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.180
Okay, James is going to come up next,
but if you scroll down my contact

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.600
details or John will have it
afterwards in the slides I put up.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.360
I'm quite happy to talk to people about
this stuff and we're going to hang

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.600
around for a little bit afterwards.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.700
So now I'll hand over to my friend
and colleague James Reynolds.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.350
I'm James Reynolds.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.220
I'm going to talk a little
bit about RadMine and uLab.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.970
And first about RadMine.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.940
I'm not really going to say
anything new to anyone who

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.500
already knows how to use RadMine.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.900
Hopefully there's people in
the audience who-- actually,

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.920
let's ask,
how many people use RadMine right now?

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:17.730
How many have not used
RadMine but have looked at it?

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.980
Okay, how many have not used it
because it looks too hard?

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.800
Okay, all right.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.420
So I'm gonna talk a
little bit about RadMine.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.820
Hopefully I can get people to use it.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.430
It's wonderful, it's great.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.680
We love it.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:38.100
If anyone has managed Mac OS 9 and used,
what was it called, RevRDist,

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.140
this is very similar to RevRDist,
only in my opinion,

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.870
it's a lot more powerful.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.000
And I would almost say
easier to use than RevRDist.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.040
I think the learning curve on RevRDist
was probably harder than RadMine.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.940
So RadMine,
let me come over here so I can see.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.940
It's command line tools basically.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.070
There's no GUI, there's no anything else.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.560
It's just a bunch of command line tools.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.960
They manage files on the hard disk.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.400
It's the main component of RadMine.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.600
There are lots of other things that help
you with RadMine that are GUI tools,

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.740
but the main component of RadMine
is a couple of command line tools.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.140
So the features, of course, it's free.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.980
We really like that.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:23.280
There's no per machine licensing,
so we can scale it as large as we want.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.780
It is very popular.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.280
There are a lot of people who use it,
and it is open source.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.230
And there are several people
who are modifying the code

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.860
for their particular needs.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:39.460
It runs on many Unix platforms,
so if you don't have an X server,

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:43.470
any other sort of Macintosh server,
you can run it on Linux or several

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.130
BSD variants if that's what you have.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:50.380
SSL is supported,
so you can have encryption on

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.040
all your network transfers.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.180
And it's very easy.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.220
You can get very detailed configurations.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.280
Not easy,
but it's very-- it is easy to specify

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.070
exactly what machine gets what.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.150
So where Steven was talking about,
he has 16 standard images.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.990
That actually is fairly
easy to do with RadMine.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I'll talk about that.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.040
Also,
it's very detailed hard disk management.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.370
So every single file on the hard
disk is cataloged and stored on the

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.660
centralized server so that you have
access-- you basically know exactly

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.080
what's on your computer's hard drives.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.280
And you can-- I mean,
that's often how I debug problems.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.910
Someone says there's a
problem with this machine.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:33.100
I go to the server half the time before
I actually go to the client machine to

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.200
see if there's actually a difference.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.590
'Cause most of the time,
I can see exactly what's on the

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.360
machine just by looking at the server.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:45.280
So the command line tools,
the main one that resides on the server,

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.380
that runs on the server, is RadMine.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.940
It's what talks to the client tools.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.220
And so the RadMine's
process is always running.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.180
It opens a port,
and it listens for the client tools.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.930
The client tools, fsstiff,
it doesn't talk over the network.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.480
Basically,
all it does is it scans the hard disk.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.620
It's kind of like a camera.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.900
It just takes a snapshot
of the hard disk.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.350
And it's configurable.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.600
You can tell it, you know,
what exactly to look at.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.550
You can tell it to look at the
whole hard disk or specific

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.140
folders or just one file.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.770
LApply undoes changed files.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.580
LApply does talk over the network.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.670
It talks to the RadMine server.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.910
LCreate uploads changed
files to the server.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.850
Again, it talks over the network again.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.550
I'll talk more about what
LApply and LCreate do.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:39.450
KT Check, it talks to the server,
and it downloads descriptions from the

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:44.140
server basically a description that
says what should be on the machine.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.140
Their descriptions are
called transcripts,

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.340
which is part of an overload.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:55.720
So fsstiff,
how does it know what is changed?

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.710
Basically, fsstiff,
the first thing you do is you're

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.930
going to scan the whole hard disk.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:06.490
And that scan becomes what's
called your base load.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.800
When you scan your hard disk,
you basically have no idea

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.790
what's on the hard disk.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.600
It just scans the whole file
system from beginning to end,

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.000
and then it's cataloged.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.290
Everything's there.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:21.280
So now it knows what was there
at that time it was scanned.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.380
Then what you do when you
want to make an image of that,

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.720
you basically just upload that
all to the server all at once.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.090
And so you've basically got a copy
of that file system on the server.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.720
All scans after that first
scan are differences.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:40.030
And they are -- let's see --
they're uploaded -- they're

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.990
uploaded with Lcreate,
and they are called overloads.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.000
So you have your base load,
and then you have

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.990
overloads on top of that.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:49.800
So like with Steven,
where he has the 16 standard images,

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.490
what we do, we have one standard image,
and then we have all kinds of

00:39:54.490 --> 00:40:00.660
overloads for each different
configuration that we want to have.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.520
So when I scan with fsstiff,
there's two ways I can scan.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.730
I can scan -- so I've got my base load.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.130
I scan the whole hard disk.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.830
And then I can get differences
from that first scan.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.620
Those differences can either
be uploaded with Lcreate or

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.110
they can be undone with Lapply.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:22.120
And so the new files are deleted,
and the missing and modified files,

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.770
they're redownloaded from the server.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.980
So some examples.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.160
The simple example,
create your first scan, your base load.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.420
You change something with
the finders or any other app.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.600
You just change stuff, you know,
create a bunch of new folders.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.010
That's the easiest example.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.900
Then you scan the whole hard disk again.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.390
And then you're going to get
a list of what's changed.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.800
Those basically -- every single
file that you've modified,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.380
you can then remove
those files with Lapply.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:52.940
You run Lapply specifying, you know,
here's the changes that I found.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.490
And Lapply will go and it'll just
start deleting all the files or

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:00.410
redownloading files as it sees it needs.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:04.590
So if you deleted a file,
it will redownload it from the server.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.920
Okay, a more detailed example.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.680
So bringing a machine to a known state.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.180
So I can take any one of your guys'
laptops and I don't have to know what

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.810
was on your laptop before I get it.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.780
It doesn't even matter.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.960
I can download my descriptions of my
machines from my server on your machine.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.990
With those descriptions,
I can then scan your whole hard disk,

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.540
find what's different on your hard
disk with what I have on my hard disks,

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.930
and I can find every single
file that's different.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:46.440
So then what I can do is basically
I can undo all those differences so that

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.440
I can basically borgify any one of your
laptops into one of my lab machines.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:52.740
So that's a great way to do it.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.180
So I can download my descriptions of my
machines from my server on your machine.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.740
So I can download my descriptions
of my machines from my

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.450
server on your hard disk,
find what was on your hard disk,

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.450
find what was different
on your hard disk,

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.590
and I can then scan your whole hard disk.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:50:50.500
[Transcript missing]

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.440
This always throws me off.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:54.620
When at the login panel.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.700
Okay.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.010
Yeah, so that's what I just described.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.490
When logged in,
what I really meant was when

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.130
you're logged in the machine,
we have an icon that we double

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.700
click and then we'll log the machine
out and begin running RadMine.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.250
So both at login and logout,
we can run RadMine and basically

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:14.410
we can leave the machine and
not worry that someone will

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:15.750
come and interrupt the process.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.770
Also, we can do this remotely so that we
can be anywhere we want and we can

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.500
start running RadMine on our machines.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.680
And then also we run it at a
specified time with Cron so that

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.230
all of our machines everywhere,
they just update themselves periodically,

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.150
automatically.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.980
And then we like to ensure that
RadMine finishes by running

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.070
it at startup and this stops.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.160
I remember in the old OS9 days,
students would come and just

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.960
force restart the machines
because it was running maintenance

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.350
and they wanted to use it,
so they forced restart it and it would

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:45.400
boot up and they could then use it.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:50.280
So we run RadMine at startup and
that's pretty much solved that.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.580
I don't think I see our students
doing this anymore ever.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:53:58.400
[Transcript missing]

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:02.920
So in OS 9 days,
users would come to the machine and

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.410
they would mess stuff up constantly.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.610
The next user would come in and, oh,
the machine doesn't work,

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.620
and they would blame us.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.410
But by managing the home
folders at every login,

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:14.260
we are pretty much
guaranteed it always works.

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:18.910
It's also secure and private,
so what the last user did isn't going

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.440
to be available to the next user.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.760
We do cache the home folders,
so basically we move them

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.380
to a private location,
and when that user comes back,

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.780
they can add them to the next user.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.440
We can access their old files,
and this is especially important

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.740
if the machine restarts.

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.900
That way their files aren't deleted
and they can never get them again.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.990
I have had a student cry
because she lost her term paper,

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.240
so that was very
important for us to have.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.830
The security audits,
we scan our computers for

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:51.080
world-writable files and folders
and they are reported to us.

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:56.450
This is part of the reason why we
have the something blank apps webpage.

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:57.980
I don't know if anyone
is familiar with that.

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:04.630
Yeah, so we know a lot about this
because we watch for it.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.180
I remember when we first started watching
for the writable files and folders,

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.970
I mean, we thought we were doing good
and we just found our hard

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.470
disk was just full of them.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.410
If you aren't watching,
you're going to have all

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.140
kinds of them basically.

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:23.130
We had to go through great steps to
stop our apps from doing this and so

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:27.730
there's just too many out there that
not only installs world-writable but

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:28.020
make sure that they're not going to
be used for writing files and folders.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.610
So many of them require
world-writable files and folders

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.440
in order to actually run.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.820
We also check open from our
password because that is the only

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:40.250
stop gate you have from users
having root access if you want to

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.250
stop them from having root access,
which is highly recommended.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.170
And again, same scenario.

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:50.680
When we first started doing this,
we thought we were good and we were

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:54.370
just horrified how many machines
had open from our password off.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.900
Then we also contact a web
server for theft prevention.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.590
We manage printer settings so that
one user can't modify the printer

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.630
settings for the next user so the
settings are restored to every login.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:09.450
And then we also restore resolution
settings so that if a user

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:13.860
changes the resolution setting,
it's restored for the next user.

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.820
We also run in a kiosk
or other automated drone.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:21.180
So we load a web browser
instead of the finder.

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.750
We get rid of the dock,
prevent the finder from

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:26.650
running for the user,
but if the admin user logs in,

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:27.690
they get that.

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:28.020
We load a web browser
instead of the finder.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.320
We also make sure the web
browser window is always open.

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.990
And we clean up the history and cache
folder when the screensaver activates,

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.320
and this is for privacy.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:39.110
And here's a picture of our
lab machines just running

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.800
screensaver over the login panel.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.350
Not very fantastic, actually,
but this is a little

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.640
bit more interesting.

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.580
Our internet kiosk,
all that's running basically is Safari.

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.880
There's no dock, no finder,
and we've changed the permissions on the

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.790
finder so that there's no workarounds
to actually getting around that.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.860
This is our library search catalog.

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.590
And then these are the same
sort of setup except they

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:02.220
point to a different web page.

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:05.820
This is for our reserve desk so that
users can come search a web database to

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:09.690
find materials in the reserve collection.

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:14.010
And then this is one,
we have a display that basically

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:19.440
loops through presentation stuff for
students to see when they come in.

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.830
And this is similar to the kiosk,
but it's a little bit different.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.040
And it runs automated.

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.550
It's actually really nice.

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:33.590
We have -- we have AFP turned on on it,
and the way it's managed that one of the

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:39.410
supervisors who's not very -- you know,
they don't do AFP very much,

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.080
but they basically just
mount the AFP volume.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:44.690
They copy the new presentation
file to the machine,

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:48.220
and it -- the machines detect that
there's a new presentation file there,

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:52.230
and they just swap files basically.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.380
ULabMint is a super,
super hack and totally

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.440
unsupported by Apple.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.730
So when I showed this to John,
he just kind of, he was just kind of,

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.010
he gave me a little bit of flack.

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:09.690
Also, Tiger is not supported yet,
but will be in a few weeks.

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:12.200
For more information,
you can go to our website.

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:15.080
And the documentation
is still in progress.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.910
There is some, but it's,
some of it's a little out of date.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.700
And there are many expected changes that
are going to happen for Tiger support.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.830
So get on the mail list if
you're interested in that.
