WEBVTT

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.130
Oh, good afternoon.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm John DeTroye,
senior consulting engineer with

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.100
Apple's education division.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.210
I'm the client management specialist.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
And this afternoon we're going
to be talking about client

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.730
management in the enterprise.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.700
How many of you were
here last year for the...

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.520
Fun and games we had.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.260
That big huge crowd of kittens up on
stage talking about all their stuff.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.540
We had a lot of fun last year.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.060
This year what we're going to do is we're
going to narrow the focus a little bit.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.600
We're going to talk about
systems lifecycle stuff,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.650
the tasks that are involved in that.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.180
We're going to talk a little bit about
how the enterprise tools fit into that.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.510
I have-- we've picked some of the best
of breed tools to talk about this year

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.760
and how they fit into the lifecycle.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.120
And we've got some customers here,
which is what we really

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.590
want to hear from,
is how do these people

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.620
use this stuff day to day?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.480
How do they live with this?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.060
So let's take a look at what
we have to do in the lifecycle.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.680
What is a systems lifecycle?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.980
How many of you in here
do IT on a regular basis?

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.080
How many of you know how to spell IT?

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.700
What we're going to talk
about is the tasks that you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.260
have to do every single day.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.220
I mean, think about this.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.500
This is the cyclical stuff
that we live with all the time.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.750
The things that we have to
deal with of evaluating,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.730
deploying, and managing all of our tools.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.560
Now,
what are the tasks built within that?

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.120
Here's the whole list.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.830
Asset management, imaging,
software distribution, remote control,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.150
usage management, license management,
patching and upgrading,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.070
and help desk management.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.550
That is our life.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.000
Well, as we go through these,
when we evaluate what we're going to do,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.620
we have to start off the beginning of
the year or the beginning of our cycle,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.690
and we have to figure out
what tasks we're going to do,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.330
how many of those are
going to be in-house,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.230
how many of those are
going to be outsourced.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.070
We have to figure out what
software and hardware we're

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.630
going to be using as we do this,
how much manpower,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.450
how are we going to get through
all these different tasks,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.450
how often.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.660
We also have to deploy all of
these tools using these tasks.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.450
How many system images
am I going to build?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.860
How often am I going
to be deploying these?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.000
Am I going to do manual deployment?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.160
Am I going to be out running around
the entire state with FireWire drives,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.700
re-imaging all the computers in my area?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.560
Am I going to do
network-based deployment,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.290
and what do I need to make that happen?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.270
How often am I going to go
through refreshes on my systems,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.020
or am I going to do it as
needed on an iterative basis?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.230
Management,
the thing we do every single day.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.570
The idea there is, am I going to be doing
centralized system management,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.310
or am I going to have
people down at each site,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.240
department, school,
whatever I'm working with doing this?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.510
License management, simple things.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.740
Password changes.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.530
We always talk, well,
we're going to centralize management,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.560
but then on the average day,
how many people lose

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.100
track of their password,
and we have to react to that?

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.320
And in certain environments,
you may only have minutes to be

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.140
able to get that password reset.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.570
How do we work with that?

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.760
System software and security updates,
hardware issues, third-party app issues,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.610
who's handling the help desk?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.200
You know, is that the, oh,
today it's your turn,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.430
or do we actually have people, you know,
designated as help desk operations?

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.660
And the whole workflow management,
asset management, and so forth,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.190
and the more important stuff at the end.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.640
So we go through this.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.400
This is a regular day-to-day
operation throughout the year.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.350
And if you think about it,
every one of us has to do that.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.460
We sit down and review
our current systems.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.120
We evaluate what our
needs of our users are.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.180
We have to determine the hardware
and software that's required.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.220
And from that,
we build our image sets that

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.040
we're going to use for deployment.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.120
We cycle back and forth,
different test configurations.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.310
Then we go ahead and we
image and deploy the systems.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.220
We manage them.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.160
We do upgrades during the year.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.860
And all of a sudden, bang,
we're back again at the evaluation stage,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.730
figuring out what we did right,
what we did wrong,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.600
and where we need to go with it.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.360
Some good examples,
and this is a little pat

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.400
on our back for Apple,
is how we fit into the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.940
task management set.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.060
Just to give you a common base of
definition for the different tasks

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.940
and where the Apple tools fit in.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.020
For asset management, remote control,
and help desk operations,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.940
we use Apple Remote Desktop.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.760
For imaging systems,
we have NetInstall as part

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.240
of the NetBoot technology,
and we have the new ASR multicast

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.310
that's part of Tiger.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.520
Yes, very cool.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.090
I thought I could just do an hour
on that alone and we'd have fun,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.480
but, you know, no.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.970
All right.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.810
Software distribution using
ARD and NetInstall again.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.740
The usage management stuff,
the Manage Client for X,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.930
all the MCX settings
that are built into that,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.660
patching and upgrading,
using ARD again and Net Install.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.090
One of those things where
all those tasks fit.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.340
As an example, asset management from an
Apple Remote Desktop point of view,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.450
being able to do the
system-level reports,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.220
network reports, memory reports.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.260
One of my favorite ones there
is somebody calls you at

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.790
7.15 in the morning and says,
how much RAM is in every

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.770
Mac in the building?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.320
And you go, you know,
and being able to get that

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.280
kind of information quickly.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.340
For imaging,
using the Net Install to be able

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.930
to do basic Core OS installs,
to be able to do the customized

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.590
installs after the fact,
to be able to do upgrade and

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.090
patch installs and so forth.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.020
For usage management,
using Workgroup Manager and

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.240
the Manage Client for OS X.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.890
Being able to do system-level management,
being able to do system

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.740
preference management,
third-party preference management

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.320
as part of the Tiger Preference
Editor that we have now.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.520
And along with the mobile account
and portable home directory support,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.790
which I will talk about in
more detail tomorrow at,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.930
I think, 10.30 in the morning.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.800
So let's talk about enterprise solutions.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.310
Key contributors to this
from the commercial side,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.720
people that do this stuff every day,
and like I said,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.790
we're going to talk about
some best-of-breed solutions.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.300
What we've got is people from
Sassafras here in the audience,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.800
and I'll talk about K2,
their license management suite,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.800
FileWave and Asset Trustee,
LandDesk with their management suite,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.730
and Alteris with their management suite.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.180
four key contributors to
the enterprise IT side.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.430
As an example,
we walk back through these tasks again.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.590
Look at asset management.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.220
What does Sassafras do with this with K2?

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.580
We can do complete inventories of
all your Mac and Windows software.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.600
It doesn't matter whether
you're managing it or not,

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.500
just literally an inventory of all the
software that's installed on the systems.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.830
To be able to do hardware audits
and look for additional details

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.160
about the OS and the computer
profiles and additional items that

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.900
you want to plug into your database.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.770
Being able to do
incremental updates of that.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.500
So what are the differentials that have
happened over the last month or last

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.470
week or last six months or whatever?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.340
K2 version 6.1 is coming down the road.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.660
It's going to include
web-based reporting.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.760
It's going to include a
Tiger widget for the managers

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.040
to be able to look at reports.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.000
And it's also going to enable RSS feeds
for the web-based stuff so that you

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.790
can see any changes that have happened.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.080
Plus the fact that it uses its
own template internal report

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.580
mechanism plus ODBC compliance.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.220
It's going to be able to use compliant
report mechanisms for external reports.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.980
And the back end of this runs on both
Mac OS X or Windows-based servers.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.370
FileWave with Asset Trustee uses an agent
that provides for automated gathering

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.650
and storage of all the hardware and
software information into its database.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.310
And the client software actually
initiates the scans on the

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.560
computers to provide the information
back to the server database,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.000
and then it is Mac OS X server-based.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.400
Landesk does a client-side scanner
that is completely configurable so you

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.870
determine what items you want to gather.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.890
And you can perform full hardware
and software inventories.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.690
It'll also do incremental and
delta scans of what the changes

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.430
are over a period of time.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.200
And we can also add in additional
database items to scan for other

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.500
non-computer related items.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.850
Plus the ability to do completely
customized inventory reporting.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.650
This system is Windows Server based
on the back end.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:09:24.600
[Transcript missing]

00:09:25.300 --> 00:11:48.300
[Transcript missing]

00:11:49.300 --> 00:14:38.500
[Transcript missing]

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.000
For license management,
K2 does complete control at

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.770
whatever level you specify
for the software license.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.660
So you can have unlimited site licenses,
and you can apply that to an application,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.480
and then everybody that's allowed
to use it will be allowed to use it.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.100
I can go in and node lock a license
where this specific computer can

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.320
launch this specific application,
and that's the only one

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.920
that's allowed to use it.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.910
I can also set concurrent licenses
where if I have 50 licenses to

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.760
a computer and I install that
software on 200 different systems,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.380
only 50 computers will be allowed
to launch that software at a time,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.040
even though it's installed
on all the computers.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.520
And plus, you can specify very,
very distinct custom limits

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.180
and restrictions to this.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.180
And also define multiple profiles
for different sets of computers,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.870
depending upon how you
want them to be used.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.570
Being able to reclaim abandoned
licenses would be if you have a

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.960
computer that moves to a different
department and the software isn't

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.090
needed on that computer anymore,
you can see that the license

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.940
isn't in use on there,
and you can actually regain that license

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.520
and apply it to a different system.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.890
And then plus a full set of
license reporting and analysis.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.630
Landesk uses a passive agent to
keep track of the software that's

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.550
being launched on a computer,
and to be able to work with the

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.920
inventory scan to go back and say,
what's been run on here?

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.920
So we're managing licenses
through the inventory.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.040
And then we're managing licenses
through the inventory mechanism,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.040
and to be also able to track the licenses
and define what people are using,

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.140
depending upon how you want to
set for just an application or

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.040
for the entire application suite.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.170
To be able to import
specific files for that,

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:23.090
and to be able to manage license
reconciliation over downgrading

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.040
the rights to a specific
application for somebody,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.100
and to be able to apply the different
rights policies that you want,

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.040
depending upon what the user
is going to be allowed to do.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.860
And the console system being able to set
off a warning is a really good thing,

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.860
that when somebody's,
when you violated the license, you know,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.850
it'd be really bad news to be
sitting there with a manager

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.770
looking over your shoulder,
and all of a sudden you

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.690
get an alert that says,
hey, we got a hundred people using

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.860
this 50 user licensed application.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.030
And having the console alert
you that when you break license

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.820
restrictions that it'll let,
it'll give you a heads up on that.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.600
For license management from Altares,
they have a contract management solution

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.630
that will actually track all the various
license settings that you provide.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.520
So you can actually insert which license
agreements apply to different sets,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.560
which warranties are provided.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.800
So in other words, getting an alert that,
hey, I've got a license that's

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.570
warrantied for X number of years,
and here's when it's running out.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.980
And to be able to specify this and
build it into the integration or

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.860
integrate it with the inventory solution
so that we can see later on what's

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.800
going on and get complete inventory
of the status of all my licenses,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.920
of all my systems.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.460
And to be able to provide complete,
and I love the term executive

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.320
versus administrative reporting.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.960
Administrative reporting is
what an IT manager wants.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.690
The executive reporting has
all the funny colors to it.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.380
It's the difference
between the cartoon report.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.850
You know, here, boss, go look at this.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.470
And the one that you need to do your job.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.260
Pretty pictures.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.410
Patching and upgrading.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.030
One of those tasks that
we have to do with,

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.030
you know?

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.030
I mean, despite the fact that we ship
our software and it's perfect,

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.070
There's always somebody that
has to have a patch to it.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.420
So consequently,
FileWave allows us to deal with

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.880
that by having the patches or the
updates that come down through

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.160
the software update server.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.850
I can make them part of a load set
and have them available to my clients.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.820
And I can do it automatically
or I can make it part of a load

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.310
set after I've gone through the
testing process and set that up.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.820
I can also execute the shell scripts,
what we used to call

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.370
payload-free packages.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.560
So now the shell script can be part
of a load set instead or it can

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.260
be part of the package install.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.490
And once again,
the idea is that the client pulls this.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.440
So it's not a matter of saying, hey,
is the client online or not?

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.350
Once I've specified the load set,
the client, when it comes up and

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.040
connects to the network,
will say, hey, I need this.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.380
And it will go and get the package.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.040
Landesk will do patching and
upgrading through its security

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.860
and patch manager interface.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.900
And what that lets us do is either
use their software distribution

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.110
mechanism or the patch manager where
the administrator will download the

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.890
file and create the template for the
update and then make that available

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.690
along with whatever the definitions
are going to be for security updates,

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.060
the vulnerability definitions,
and say under these conditions

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.160
this is when the update will apply.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.740
So,
enough of me talking about this stuff.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.700
What I really want to do is we
want to get the people that use

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.990
this stuff every day up here.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.360
And what we've done is we've
gathered in some customers that

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.780
use this stuff every day and work
with enterprise IT solutions.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:43.140
And I've got three people
that volunteered their time,

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.490
their effort, and we'll get them all into
the beer bash tomorrow night.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.990
Mark Jeffries from Genentech,
David Zubradt from ViacomMTV,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.010
and he promised Paula Abdul.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.500
and Rick Yang from the
Inner Public Group.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.980
I'm going to have them come up here one
at a time and they're going to spend a

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.070
few minutes telling you about how they
deal with enterprise IT management and

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.240
the solutions that they use to fit in.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.540
And we'll start with Mark.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.830
So let's bring Mark up on stage.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.400
Good afternoon.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.640
Well, K2, of all these different little
software management tools

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:31.430
that we're talking about,
Sassafras is closer to the Jeff Hawkins,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:39.540
Donna Dubinsky model of software tools,
or the less is more sort of philosophy,

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:39.540
if you will.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.360
There's too many hairy
people in this audience.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.640
You didn't catch that bald joke.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.450
What's wrong with you people?

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.900
No, seriously.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.700
is diffusing things.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.000
Seriously, the cool thing about K2 is
not so much what it does,

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.610
but rather what it doesn't.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.580
Sassafras went with the approach of,
"Yeah, we could do patch management.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.720
"Yes, we could do package management.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.040
"Yes, we could throw things on your
desktop "and make dancing beauties

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.590
appear and all this other stuff."

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.620
We don't want to do that.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.640
We'll just focus on these core things.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.760
And it really comes down
to what is it that you,

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.600
as an average IT-oid,
would need to do in a given day when

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.630
trying to figure out what do I have?

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.490
How much RAM does it have?

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.070
How big of a drive does it have?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.890
Of that size of a drive,
how much space is on that drive?

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.490
What operating system do I have?

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.440
Which build of that operating
system is on that given machine?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.530
Is that machine here?

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.190
Is it somewhere on the network?

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.200
Then we get to license management.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.120
It's not so much how
many licenses you've got,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.200
but it's really how much
are those licenses used?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.840
That's really the thing that those people
within your organization who look for

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.250
those beautiful multicolored charts,
that's what they're looking for.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.700
Because by finding out license usage,
they can then go to their licensing

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.250
people who put pressure on the
vendors to make them give you the

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.200
software at a decent price instead
of going to the software store.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.690
And they're going to be able to
get the software at a decent price

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.440
instead of gouging you so they can
make their trips out to Hawaii every

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.230
year for the big sales conference.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.520
That's the sort of data that they want.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.630
And that's the sort of stuff that,
in my opinion,

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.800
Sassafras K2 does a really good job with.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.730
Because you can, in a very simple UI,
basically everything happens in one

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.760
unified console where you can see
the number of machines that have

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.990
been called up through the system,
the number of licenses that

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.150
you're tracking and monitoring,
and all the applications that

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.430
have launched at one time
or another on your network.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:51.000
And that's the default mode with K2,
where it will, as soon as,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.540
if you have a K2 client on your machine,
be it Windows, Mac OS, or Linux,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.940
when a person fires an executable off,
that sends a message back off

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.930
to the main console of K2,
which says, application blah, blah,

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.690
blah has been launched on your network.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.280
Now, before your end users start
freaking out and saying,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.420
wait a minute, isn't this spyware?

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.360
Are you monitoring my keystrokes?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.790
Do you want to know what
downloads I've just made?

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.700
Well, the reality of it is that
K2 doesn't do any of that.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.160
It doesn't know that you just pulled
something from hotukranianbabes.com.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.230
It doesn't know that you're actually
doing the PowerPoint presentation

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.160
for your kid's pet show.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.060
All it knows is that you launched it.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.120
And that you used PowerPoint for
approximately 3.4 hours.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.730
And you're part of a user group
of 200 people that in the last

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.270
week have all used PowerPoint for
a minimum of 45 hours.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.320
So then you can now pull this nice
little cute report and hand it back

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.000
off to your pointy-haired boss,
who then says, cool,

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.300
we know that even though we have
300 machines on our network,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.620
or 3,000 machines on our network,
there's actually a lot of power

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.060
points that we can use to do this.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.060
So then you can now pull this nice
little cute report and hand it back

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.060
off to your pointy-haired boss,
who then says, cool,

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.080
we know that even though we have
300 machines on our network,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.860
there's actually only been 150 people
who have used PowerPoint anything

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.020
longer than five hours a day.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.140
You know, we might be able to manage that
license a little bit better.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.670
You can go from just a monitoring of
how many people are using a license

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.660
to actually engaging total fascist
lockdown on a license and saying,

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:33.210
okay, this has been tied to the node
of MAC address 128.137.6.5.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:40.940
This application will no longer launch on
any other machine other than 128.137.6.5.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:46.180
So you can do those sort of things
very lightly with Sassafras.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.260
And the other nice thing about it is
it's built-in bandwidth throttling.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.810
So when it does an audit,
whether you're on a PowerBook or a fully

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.490
tricked out G5 or soon a MacTel box,

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.790
It automatically throttles the amount
of information it needs for the audit.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:10.060
So you could be on a dial-up modem
and it will not overtax the system.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.780
And if you are concerned about
bandwidth on the console,

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.470
you can tell it.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:18.670
I don't want you to hit this user
any more than 60 kilobytes a second.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.720
Now, that means that your audit
is going to be really slow,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.160
but eventually you'll
get that information.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.640
And the nice thing about it,
the end user doesn't notice.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.170
The K2 client runs as root,
so you can actually embed it down.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.590
And if you are running a managed
Macintosh system where you lock root

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:42.710
out so that you basically don't give end
users the license to kill themselves,

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.710
you can actually embed it down.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.670
You can then pretty much make
sure that the client sits

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.340
there and sits there reliably,
and you don't have to worry about it

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.930
being accidentally shut off or somebody
flipping controls on you unexpectedly.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.400
The server itself is
also very lightweight.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:05.130
I mean, you could arguably run a
large-site K2 server on an iMac.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.220
And I'm not talking like
a nice G5 multi-fan,

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.090
super cool, loose-site job.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.780
I'm talking about old-school, bondy blue.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.930
With maybe a 30 gig hard drive on
it and a healthy amount of RAM.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.130
Now, I strongly don't recommend
that you do that and have about

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.830
3,000 clients hit it very hard,
but it can be done.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.760
It doesn't take a lot of
headroom to run a K2 server,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.440
and it runs quite happily.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.120
The console is accessible.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.480
You can be anywhere on your network,
and you can call the console up.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.400
For what it does, now,
there's other applications,

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.500
and we've actually used some
of these others ourselves that

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.100
you'll also hear from today,
and they're real cool,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.900
and they work really great for
the various things that they do.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.750
But when it comes down to very,
very specific things you need to know,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.980
like how many licenses do you have,
how often are they used,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.450
who is using those licenses by, you know,
Unix ID...

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:05.900
And what do their machines have
that you can then quickly turn

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.040
around and turn into a very nice
report for not only your IT people,

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.190
but also for your
pointy-head bosses out there?

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.940
K2 is a very,
very nice package that does all

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.580
this very cleanly and very quickly.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.720
The guys at SAS Press do an excellent job
on customer service and follow-through

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.340
and just making sure that the
application stays very much up-to-date.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.040
Quite personally,
I was very excited when I heard about

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:37.330
them including dashboard widgets because
the reporting widget is real slick.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.040
Because then you don't even
have to call the console.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.720
You just bring your widget up and say,
and your boss comes over

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.360
your shoulder and says,
So where is that usage report in

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.500
regards to the latest software
product that we just got?

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.060
You can quickly pull up
your dashboard and say,

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.570
"Oh, sure, boss, right here." And call
it up and they're like,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.400
"That's most excellent.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.120
You live for another day."

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:05.500
So, all humor aside,
we've been using K2 now since

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.330
its inception back in 1995,
and the product has just continued to

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.290
grow and expand in its capabilities.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.390
But, once again,
going back to that Donna Dubinsky,

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:20.540
Jim Hawkins, Palm Pilot sort of metaphor,
they kept it simple.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.020
And that's really a very attractive
thing in this day and age of ever-growing

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.050
complexity in just the tools that
we use in our day-to-day work.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.100
So,
I'd like to leave it off at that point.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.940
Thank you very much for your time.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.100
Now David tells me that Paula isn't here,
but David Zubradt's from ViacomMTV,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.760
and he's going to come up and tell
you what those guys are doing,

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.270
and you think that
MTV just does music videos?

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.300
No, they do IT.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.990
Now my presentation is going to be more
of an overview of what MTV is about

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.700
and our solution that we have chosen.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.670
And first of all,
I'd like to thank John for

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.240
asking me to speak.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.720
My hope is that your eyes aren't
going to glaze over like my wife's

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.780
do when I talk about my job.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.900
And you'll see, hopefully,
that I think we're

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.160
probably in the same boat.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.120
If you're in enterprise IT,
I think we kind of

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.000
have the same problems,
I'm guessing.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.340
Again, I am with MTV Networks,
1515 Broadway, Manhattan, New York,

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.740
Times Square.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.760
More specifically, MTV Networks IS&T,
which means we don't have

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.140
the big flashy offices,
we have the beige offices and the

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.480
gopher farm and all that kind of stuff.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:59.930
But MTV itself,
MTV Networks itself is MTV, VH1,

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:06.770
Nickelodeon, Spike TV, Comedy Central,
and our newest channel, Logo,

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.500
which will be coming, hopefully,
to your cable lineups.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.560
We provide central support and
purchasing for all of MTV Networks.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.940
And of course,
that means our challenges are that

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:24.960
we have to provide quick service,
tested and up-to-date software.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.590
More challenges.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.640
We need to control our IS&T operations.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.660
As probably your case,
it's probably the same thing.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.860
We don't make money for the enterprise.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.570
We suck money from the enterprise.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.760
Yeah.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.870
So we're always having to, you know,
freeze our hiring while our customers,

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:47.080
they keep adding, you know,
Nickelodeon's going to add 100

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.040
more graphic artists over here.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.870
We're like, uh,
but we have 10 people out of 1,000.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.380
So we're always worried about that.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.010
We're trying to control that.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.260
And we're trying to find solutions
so we don't have to go out there

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.980
all the time to every desk and say,
oh, Creative Suite 2 has come out.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.380
That's 4.4 gigabytes of information.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.820
I'm going to have to go
out to this person's desk,

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.890
this person's desk, and install.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.150
And we also need to keep
track of what is installed,

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.640
what is on our network.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:25.940
We also need to respond to quick changes
in our enterprise like virus updates.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:30.840
Hopefully we're moving that over to EPO.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.940
We're going to use the new Virex.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.760
So actually we won't have to
worry about that much anymore,

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.580
which is a big load off my shoulders.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.940
Network changes.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.930
I don't know.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:44.700
Our network people don't really like to
talk to the Macintosh people that much.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.700
It might be like your enterprise.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.280
I'm not sure.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.500
But they can't understand.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.010
These are the people that
can't understand why an end

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:57.970
user would have a one gigabyte
EPS file that they're working on.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:07.240
And why 500 gigabytes of network space
isn't enough for 100 graphic users.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.910
And it doesn't matter.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.270
We explain to it over and over again.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.900
It's the same thing every day.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:18.980
They're dealing with
multiple gigabyte EPS files.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.550
And we also things like Sarbanes-Oxley.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:27.680
Our company is really strict
about detailing everything

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.960
about Sarbanes-Oxley.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.600
Everything.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.200
We're detailing everything.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.790
And did I mention that
we're detailing everything?

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.920
60-day password change,
which also includes 60-day password

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.550
change of our local admin accounts
on all of the Mac OS Xs out there.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.430
Every 60 days.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.980
Every 60 days.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:56.080
Okay, so our solution that we chose,
and we chose them a long time ago,

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.690
is FileWave.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.360
I've been working with FileWave
since I started MTV in 2000,

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.560
which was the old OS 9 version.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.800
We're now using only OS X.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.360
We've shut off OS 9 support.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.500
That way, people who are still hiding
and hoarding their OS 9 units,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.390
like the Bondi iMacs and
the blue and white G3s,

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.100
will eventually call
our help desk and say,

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.840
I can't do anything, and I need help.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.670
So, again, we've chosen FileWave.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:38.440
In our data center, we have four Xserves,
four G4 Xserves with dual 133s,

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.020
one gigabyte of RAM,
and they're on our gigabit backbone.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.160
So we have four of them.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.820
Three of them are
actually FileWave itself,

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.060
FileWave proper.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.180
We have one as the main.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.190
The main server,
two that are our logon servers,

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.260
or they're called boosters now,
that express software out to people.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.480
And then we have one Xserve
that runs our asset management,

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.030
which is called Asset
Trustee with FileWave,

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.920
which uses PHP and MySQL is
back in now instead of 4D.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.620
Sorry, 4D.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:13.110
Thank God 4D is gone from our system.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.840
Our user base right now,
we have approximately 1,000

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.450
Macintosh computers at five
different sites in New York City.

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:30.530
We also have approximately 150
production boxes that we don't touch.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.620
They're not on our network,
not allowed on our network.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.920
They stay off our network.

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:38.150
We're not going to support them.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.350
They don't like us to support them.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.280
They're very protective about it,
and we like it that way.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.290
So it works out for both of us.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:51.170
We keep strict standards,
strict minimums for our desktop users.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:56.170
Our current minimums right now,
if you have a desktop dual G4 500,

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.620
you can keep it.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.060
We have 768 megs of
RAM and 30 gig hard drive.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.630
That's going to be a secretary
now using that system,

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.300
whereas a few years ago that was,
you know, it.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.880
Our laptops have to be G4s.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:12.500
They have to be.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.940
Again, 768 megs of RAM,
20 gigabyte hard drive.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:21.200
If you have that,
you can have OS X on our network.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.490
More about Macs in MTV Networks.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.870
They provide 95% of the content
that you see on television.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.800
And we only make up
10% of the population,

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.960
total computer population,
in MTV Networks.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.370
Of course,
we're still second-class citizens.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:39.440
They don't care.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.180
Of course, when the big virus went out on
the PC side a couple years ago,

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.020
all the Macs were still working.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.360
And that did not fall on deaf ears
when the CFO was asking about that.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.440
Because money was going down the tubes
that day for their business units.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.650
Yeah, now the good,
what I like to call the good, the bad,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.990
and the ugly about FileWave.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.220
The good, again,
John has mentioned this before,

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.360
it's a pull technology.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.840
If a machine's not on the network
at the time or is shut off,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.520
when it comes back on,
it logs into the main repository,

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.930
pulls down what they call a manifest,
and says, oh, okay, here's what I need,

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.600
or oh, this package is updated,
and will pull it.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.720
So if a laptop is home for three months,
it comes back on the network,

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.990
or they VPN in into our network,
they'll get it.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:39.120
And luckily, our VPN is separated into
broadband and dial-up.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.680
So only broadband users
will get the updates.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.760
We won't update on 56K.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.320
Or 336.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.680
If you know anything about
telephones in New York City,

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:59.150
sometimes you're lucky to get 14.4 out
of the old system that's out there.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:04.580
We have a 99.9% success
rate on everything we push.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:10.310
I'm not going to say 100%, though
I do like 100%. I just think

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.220
you wouldn't believe 100%, so
I just dropped it down to 99.9.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:17.210
Our first push was
Timbuk2 in the old OS 9,

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.530
OS 8 days.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:23.720
We had 100% success on that,
and it was instant.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.710
We pushed it out with all the
preferences that we wanted with

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:31.740
admin account that we could log in,
and our help desk was immediately able

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.260
to start remote support for users.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:35.800
It was great.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:41.130
The bad,
the packages we distribute are live.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.420
They're live, live, live.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:49.370
If you mess it up for one,
you mess it up for everybody.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380
Sorry, Norbert.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.280
So we test it, test it, test it.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.960
I have a bank of lab machines
that I test all my applications

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.270
on before I push it out.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:58.580
Test, test, test.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.950
And again, one more test I think
is adequate for that.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:03.750
Here's the ugly.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.540
The initial install is a desktop visit,
or if you have a remote

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.500
desktop opportunity.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.280
So it's easier if you have a remote
desktop on the machines already.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:19.140
And it's also easier if you already
use the sharing name as the--

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.000
As the client ID,
which of course we chose not to do.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.220
We chose a complicated one.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.640
So if you have more
questions at the end of this,

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.600
I'm happy to answer these for you.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.400
Thanks, John.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:41.920
So next person coming up here,
we're going to bring Rick Yang up

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.080
here from Interpublic Group.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.400
And Rick has a rather unique
opportunity to tell you how,

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.700
in IT, how to herd cats.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.040
What do you do when you have lots and
lots of different companies that you

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.560
have to provide IT management for?

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.090
So let's welcome Rick up here.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.770
All right.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.570
My name is Rick.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.900
I work for Interpublic Group,
and I'm responsible for setting

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.120
hardware and software standards
on the Macintosh platform.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.530
I'm going to give you a quick
background of Interpublic,

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.870
your understanding of why
some of our challenges and

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.610
how and why we use Lendesk.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:26.800
Interpublic Group of companies is
comprised of 87 divisions of advertising,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.040
media, all kinds of marketing companies.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.890
All these 87 divisions
own a lot more companies.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:43.530
We really, it's hundreds of companies and
Interpublic is a holding company.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.400
In our enterprise,
we have about 45,000 computers,

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.450
of which 15,000 to 20,000 are Macintosh.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.440
And once we fully deploy LANDESK,
we can get a very

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.580
accurate number of that.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.910
Round right now, we're not sure.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:10.570
And quick history on Airpublic
is all these companies really

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.300
operate very individually.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.240
None of them really collaborated.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.700
Every company's got
its own IT department,

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.090
its own CIO, the whole whole thing.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.560
Everybody does his own thing.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.930
So about two years ago,
we hired a consulting

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:35.200
company to come in and,
you know, go around every office,

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.020
find out what everybody's using,
the systems, the software,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:43.160
ask all the IT guys,
what do you guys really do around here,

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.360
that kind of stuff.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.680
And a lot of information came out.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.590
And one of the more shocking
example is Interpublic uses about

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.040
400 different financial apps.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.150
And that was, I mean,
it's always been a nightmare

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:07.460
for a corporate to collect an
output accurate financial data.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.850
Around that time,
what consulting company would do?

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.850
Consolidate, centralize your IT.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.960
We're like, "Okay,
let's do that." So two years ago,

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.510
we formed a group called GIS,
which stands for

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.900
Global Information Services,
within Interpublic.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:32.410
The goal is we have one organization
to support all IT functions for

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:35.750
all these companies as a whole.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.800
[Transcript missing]

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:49.450
We finally started to
form the GIS companies and

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.670
There's three main goals
we want to accomplish,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.500
at least on the desktop side.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.540
We want to create hardware
and software standards because

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.370
pretty much at that time,
anything under the sun was being used.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.970
Every company's got its own solutions.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:10.260
Every company's got -- using
all kinds of vendors out there.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.250
And another big problem was

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.100
Every company is really
doing their own thing,

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:24.170
meaning everybody's researching,
evaluating, implementing systems that

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.340
pretty much does the same thing.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.520
So, standards is important.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.570
And the second thing we want to do,
we want to create a central service

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:41.530
desk to support all of the users,
regardless which companies you're from.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:52.960
So at that time,
we created standards for our group.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.820
And standard was very important,
as you'll see,

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.040
for an organization like us,
because it was not possible to

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:05.630
operate if you don't have standards,
precision policies, and desktops,

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.980
and softwares.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.570
So--

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:16.910
We created a central
service desk in New York.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:21.070
And that service desk
is level one support.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:26.450
By doing this,
we freed up the field techs

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.960
to do more deployments,
to research other projects.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.110
And we have really great
success with our central service

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:36.630
desk right now in New York,
and we have one in London to

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.800
support our EMEA offices.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.750
We are currently closing 40%
of first call resolution,

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.960
meaning 40% of tickets are being called.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.910
on a by user call-in, and it's done.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.870
Ticket closed.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:00.420
The system we're using
for our service is Remedy,

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.400
and we integrate that into LANDESQ.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.810
for using mainly the search that's using
the remote control components of it.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:19.420
And another major component
of LANDESK we're using is the

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.470
asset management part of it.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:26.600
Because before that, we really don't know
what we got out there.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.140
I mean,
because of so many offices we have,

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.560
we have constantly closing of office,
opening a new office,

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.150
consolidating real estate.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:45.890
IT managers are constantly being asked
for inventory of what you guys have.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.900
Different managers have different ways.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.490
Some have better systems.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:55.550
Some are literally, "Okay,
I'll go around and start collecting

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.810
information." And by the time

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.540
You got your, you know,
information started coming in,

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.460
somebody's asking for it again because
it's probably not accurate already.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:11.600
So it was impossible until we can
have something that can just set

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.930
all the information in for us.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.470
And we are also using software
distribution and patch

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.800
management components of LANDESQ.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.850
Now this is, it was really,
it was extremely important for us to set

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:33.210
hardware standards just to accomplish
this part because you've got to imagine,

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.750
If we didn't have a standard,
patching and software is

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.940
just going to be hard.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.840
By setting software standards,
now we have a manageable set

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.840
of software that we can deploy.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.060
By setting OS standards,
now the patching is manageable.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:58.050
By having one antivirus is better because
we were using probably anything you guys

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.850
ever heard of among these companies.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:10.940
And actually, we, on ARD,
on Apple's remote desktop,

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:15.190
we are still using that in
conjunction with LANDESK because

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.900
it is an extremely nice tool.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.040
Even though we have LANDESK on
the enterprise side,

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.870
our remote desktop was being used by
the local admin because it does some

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:29.700
things that is very easy and very fast,
even though it could be

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:31.360
accomplished in LANDESK.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.350
Stuff like sending a UNIX command,
just copy a file to someone's desktop.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:41.060
So, we still have use for
ARD in our environment.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.990
And also,
LANDESK also required a visit to the

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:50.900
desktop first time for installing agent,
and we use ARD for that,

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.640
which is a great time saver.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:03.620
And lastly,
we are currently evaluating-- well,

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:09.340
we have an active directory now
that we're ready to pull all these

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.300
companies in as our directory service.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.980
So we are currently evaluating
extending our schema so we can

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.620
further use Workroom Manager to
manage MCX and all the preference,

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.480
because control is good.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.180
You want more and more control.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:32.600
[Transcript missing]

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.570
Now that we have software standard,
now we can technically build a base

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:43.140
image for all these companies and
then use software distribution on our

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:47.940
LANDESK to push out all the individual
apps all these different companies use.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:52.380
And I just learned that,
I just recently learned that LANDESK on

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:57.930
the next release will have an imaging
component to it and profile migration,

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.140
which is, it's really exciting.

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.150
And there are three of them here,
so feel free to talk to

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.820
them about the new features,
I guess.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.410
And that's it.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.020
Thank you.

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:20.380
So, to finish up,
what we're going to do is we're going to,

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:23.240
I've got a couple more slides,
and then we're going to break

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.500
down into two levels of Q&A.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.030
I'm going to get Rick and David and
Mark back up here to answer some

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.850
of your more specific questions
about some of their hot spots and

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.340
pain that they've gone through.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.930
And then what we'll do is
then release everybody,

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:41.070
and I've got representatives from the
different companies here who will also

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:44.300
gather up at the end of the stage,
since we're the only thing between

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.580
you and Chevy's happy hour.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.680
So, we're going to get everybody back up
here to be able to answer additional

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.740
questions when we get done.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.010
But to wrap this up,
one of the things I wanted

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.010
to point out was that,
you know,

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:58.410
these are four significant players in the
enterprise management market and very,

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.280
very good players in this.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.220
But there are also other companies
that fit into this task list,

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.460
too, and let's not forget about all
the other people that come out.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.020
And we couldn't possibly cover
everybody that's out there that

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.340
provides solutions in the Mac space.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.040
So, there's an awful lot of people out
there doing an awful lot of work.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.040
And I'm going to get Rick and
David Zubradt back up here to

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.090
answer some of their hot spots and
pain that they've gone through.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.830
And providing some very,
very good solutions for

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.520
all of the different tasks.
