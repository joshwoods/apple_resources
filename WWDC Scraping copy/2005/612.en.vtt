WEBVTT

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640
Well, we're going to begin off with
the hand mic and then we're going

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.200
to move to the body mic here,
it sounds like.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.630
My name is Damien Weiss.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.200
I work for the
Enterprise Consulting Group.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.400
We're going to talk about moving
to Tiger Server from Windows.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.390
This is going to be a mainly
NT-focused presentation.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.270
So first I want to begin off,
when we were writing the presentation,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.170
we were really doing this,
we really sat down and tried to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.340
figure out who the main audience was.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.830
And really we came up
with one of three groups.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.940
And as an audience participation,
I'd like to get the old raising of the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.960
hands just to see who we have here.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.960
I had a bet on who the majority would be.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.900
So the first group is the Windows admins.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.960
You know who you are.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.100
Go ahead, raise your hands.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.030
See it?

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.730
Wow.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.800
Not bad, not bad.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.790
You guys are probably trying to figure
out a way of getting out of Windows,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.520
maybe.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.860
Maybe.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.000
Maybe not.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.760
We'll see.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.100
The Mac programmers are admins who
are here trying to figure out a way to

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.990
convince their managers we can do it.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.290
I swear we can.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.940
A few.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.780
A few more.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.190
And then finally a consultant who's just
trying to figure out a way of making,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.260
doing this for their customers.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.030
It's actually evenly split,
pretty evenly split,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.530
a little bit more heavily
towards the Mac side.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.550
I was actually thinking that it
would be nearly 90% Mac side,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.340
so a little surprised by that.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.440
So for all of y'all,
you probably want to figure out a way

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.400
of ending the server licensing fees.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.210
And we're going to take a
break and we're going to think

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.010
about ending licensing fees.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.190
Keep talking.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.510
And figuring out a way to
have a server that integrates.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.700
And then finally, a-- there we go.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.290
And finally, getting a server you don't
hear about on the news.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.840
I tell you,
it's bad news when you have your

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.310
parents call you up and say,
"Is this machine that I'm

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.300
running on my desktop?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.530
I heard about it on Channel 7 tonight.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.300
Is everything all right?"
It's always bad news.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.300
So, in other words,
you have something like this, probably.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.730
You've got a lot of Windows boxes,
the occasional one Mac that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.760
might be your machine,
and a big,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.190
hunkin' Windows box in the middle.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.650
What you want is a drop-in replacement,
something really easy,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.540
and that's what we're here to do.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.580
And most of all,
you want it without this,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.240
without the axe-wielding users.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.250
This is a -- I used to work at a bank,
and this was a common

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.870
problem that we had.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.900
So how do you get there?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.840
Well, since we're at WWDC 2005,
of course,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.900
the answer is going to be Tiger Server.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.990
In fact,
it's even in the title of this session.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.700
So, for most of you,
this is going to be a review,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.140
but I just wanted to
go over it real fast.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.700
What is Tiger Server?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.000
We're going to talk
about a few things here.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.840
First off, we all know,
we should all know it's Unix-based,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.380
right?

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.300
It's open source out the wazoo.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.330
I love this phrase.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.000
Everything just about is open source,
it seemed like,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.670
especially on the server side.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.980
So many of those projects
open sourced out.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.620
It integrates very well.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.930
There's very little issue
getting it to integrate with

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.680
most of the other projects.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.700
It's very standard stuff.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.750
And for the non-standard stuff,
there's a little bit of work involved,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.230
but still very well to integrate.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.420
And it's very reliable.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.080
Ten years ago,
if you were to ask me if we could

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.790
have a Unix-based machine that
I could ever get on stage in front

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.810
of folks and say is reliable,
I would have had a hard time doing it.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.630
But we've really done a really good job.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.290
And same thing with secure.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.120
We've really taken security and
really built it into the machine.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.190
We administrate it through
three different applications,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.720
right?

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.060
First one for hardware administration,
we use server monitor.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.770
It looks something like this.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.900
We're monitoring the fans
on this machine right now.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.100
Everything's green, which is good.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.460
For server processes,
we're using Server Admin to

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.250
monitor the processes and to
go ahead and configure them.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.100
And finally,
Workgroup Manager for looking at and

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.100
configuring users and share points and
for other items such as manage client.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.290
So what have you got?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.700
Well,
this is the server installation circa,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.000
what, 1996, 1997, somewhere around there.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.000
We've got a 4.0 box, PDC on it,
network drives exchange.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.610
And what we're going to do is
we're going to place the NT.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.200
will be replaced by Samba.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.200
Exchange will be replaced
by our own mail product.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.190
There are other good mail
products out there also.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.200
And finally,
IIS will be banished forever by Apache.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.200
That will be a good thing.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:35.330
I'm happy about it too, believe me.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800
So what have we got on
this migration path?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.800
Well,
we have some Windows machines and for our

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.800
migration here we're going to represent
this with our three Windows boxes.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.800
And down here we've got
our 3x serves and our

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:49.700
[Transcript missing]

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.700
So let's take a look.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.300
First, we have to prepare the PDC, right?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.400
So we're going to talk about this.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.000
What is a PDC versus a BDC?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Now, for the Windows guys in there,
this is probably review.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.180
The Apple folks, maybe, maybe not.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.200
PDC is the primary domain controller.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.070
You have one per domain.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.190
If you have a small enough company,
that's one per network.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200
Contains all your login
and password information,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200
amongst other information.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.570
It's read/write, and generally,
you try to make this thing as big and

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.200
as hunking as a box as you can get,
and you hope it doesn't break down.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.260
For that, you have BDCs,
which are the backup domain controllers,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.200
really just replicas of that primary.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.020
You have as many as you want.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.190
And it contains a copy of
the login and password.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.200
And those two really talk to each other,
right?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.200
There's a trust relationship
between those two,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.430
and the BDC grabs copies from the PDC,
and it has all the information it needs.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.370
So on the Tiger side,
what we do is-- same thing here--

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.060
Windows under Server Admin.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.950
What you do is you have a pop-up there,
and it's set currently for

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.670
primary domain controller,
or the PDC.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:08.020
And if we wanted to have it act as a BDC,
we could flip that.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.030
Now, the important thing to know
here is that if you are setting

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.790
up a Tiger Server as a PDC,
you need to make sure that your open

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.920
directory is set to being a master.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.150
If you're setting up a BDC,
you need to make sure you

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.590
have open directory replica.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.990
If there's one thing you take
from this presentation today,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.380
please remember that.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.030
So the next step, migrating the users.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.400
So this is where we are, right?

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.300
We've got a Windows box there
logging in to the PDC or the BDC,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.900
just depending.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.600
And so on boot up, as it says,
it's going to find that PDC.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.600
It's going to attempt to log in.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.630
PDC is going to say, oh, okay,
no problem.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.920
Let's find a home directory.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.800
Finds a home directory
and everything's in.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.920
And really what we want to do is we just
want to drop in and replace to the point

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.960
where the client doesn't notice anything.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.980
It's the same steps.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.580
I mean, look,
it's just doing the exact same steps.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.440
We can do that.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.900
It's not an issue.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.200
As you can see, we've got an LDAP cloud
above those XSERVs,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.940
and that's where all that
information is going to be stored.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.590
How we do that is with
the NT migration tool.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.630
This is new with Tiger.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.440
It's in user S bin directory.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.400
It's a shell script that executes
a number of server admin,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.920
command line server admin commands,
and Samba-based commands.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.500
And what's good here is
that it integrates with

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.940
Open Directory right out of the box.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.500
We've done a very good job with this one.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.930
And again, that's Apple taking open
source out the wazoo and doing

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.960
something very good with it.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.940
Actually,
I want to add a little bit to that.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.340
About six months ago,
I was actually researching this,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.800
and I was reading a lot of
the online documentation

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.670
that was outside of Apple's,
and I was reading the steps

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.120
that folks were going through
in order to integrate this,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.940
and it was tough.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.600
It raised the hairs on the back of my
head just reading the documentation.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.390
And so, I really appreciate the fact that
engineering got together and said,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.320
"How can we make this
easier for folks?" So,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.370
Inti Migration Tool, how do we use it?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.420
What do we do?

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.250
Well, here's the syntax up here.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.630
What we do is we'll just type
in the shell script followed

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.800
by the Inti domain name,
the server name of the PDC,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:32.700
the domain admin, and then finally the
LDAP admin on your 10 server.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.590
It will take all that information
and it will also insert in some of

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:43.780
its own information and store these
things into varsible Samba temporarily.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.720
including the passwords
for these accounts.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.840
It will then go into lookupd,
flush the cache, so that way we know

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.140
we're dealing with real,
live, honest-to-goodness data,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.210
which is always very important.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.320
And then finally,
it will execute the heart of it,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.840
which is the net vampire command.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.940
Now, what this does is it
emulates being a BDC.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.820
It fools the PDC into
thinking it's a BDC.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.160
It copies all that information
because the PDC thinks,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.400
great, this is it.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.500
This is my honest-to-goodness BDC.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.790
I'm just going to copy
all the information.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.400
Nothing gets unencrypted.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.300
Nothing happens to the data.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.120
It's just the data as it was on the PDC.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.520
And then that's it.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.340
And then we're done.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.790
So finally we're going to move,
or not finally, but next we're going to

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.700
move to Home Directory.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.470
So there's two ways of doing this, right?

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.800
Or there's actually more than two ways.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.500
There's several ways of doing this,
but there are two primary

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.610
ways that I see of doing this.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.490
My favorite way personally is
just to mount the NT server,

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.500
do a recursive ditto,
and just be done with it.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.790
Go in, make sure that the permissions
are kosher afterwards.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.780
If everything's good to go,
everyone's happy.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.200
And this works 99% of the time.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.760
The other way that a lot of folks like
to do is do the external hard drive

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.170
and sneak or net it to the new server.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.740
It's really up to you.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.940
Once you have those users in there,
we can modify a lot of the home directory

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.430
information within Workgroup Manager.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.680
So, you know, we can set the home
directory drive letter.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.430
We can set the user profile paths,
the login script.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.530
All that stuff is settable
within the Windows panel.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.480
Excuse me.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.460
Oh, yes, within the Windows panel,
Workgroup Manager.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.100
Next step is turn on the Windows service.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.890
So at this point,
we have prepared the server.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.740
We've set it up as an
open directory master.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.890
We've migrated the user
authentication data.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.080
We've moved the home directories,
and now we're going to go ahead

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.720
and turn on that Windows service
and turn this machine,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.610
make it into a PDC, a full-fledged PDC.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.650
So what we do is, again, server admin,
Windows panel, flip this over to PDC,

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.720
and hit start.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.280
Make sure that the
domain name is correct.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.220
Important.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.670
Seeing customers who did not
set the domain name correctly

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.370
and bad things result.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.560
And that's it.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.120
You're done.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.260
The one thing that you need to do is
be sure to turn off the Windows box.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:30.150
So we gray out the old Windows box there,
and now we have our XServe online.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.780
The next thing that we're going
to talk about is mail migration.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.570
And mail isn't as clean of a solution.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.460
And I think most of us know this.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.690
Mail is tough, right?

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.450
There is no good way of doing it,
in my opinion.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.260
But the best way that I've
seen is the IMAP to IMAP copy.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.160
So on Exchange,
turn on your IMAP compatibility mode.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.660
It's there in Exchange 5.5
and further on.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:05.060
Not there in versions before 5.5.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:12.370
And what you do is you log in to
the server as one of your users.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.700
You go ahead and you
create the entries within,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.640
let's say,
mail.app for both the IMAP servers,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.640
both the Exchange server and
now your new XServe server.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.970
And you just copy all that mail
from one server to the other.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.200
It's not as clean of a solution
as I would like at this point,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.300
but it is a good solution
and it does work,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.800
and we have other things that
we're going to talk about later on.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.800
So that's mail.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800
On to printing.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.580
Printing is easy, right?

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.900
If you still have printers
hooked up to Windows queues,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.900
this is really easy.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.400
We turn on SMB and you're done.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.900
That's it.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.690
You set up the queues,
you turn on SMB and that's it.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.290
Now, what we get out of this and what
I think is more important is for free,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.700
you get the Internet Printing Protocol,
Apple Talk and LPR all for free,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.900
just right out of the box,
just for using our product.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.650
And that's just a great
value add for the server.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.240
So another Windows box put into storage.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.540
It's gone.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.520
Another XServe online.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.930
And finally, the web service.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.770
This is also pretty darned easy.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.500
What you need to do is just copy your
files into library web server documents.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.020
And for the three of you that
are still using the index.htm

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.890
instead of HTML reference,
no problem.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.280
You can add that index.htm
to the default index files.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.790
It will take care of that.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.290
You don't need to go in and recursively
change each one of your web pages

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.000
and worry about those things.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.280
It's just taken care of for you.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.720
We have built-in certificates.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.370
In previous versions in Panther,
for instance, doing the certificates

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.090
was a little gnarly.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.030
Not so here now.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:12.060
We actually ship a self-signed
certificate with the server.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.700
works very well.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.200
You need to just go ahead and go
into certificate and select default.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.700
For new certificates,
it's just as easy as adding

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.570
in or clicking and getting
custom configuration,

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.350
and the pop-up panel comes in and then
filling out all the standard information

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.700
that you receive from your CA.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.460
Another Windows machine is gone into
the closet and truly a world that

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.990
has been rid of three Windows boxes.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.690
But that's not it.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.890
Remote management.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:52.830
For those of you who would have one Mac,
two Macs, or maybe zero Macs,

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.290
and this is just a server,
a lot of you don't want to have

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.260
to haul down to the server room
in order to make any changes,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:00.900
right?

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.400
Many of us don't want to
have just a dedicated Mac.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.960
I would like that.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.540
That would be great.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.850
But, you know,
a dedicated Mac just to manage a

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.790
server seems a little bit wasteful.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.770
You can SSH in, of course,
use the command line

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.400
server admin command.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.100
They've really done a good job with this.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.270
So, for instance, in this example,
I went ahead and I just wanted to

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.100
see what the status of Samba was.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.270
In this case, it stopped.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.500
Simple enough.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.180
Wanted to get a full status of it,
and so it dumped out a large amount of

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:35.210
data amongst it that it stopped still,
but also some of the configuration

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.930
data that it is aware of.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.580
Then also wanted to see
what else I could do.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.950
So I went ahead and said, well,
let's start the process.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.000
Why not?

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.600
Just shoots right back that it's running.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.180
All in command line,
no problems whatsoever.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.600
Stopped it again.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.680
Not an issue.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.470
I wanted to change some of the settings,
for instance.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.680
I wanted to change where the
Samba log was being placed onto.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:15.770
And I wanted to place it onto the RAID,
so use the command line.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780
All this stuff is in there.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:15.780
It's within server admin.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:15.780
If you just say server
admin settings SMB,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:15.780
it will dump out every
setting that it knows about.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:15.780
You can just as easily change
it on the command line.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.130
If I want to change the server
string or if I just want to

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.600
see what the server string was,
not an issue.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.050
It's there.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:33.000
[Transcript missing]

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.300
The solution is also the
server admin command.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.940
What I've done here is I went ahead and
just simply said server admin command,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.760
XSERV command equals status,
and it drops out a large amount of data.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.560
There's a lot of -- not a lot,
but there's a couple of scripts out

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.800
there that can take this and translate
this into something human readable.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.800
But I just wanted to go ahead and
take a quick look and see what we had.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.800
So I went ahead and did this.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.800
You can see what the temperature
behind the CPU1 ambient was.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.730
And as you can see,
it spewed out 1,900,544.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.320
An engineer told me that the way
to decode this into something more

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:21.960
English readable was to divide by 65,536,
and you get your answer in Celsius.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.610
I almost, on the slide,
almost then did the

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.900
conversion into Fahrenheit,
but I figured I'd leave well

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:36.410
enough alone and maybe actually
learn the metric system.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.120
supporters of metric system.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.600
Good.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.490
So also we can find out what version
of the operating system it's running.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.400
As you can see,
it just says it's running 10.4,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.870
even the OS build number.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.210
So that's, what is that?

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.140
That's 8A428,
which for some reason I have

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.300
memorized as being 10.4.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.240
And finally, also the serial number.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.260
There's a lot of customers who
come to me and they ask me,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.620
they say, hey,
how can I find out the serial

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.500
number of this box without actually
having to visit it and locate it?

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.970
I want to do this scriptably.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.580
This is the answer.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.690
Also,
if you want to do graphic management,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.770
well, you've got your Windows box
and you want to graphically

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.200
administer your XServe or your Mac.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.090
It's not an issue.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:29.470
We ship within ARD a VNC server,
go into System Preferences, Sharing,

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.640
Apple Remote Desktop.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.200
And you turn it on.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.400
And using a client like
RealVNC or FreeVNC,

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.700
you go ahead and you can
control your Mac server and

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.070
it's not an issue whatsoever.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.700
And you turn it on.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.880
And using a client like
RealVNC or FreeVNC,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.200
you go ahead and you can
control your Mac server and

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.440
it's not an issue whatsoever.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.800
You still can't figure
out how to tell it that.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.840
So it pops up this thing every
single time I turn it on.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.890
It drives me insane.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.220
But that's not all.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.300
As we all know, DNS, we can do it.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.700
DHCP, Jabber Server,
which is the instant messaging

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.290
server that there was a great
presentation a little while ago about.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.300
NAT services, Firewall, FTP, VPN.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.590
Truly, it can be the Swiss Army knife
of your network.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.300
It can do it all.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.390
Now,
back to that mail drop and replacement.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.290
There's also a couple other
things I haven't mentioned.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.290
Groupware, calendaring.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.240
There's some great third-party
products out there.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.640
Cario and Communicate do an excellent,
excellent job of mail service,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.300
and MeetingMaker does a great
job on the calendaring side.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.270
And I strongly recommend that if you're
not getting what you need from us,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.300
take a look at these folks.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.300
They do a great job.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.300
Great job.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.080
I highly recommend them.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:23.070
So for other resources,
just go to the WWDC website.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.980
There are related sessions to this one.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.640
There was, of course,
the overview that happened and

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.380
the Active Directory integration.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.600
These are excellent sessions.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.890
More.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.900
The ARD and management practices.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.760
And there's the upcoming extending and
securing mail services using Mac OS X.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:45.100
If anyone's interested in mail securing,
this is it.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.540
I got a sneak peek at some of the slides.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:54.000
I wasn't supposed to,
but I sort of peeked at a couple of

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.020
them and I was actually blown away
by how good this is going to be.
