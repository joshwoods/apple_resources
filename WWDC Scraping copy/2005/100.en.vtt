WEBVTT

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.050
All right, well good morning.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.900
We got a full house here today.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.900
My name is John Geleynsse.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.900
I manage the software evangelism,
software technology evangelism team,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.900
sorry.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
And I'm also the user
experience evangelist at Apple,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.900
so I'm sort of the interface police,
Aquaman, you know, call me what you will.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.880
But hopefully,
I bet you I've worked with many

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.900
of you in the audience here.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.040
I'd love to see a show of hands
of people that have already

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.880
talked to me in the last year.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.880
So we got at least 30
people in this room.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.230
I would say over the last five years
of my being at Apple in this role,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.790
I've worked with close to,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.410
I would guess about 125
to 150 companies a year,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.540
and so I've touched about 600 developers.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.520
And we have worked, you know,
through every dialogue, every menu,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.180
every window,
and it's just been a great experience.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.540
And I love doing this job,
and I hope that comes

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.900
across in the session.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.730
And if you have not met with me,
I encourage you to find me

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.960
sometime during the show or
send me an email after the show.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.060
I also encourage you to go
to the Interface Design Lab,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.020
which is down at the end
of this hall on the right.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.160
We start today at noon,
and I want to encourage you to go there,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.880
sign up for half an hour if you've
got just a couple of simple questions,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.240
or sign up for an hour slot.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.420
You'll be meeting with either myself or
people who are far more talented than me,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.930
who are the guys and ladies who
created the interface for MacÂ OSÂ X,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.320
the Aqua Design team.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.020
And they can give you fantastic feedback.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.130
Don't feel shy.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.160
They're not going to kill you.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.100
In fact, they're probably going to be
gentler on you than I will be.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.980
Which is why this session is called
Cutting Edge Interface Design.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.140
I hope no one bleeds in this session,
and we'll have a lot of fun.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.300
And the point of the whole thing
is to teach you guys how to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.500
create really great products.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.820
Alright, we're going to go about this
with sort of three major steps.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.300
Alright, to create a really great
product on the platform,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.040
which of course is going to have a great,
you know, sensational user interface,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.270
you need to start with something,
you need to start by

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.280
defining your product.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.890
And defining your product is deciding
what to do and who to do it for.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.380
The first step in this process
is understanding your users.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.260
If you were in this session last year,
I touched on some of this content.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.500
Don't worry, this will not be a repeat
of last year's session.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.630
But this stuff is so important,
I want to cover it again.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.670
Understanding your user base is critical.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.250
And this doesn't mean you
have to do $100,000 studies,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.090
doesn't mean you have to get two-way
labs with mirrors and all this stuff,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.060
like you may have read about elsewhere.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.020
It just means taking the time
to do the analysis and think

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.810
about who your customers are.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.370
What are their goals?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.160
What do they hope to accomplish with
the product that you're building?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.500
Right?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.740
What is their workflow?

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.920
What are they trying to finish?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.530
You know, at the end of the day,
what's the problem that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.250
they're trying to do?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.250
What are their needs?

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.060
What's required for them
to get the task done,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.910
basically?

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.260
Don't try to be everything for everybody.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.230
Figure out exactly what you want to do,
what your product is going to do,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.580
and develop it
specifically for that goal.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.140
Users often don't know what they want.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.570
If you're in consulting,
you know what it's like to talk

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.810
to a customer and they say,
oh yeah, here's the spec,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.710
you need to build this and
that and the other thing,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.610
and so you go off and, you know,
like a good contractor, you build it,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.200
and then you show it to them.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.050
What happens?

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.660
That's not what they wanted.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.740
Well, that's because the whole design
process is a really complicated thing

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.010
where people tend to have to look
at something tangible and interact

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.690
with it and then they realize,
oh no, this isn't what I wanted.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:07:32.400
[Transcript missing]

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.750
Once you understand the market
you're going to go after,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.260
and you've kind of hit the bullet points
of which attributes you want to aim for,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.430
then it's critical for you to
sort of prioritize those things.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.660
Because at the end of the day,
you've got a bunch of work to do,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.220
and you've got to decide what you're
going to do first and what you could

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.990
potentially leave off to the end,
right?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.230
Now I would say, you know, first, second,
and third priority items,

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.020
none of those get dropped to
the end or left off entirely.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.180
But it's just a great
exercise to go through.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.950
This is not a big academic thing.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.280
It's just take the time,
get the right people in the room,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.740
talk about these things,
and let these things start

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.470
to drive your product design.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.040
So, understand your users,
understand the market,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.390
determine the attributes you want
to go after with your product,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.360
prioritize those things.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.060
The next thing is understand yourself.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.450
Figure out what your strengths
are and what your weaknesses are.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.510
Who can you partner with?

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.790
Determine who you can partner
with to leverage their strengths.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.160
You take the guys at
Delicious Monster with Delicious Library.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.000
They decided that their
expertise was one thing,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.670
and that if they wanted to
get information about books

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.150
and DVDs and CDs or whatever,
that they would go out

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.240
and partner with Amazon.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.900
Perfect partnership.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.360
What do you do?

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.780
What does your product do that really,
at the end of the day,

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.690
is not your strength?

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.500
Find those areas and
get rid of that code.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.480
Partner with somebody else
who does it real well.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.660
At the end of the day,
you'll have a partnership of innovators,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.170
or a partnership of, you know,
kind of like the Apple Intel thing.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.690
Get the right people
together on the project,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.760
and you're going to have a
better product as a result.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.640
Another thing to do is
look at other successful

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.920
applications or the competition.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.720
What are they doing right?

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.280
What are they not doing right?

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.620
What can you take advantage of
in terms of their weaknesses?

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.200
And if they're doing something right,
why are they doing that right?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.870
What do they know that you don't know?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.290
All of this analysis,
this doesn't take years.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.260
This is-- you know,
you can do this quickly.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.850
But a lot of companies I meet with,
when I ask these basic questions, I say,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.560
who are your competition?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.060
Oh, they state the competition.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.820
I say, well, so what are their strengths?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.820
Well, what are you guys good at?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.880
Write some Cocoa code, or whatever.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.720
So I'm going to joke around,
but I've seen a lot of companies

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.000
I've been with do great stuff.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.540
But I like kidding
around in this session.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.520
All right, so you've done all that stuff.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.690
Now the question is, all right,
start to define the solution.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.020
You've all got great ideas.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.060
I don't think I've met with a single
company over the last five and a half

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.660
years that didn't have a good idea.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.050
Maybe one.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.920
But when you start to define,
you've got a great idea.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.040
You're very, very-- there's lots of
great ideas out there.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.820
Now the challenge is, all right,
so what is this idea?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.760
How is it going to become a product?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.720
What is it really going to do?

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.140
What are the problems it's
really going to solve?

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.470
And then a really great exercise
is to work cross-functionally

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.880
as a team and define a mission
statement for your product.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.860
I put it here as a product
definition statement.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.580
But a mission statement for your product.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.220
And then hang it up.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.850
Print it out.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.500
Hang it up amongst the design team.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.480
And everything you do should come
back to that mission statement.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.460
Every feature you consider,
every aspect of the product

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.500
should be run through the filter
of that mission statement to say,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.040
hey, hey, hey,
is this really part of this product?

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.520
Is this really what we meant it to be?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.740
Does this need to be here?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.440
The tendency is, as you guys know,
I'm sure,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.030
the tendency is to fall victim to the
need to kind of glom on another feature,

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.000
like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.450
Hey, somebody wanted this thing,
let's put this new feature on.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.780
And it kind of gets glommed on.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.660
And at first, you don't notice it.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.040
But after you develop a product,
a couple revisions,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.700
and you've done it that way,
suddenly you think, man,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.680
we're getting-- it's
kind of out of control.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.380
Or it's just not what we thought
it was going to be originally.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.540
And so this is a great way
to keep yourself in line.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.050
Keep in mind things like usability,
efficiency, the desired workflow.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.520
How are your customers going
to work with this thing?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.600
And what other applications
does the product interact with?

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.660
Do you need drag and drop
interaction with-- Final Cut Pro?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.060
Or do you need cut, copy, paste?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.100
Or how does data move from your
product to the other products?

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.090
And if it doesn't,
then maybe you can drop the need

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.050
for some of that functionality.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.490
So anyway, lots of stuff to do.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.900
Last thing is keep things simple.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.140
We're going to go through
this stuff in detail.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.060
But keep things simple.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.100
Boil down the large
concepts to their essence,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.720
to small, discrete functionality.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.500
The tendency is to say, hey,
we've got this great idea.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.630
And then suddenly-- actually,
there's a great-- let me just

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.840
illustrate this with a cartoon.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.020
I saw it one time years ago.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.620
And it was this comic strip.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.380
And there were a bunch of guys,
people sitting at computers.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.240
And they're ready to code.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.850
And the boss is going out the door.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.060
And he says, you guys get coding.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.780
I'll go upstairs and see
what they want us to make.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.040
And too often, that's the case.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.820
So get these ideas down.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.100
Figure out who your customer base is.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.020
Figure out who your market segment is.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.140
And then define a mission
statement and go from there.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.140
And anyway, so at that point,
you've got a good idea.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.290
You understand all those things.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.370
You've got a sense for what the
product is very specifically.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.000
Now you start to figure out, well,
what's your feature set?

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.200
How will the product work specifically?

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.120
If you're a time billing product
or you're a music player,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.400
well,
what functionality do you want to have?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.280
And that's where we start
to bring in the features.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.160
Define the core set of features required,
but avoid feature cascade.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.060
Don't just glom on things and
look at the competition and say,

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.790
oh, we have to do everything they do.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.620
When it comes down to it,
some of the best products

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.670
today on MacÂ OSÂ X,
for that matter, some of the best

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.560
products in the industry,
most usable products in the industry,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.490
are not the most full-featured
products in the world.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.080
You take the iPod.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.450
Why is the iPod successful?

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.680
Yes, it's got great marketing behind it.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.800
Yes,
it's got a great music store behind it.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.580
But at the end of the day,
the iPod is what it is because it does

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.240
exactly what everyone wants it to do.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.100
Is it the most full-featured
music player in the world?

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.560
Does it have the most wheels
and dials and buttons?

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.180
No, but it doesn't matter.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.740
No one cares because they want
this music player to do just what

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.960
it does and it does it perfectly.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.070
Is iTunes the most full-featured
music jukebox software in the world?

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:49.820
Not at all.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.530
There's lots of other products
out there that have way more

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.990
bells and whistles on them.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:16:02.700
[Transcript missing]

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:55.300
[Transcript missing]

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:18.700
[Transcript missing]

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.930
For new users,
it wasn't intuitive enough.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.570
We found that people that were
new to the product were spending

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.140
too much time looking for the
common commands they needed.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.500
They were spending too much
time trying to find things.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.150
They were getting lost
in the user interface.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.850
They were having trouble finding things.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.770
So that needed to be solved.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.770
And finally,
our user interface was showing its age.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.320
You know, we shipped our version one
of our product in 1998.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.950
And the user interface that we
designed at that time was appropriate

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.730
for the user interface of that time.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.570
Well, things have changed
dramatically since then.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.420
I mean, the user interface of MacÂ OSÂ X,
for example,

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.320
is dramatically different from the
user interface of classic MacÂ OS.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.800
So we needed to bring our user interface,
you know, to the market.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.310
you know, into the modern age.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.770
So this is our previous version,
Real Basic 5.5.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.800
And it's got a lot of windows and
we carbonized it and we made it,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.450
gave it the Aqua user interface.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.980
But the thing is,
is the Aqua user interface isn't the same

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.400
thing as the MacÂ OSÂ X user experience.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.020
Those aren't the same thing at all.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.140
Aqua is just a component of that.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.700
So it's not enough to simply
give it the Aqua interface.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.350
You've got to think about what is
the user expecting on MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.460
And this is not what they're expecting.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.420
So we decided that this needed a
change and needed a dramatic change.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.630
So this is what we came up with.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.840
This is the version that we're going
to be shipping later this month.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.290
It's a single document window.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.310
It has a toolbar,
which we didn't have before.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.250
Actually, it has a couple of toolbars.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.480
And it just, you know,
it also accomplishes the most,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.870
the oldest feature in our database,
which was the ability for the user

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.100
to have multiple projects open.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.270
And it's a little bit more
complicated than the previous version.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.590
So we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.440
And it's a little bit more
complicated than the previous version.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.070
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.960
than the previous version.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.120
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.740
than the previous version.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.440
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:24.730
than the previous version.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.330
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:25.670
than the previous version.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.310
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.640
than the previous version.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.260
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.560
than the previous version.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.180
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:28.480
than the previous version.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.090
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.360
than the previous version.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.960
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.270
than the previous version.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:30.840
And we decided to make it a
little bit more complicated

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.090
than They navigate a lot.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.480
And so we asked ourselves, well,
what knowledge does the

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.600
user have of navigation?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.360
What do they already
know about navigation?

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.680
Well, they navigate the file
system from the finder,

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.330
and they navigate with a web browser.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.910
So we decided to take that
knowledge that they already have,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.970
those skills they already have,
and use those with our

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.220
new user interface.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.440
So you can see that the
new user interface looks

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.990
somewhat like a web browser.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.000
There's forward and back buttons.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.940
There's a location field in the
middle where you can type in the

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.420
name of something in your project,
and bang, it takes you right to it.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.960
There's a search field in
the upper right corner,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.690
right where it is in a web browser.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.920
And we've got tabbed browsing as well.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.520
There's tabs right in the middle,
so the user can see everything

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.100
that they're working with.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.580
And so when someone who is coming
to Real Basic for the first time,

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.360
if they've used the finder,
if they've used a web browser,

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.370
they're going to look at this interface,
and they're going to see

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.700
things that are familiar.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.450
And they're going to say, hey,
I bet you that search field works similar

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.520
to a search field in a web browser.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.360
I bet you those tabs work
just like the tabs in Safari,

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.280
that kind of thing.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.460
So in our previous version,
too many windows, way too many windows.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.620
And this isn't even close to what
a typical user actually deals with.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.080
I've only opened a few of them here.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.110
And what happens here is,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.550
the experienced user winds
up rearranging these windows

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.660
constantly and resizing them.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.730
And the new user,
windows get in front of other windows.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.920
I was watching a user use
this version of our product,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.980
and the project window,
which is the little window

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.000
in the upper left corner,
it got lost completely.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
It was like, well, wait a minute,
what happened to my project window?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.800
I can't find it anymore.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.000
And they're moving windows
around to try to find it.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.000
So way too many windows.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So we solved that problem
with a tabbed interface.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.480
Since we have a single document window,
a single window document

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.900
model this time around,
we added tabs.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.500
And now the user can't get lost
because everything that they've

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.060
got open appears as a tab,
and it's all right in front of them,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.000
easy to find, easy to use.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:43.080
The other problem we had is, you know,
we had concepts that we

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.040
displayed in multiple windows.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.660
For example,
we have a view editor or window editor,

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.010
and when you double-click on an item
to look at the code behind that item,

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.480
we open another window.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.770
And as you can imagine,
this just leads to more and more windows.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.300
It's more confusing.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.500
So we changed the concept here.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.140
The user can still double-click
on an item to get to their code,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.870
but rather than open another tab,
we stay within one tab because

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.640
a tab represents an item.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.560
And the user can use a little
widget in the upper left corner

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.280
to switch between the view of the
layout of the window and the code.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.960
So important commands in
Real Basic that were in the

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.320
previous version hidden on menus,
running your application,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.760
building your application,
those are pretty important.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.850
What we did with those is we
moved them right into the toolbar

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.160
where they're easy to get to.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.480
The user doesn't have to move their
mouse all the way up to a menu

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.790
or remember a keyboard shortcut.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.550
I'm a mouse person myself.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.560
Some of you may be keyboard people.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.360
But we built the interface
for both types of users.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.610
And so these commands are right up front,
easy to find.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.360
The new user can find them right away.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.260
The experienced user isn't
spending a lot of time mousing

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.390
around trying to run or build.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.680
Some other common commands,
things like adding a new

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.000
window to your project,
adding a class interface or a module.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.630
These kind of things previously
were hidden on a menu.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.630
Now,

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:30.350
So, we created this toolbar under
each tab for the common commands.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.210
And so, for the new user, once again,
they're right in front of them,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:33.950
easy to find.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.980
For the experienced user, they're,
you know,

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.430
right where they want them to be.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.370
And the other thing about this
interface that's different from

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.780
our previous user interface is
that our previous user interface

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.890
was really not customizable at all.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.900
You pretty much had to use
it exactly the way it comes.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.560
And, of course, that's changed.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.150
User interfaces are much
more customizable these days.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.200
I mean, look at the finder, for example.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.800
And so,
what we did with this user interface

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.140
is made it customizable as well.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.630
So, you can add your own
commands to the toolbars.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.660
You can change the way the toolbars look.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.670
You can use small icons, labels only,
that sort of thing.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.920
Thank you.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.540
Another common command,
a lot of common commands

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.600
are in dialog boxes.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.770
Searching is something that
users of Real Basic do a lot.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.140
Searching clearly is something
that Apple feels people do a

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:25.130
lot in all their applications,
in Mail, in Spotlight now, in Tiger,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.560
that kind of thing.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.460
So having this hidden away in a
dialog doesn't really make sense,

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.700
so we've moved it in the
interface right up to the toolbar.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.050
And again,
it's right where people expect it to be.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.490
We're reusing that knowledge that
people already have of other products.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.010
Now we still have a find
dialog in Real Basic 2005,

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.340
but it's for doing the advanced
sort of finds that the expert

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.650
user is going to do occasionally.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.930
You know,
earlier John alluded to the idea of,

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.010
you know, you have novice users,
you might have novice users,

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.730
you might have advanced users.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.680
Expert users, well,
with a product like Real Basic,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.470
we have both.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.260
We have people that are
professional programmers that

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.150
have been writing code for years,
and we have people that are novice

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.590
users that have never written
a line of code in their lives.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.070
We have professional developers,
and we have, you know,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.970
10-year-old kids learning programming.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.210
So we have to have an interface that
works for that very diverse group.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.310
We also made improvements
with our previous version of

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.640
Real Basic when you used the find
dialog and it found something,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.780
it would open the window for that
item and show you what it found.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.240
Well, imagine in this case we found,
what, 156 items.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.310
Okay, if you kept doing find, find, find,
find, find,

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.940
you'd end up with 156 windows open,
which is really crazy.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.350
So, when we rebuilt our interface,
when we redesigned it,

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.950
we didn't just say,
let's just rebuild all the

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.810
functionality over again.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.600
We looked at each function to say how,
if we could,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.250
since we're going to do this over again,
how could we do it better?

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.630
So, we, in this case, when you do a find,
you get a batch list of the results,

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.110
you can see everything,
they're categorized by type,

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.950
and the user can even highlight items
and do a replace in this dialog as well.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:19.100
We have a tips window in Real Basic,
and it's for context-sensitive help.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.600
And it's really great.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.880
Our customers love it.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.710
It's pretty innovative in that
our tips window actually watches

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.160
what you're doing and only offers
advice when it's appropriate.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.040
It doesn't just bring up the random
tip of the day that people ignore.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.980
It's actually watching
the behavior of the user.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:40.410
And once the user learns the behavior,
it stops presenting that tip.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.360
And if you go back,
maybe you've forgotten a

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.540
certain way of doing things,
it'll notice, hey,

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.360
they've forgotten the behavior,
so let's teach it to them again,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.880
and the tips window will
give you that information.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.150
Well, the problem is,
as much as our customers

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.610
love the tips window,
because they're constantly

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.850
moving their windows around,
rearranging them, etc., well,

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.160
the tips window is also
getting in the way.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.730
They're constantly
having to move it around.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.860
So they had kind of a love-hate
relationship with this.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.480
So what we did for 2005 is we moved
it to the bottom of the main window.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.040
It's in, like, the equivalent of the
status bar in Safari.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.300
So it's always there.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.070
It's always in the same place.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.960
Nice, consistent interface.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.050
And it never gets in their way.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.120
In our previous version,
we had too many modal dialogs.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.190
Sheets are a great improvement over
the modal dialogs we had in some cases.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.580
Like in this case,
the dialog you're looking at is

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.300
the method declaration dialog.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.550
Well,
the user needs to interact with this

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.700
information and the code behind it,
but in this case,

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.100
it's covering up about half the code.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.190
The user can't see both at the same time.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.300
So we changed that in Real Basic 2005
to make it less modal.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.410
That information is now a
pane inside the code editor,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.300
which can be expanded or collapsed.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.300
So the user can work with it,
work with their code,

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.290
collapse it quickly,
and they're not in a modal state anymore.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.750
In fact,
I think we probably only have one or two

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:10.180
modal dialogs in all of Real Basic 2005,
and they're the kinds of things that the

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.270
user is going to rarely interact with.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.120
So what did we learn going
through this process?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:23.300
Well, first we learned that we
need to watch our users.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.840
You need to watch what
your users are doing.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.930
John said this earlier.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.060
Watch how they work.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.260
You don't need a $10,000
or $100,000 lab to do this.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.490
You don't need two-way mirrors and
video cameras and all the scientific

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.080
way of monitoring what a person does.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.640
Bring them into your conference
room and just sit next to them

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.300
and watch them use your product.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.640
You will see when they get
frustrated or when they're confused.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.940
And we did this ourselves.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.720
We brought users into
our conference room.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.140
We sat there and watched them work.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.660
New users and experienced users.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.750
And we were surprised at
the things we learned.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.160
I guarantee you, if you do this,
you better have a pad of paper or

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.020
you better be the world's fastest
typist because you're not going to

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.320
be able to take notes fast enough.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.560
You're going to actually ask people,
could you stop for a second because I'm

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.210
not able to write all this stuff down.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.920
You're going to learn a tremendous
amount about your product,

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.260
about your user interface.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.190
Don't be afraid to make big changes.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.540
You know, as developers,
we pour our blood, sweat,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.380
and tears into building our products.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:35.600
And we love the way we do things,
and we've poured a lot of energy into it.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.400
But that's not really what's important.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.620
I mean, it's great to do that.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.470
But at the end of the day,
what's important is that

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.030
the product be usable.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.340
I mean, we're not doing this out of
the kindness of our hearts.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.590
We want to make money.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.460
So the more usable your product is,
the more intuitive it is,

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.080
the more of it you're going to sell.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.320
So that's really important.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.820
And in our case,
there was really no way for us

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.100
to make incremental changes to
arrive at what we needed to have,

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.120
this new user interface.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.950
We really had to make a dramatic change.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.990
And we accepted that.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.190
We spent two years doing it.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.820
And in fact, as a side note,
the previous version's user

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.510
interface was written in C++ on top
of our cross-platform framework.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.560
This version, Real Basic 2005,
is written in Real Basic.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.040
So when people ask us, well,
give me an example of what

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.620
you can do with Real Basic,
now we can say, well, Real Basic.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.690
So don't be afraid to make big changes.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.150
Consider the knowledge
the user already has.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.470
I mentioned this earlier.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:39.700
It's not always the best thing to do.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.080
It may be creative,
but it's not always the best thing to do

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.960
to invent some new way of doing things.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.060
Sometimes it's good to innovate,
but other times it's

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.580
good to be consistent.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.940
And consistency really should come first.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.100
If there is no consistent
way of doing something,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.840
well then you're going to have
to come up with something new.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.460
But if there is a way that
the user is used to working,

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.620
then do that.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.010
I mean,
imagine if you got into an automobile

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.180
and the steering wheel was different and
the way you shifted gears was different

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.040
and the way you turned on blinkers.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.290
I mean, you can get into any car and
immediately use it because you're

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.240
reusing knowledge you have,
right?

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.200
It would be very frustrating
if it didn't work that way.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.270
Well, software is exactly the same way.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.360
And I think that Apple has got
to be the kings of consistency

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.800
and excellent user interface.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.570
So, look at what knowledge the user
has and reuse that knowledge.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.390
Read Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.460
The guidelines aren't just
examples of what to do.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.040
They don't necessarily say this,
but there was a tremendous amount of

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:49.580
thought and care and logic that went
into the user interface guidelines.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.370
That logic may not be presented
in the document itself,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.180
but trust me, it's all behind the scenes.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.370
Read the Human Interface Guidelines.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.340
Know them well.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.050
You'll learn a lot from that.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.500
and visit the H.I.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.590
Lab.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:07.500
John mentioned this earlier.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.560
It's down the hall.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.660
You can sit down with user
interface experts at Apple.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.500
They'll give you plenty
of great feedback.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:20.450
A couple times during the
development of our user interface,

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.500
we sat down with John Geleynsse,
which we really appreciate, John.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.350
He went over the entire user interface
with us and gave us a tremendous

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.500
amount of feedback on big things,
on little things.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.500
There was a lot of stuff that we would
have missed if we hadn't done that.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.620
As developers,
Apple provides this to you,

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.340
so take advantage of it.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.500
John said not everyone is
an expert at everything.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.390
That's absolutely true.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.410
You're not necessarily going to be an
expert at user interface right away.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.490
The people at Apple are.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.500
Take advantage of that resource.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.290
So I'd like to thank you
for having me here today,

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.140
John,
and enjoy the rest of the conference.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.000
All right, that's great.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.060
I'd like to invite one
other guy on stage.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.230
Adam Baker is an intern
for me a couple years ago.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.450
He's going to talk quickly about
what they did with their product,

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.840
and then we're going to get into
some cutting-edge bleeding stuff.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.200
Thank you, John.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.700
So, as John mentioned,
I am a user interface

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.640
designer for Market Circle,
and we just released a

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.660
product called Billings,
which as you may be able to tell from

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.670
the icon is a time billing application.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.560
So you can track your time,
send invoices, track payments, and so on.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.940
So this is Billings' main window,
and it's not especially

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.100
exciting software because it's
basically accounting software.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:54.100
You know,
this is not really glamorous stuff.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.400
Nevertheless,
somewhat mundane or boring software

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.100
can still be well designed.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.050
And we think that Billings works.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.050
Now the question is
how does Billings work,

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.100
or why does it work?

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.520
And when we looked at the competition,
we found that they were

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.100
just too complicated.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.100
So our goal was to keep Billings simple.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.880
Now this is also kind of misleading
because keeping something

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:17.100
simple is harder than it looks.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.100
It's really about focus.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.060
So, focus is really about saying
no to things that don't belong,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.460
rather than finding the right
thing and saying yes to that.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.040
It's about saying this doesn't belong.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.240
One way to frame your
application to focus it is to

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.520
ask a few questions about it.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.250
The first is who's going to use it?

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.180
John and Jeff talked about this already.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:39.180
This is the most important step.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.840
Then find out what will it be.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.930
This is really talking
about the functionality,

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:46.330
what the application will
do for these customers.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.440
And next is how will it work?

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.530
And this really is about the actual
user interface of the product.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.590
So in the case of Billings,
the first thing we had to find out

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:56.860
was who's going to use this product.

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:59.500
We had to identify our users.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.120
And one thing that we knew
about our users is that they're

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.600
independent professionals who
track and build their time.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.560
So these are people like lawyers,
like designers, like housing contractors.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:09.700
They do work.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.540
They work at a particular hourly wage.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.180
They need to send accurate
invoices to their customers.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.070
We know that they spend most of
their time in other applications

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.600
or not on the Mac at all.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.600
Which means that in
the case of a designer,

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.710
for instance,
she might spend 8 hours a day,

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.750
or 7 hours a day,
or 12 hours a day in QuarkXPress,

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.600
in Photoshop, in InDesign.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.270
You know,
Billings is going to be a secondary app,

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.150
even though it's doing
something very important.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.820
Our users aren't accountants,
so they may not be familiar

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.660
with accounting terms,
they may not like keeping

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.200
track of expense receipts,
and making up invoices,

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.300
and calculating taxes,
and markup and discount.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.800
This is not fun stuff.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.300
Some people aren't very good at math.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.300
Programs should do this for them.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:57.260
Understanding the users leads
to this concept of a solution.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.560
Going point by point,
our users need a solution that

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.200
makes time tracking simple.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.310
It needs to be easy.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.170
They need something that's
easy to learn and lightweight.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.970
In the case of the designer,
remember that our

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.650
application is secondary.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.620
If it takes up a lot of
screen real estate or if it's

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.400
very imposing on the user,
they're going to find that it gets

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.800
in the way of their normal workflow.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.100
So in our case, we do have a main window,
a big window,

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.100
but the core functionality is
provided in a smaller window,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.400
a timer window,
that floats above all other

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.200
applications or can be hidden
completely and still run.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.200
And the most important thing, perhaps,
in a case like this,

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.200
really has very little to do
with user interface per se,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.500
but everything to do
with user experience,

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.100
which is that the solution
that we came up with had to do

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.400
the heavy lifting for users.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.100
So users aren't doing the
accounting themselves.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.810
Billings is doing the
accounting for them.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.060
Second question, what will Billings do,
is all about defining the functionality.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.940
So a very common way of
developing is to come up with

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.520
a list of features like this.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.320
So an application like Billings needs
to do all of this stuff and more.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:10.130
But it's almost impossible
to look at this and distill a

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.420
really compact statement that
describes what the solution is.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.160
Yet you could begin with this
and actually implement all of

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.770
these features one at a time.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.110
You could string them together
into some kind of user interface.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.840
Best thing to do,
as John already mentioned,

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.800
is to come up with a mission statement.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.210
In our case, all of these features can
be condensed into estimates,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.600
time tracking, and invoicing for the
Mac-based professional.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:35.870
This is our solution.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:36.860
This is like a box.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.140
We know what stuff goes in the box.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.920
We know things that
don't belong in the box.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.710
The last part, how will Billings work?

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.330
This is really about the
user interface design,

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.340
and so I'm not going to go into
detail about what we did per se,

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.640
but I'll share with you some tips.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.640
If you want to see what we ended up with,
you can download Billings.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.340
So I figured that there are
three big tips I can share with

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.870
you that came out of what we
learned when we're doing Billings.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.110
The first is to think Aqua.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.240
As Jeff mentioned,
Aqua and the whole MacÂ OSÂ X user

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.640
experience is something
that is very complete.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.510
It's got a very specific feel.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.400
And a lot of work has been done by
other developers and by Apple to come

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.640
up with the human interface guidelines,
great examples of applications.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.350
So thinking Aqua is really important.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.470
If your app doesn't look and
feel like a MacÂ OSÂ X application,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.990
users will reject it right away.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.700
Second tip is to design on paper.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.900
And the third tip is to keep
learning proportional to your

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.540
application's importance.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.340
This is also really, really important.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.950
If your application is like Billings,
one that people use

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.100
maybe 10 minutes a day,
you don't want to make

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.060
it difficult to learn.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.660
People need to be able to get
in and out really quickly.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.510
But, you know,
there's a big focus on ease of use and

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.700
you might feel that if your application
is one that people use all day,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.200
that it's the main
part of their business,

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.710
that you don't,
it might be confusing to you to

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.300
say it needs to be easy to use.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.100
You know, this is a complicated app,
it does all of these complicated things

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.780
and it's really helpful to our users.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.140
In that case,
people will be willing to learn

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.260
more about your application because
it's their bread and butter.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.280
But in the case of something like
a calculator or time tracking app,

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.300
you know, it has to be obvious
right from the start.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.540
So the first point about Aqua,
I mean these are just some

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.600
screens from Billings.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.520
In the vein of keeping it easy to learn,
we had to make sure that every dialogue,

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.340
every window was easily digestible.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.480
So one thing that the Aqua guidelines
talk about that good MacÂ OSÂ X apps do

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.620
is they take advantage of white space.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.600
They intelligently group controls.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.510
No matter what kind of
dialogue you're doing,

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:44.000
you can keep things easily
understandable by leaving a lot of space.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.050
Don't crowd anything.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.690
Use standard controls and so on.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.360
This point about starting on
paper is really important to me.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.400
This is a scan of a sketchbook page.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.080
And there's this line,
the pen is mightier than the mouse.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.720
Yeah, it's very cheesy, so my apologies.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.880
But it's really important.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.440
When you are planning your application,
it's great that, you know, for instance,

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.070
IB is so fast.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.600
You can drag out your controls,
you can start thinking about

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.020
your bindings right away.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.260
You can think about making an app almost,
you know, instantly.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.750
But what you're not doing is you're
not thinking twice or three times

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.580
as you're pulling out your app.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.050
You're not pulling out these controls.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.830
You know,
I can lay out a dialogue like some of

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.880
the ones I showed you in five minutes,
maybe less.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.220
But to actually draw it on paper
takes quite a bit more time.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.210
And as I'm committing
my pen to the paper,

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.520
drawing each button,
or drawing each window,

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.700
as the case may be,
depending on how detailed

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.570
you are with your sketches,
you're thinking twice.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:44.820
It's really hard to draw and write
out eight radio buttons on paper.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.940
And as you're writing those
eight radio buttons out,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.680
you'll be thinking, do I need this one?

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.030
Maybe not.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.580
You know, maybe I can skip this
one and get by faster.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.600
Maybe this one doesn't really make sense.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.740
So starting on paper is a really
great way to plan your app.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.530
And the most important thing about this,
really,

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.450
is that you can make mistakes now,
and you don't have to recode anything.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.220
You can just make mistakes
and show it to someone,

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.090
say, does this work?

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.900
No, no, you've got to move this around.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.800
You haven't actually invested in code.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.340
You haven't invested in nibs.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.000
You can just change it on paper.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.590
And once you have it planned, go digital.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.450
And so the point about
keeping learning minimal,

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.910
if there's anything extra in your UI,
it means that people have

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:23.940
to learn something extra.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.050
So focus on your core functionality.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.420
Anything extra, get rid of it,
because people are just going to

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.760
have to learn what that thing does,
and it's away from the

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.800
main purpose of the app.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:35.220
It's not focused.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.790
Progressive disclosure makes it
easy for users to get started.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.340
So like Jeff was just saying,
put certain things right up front,

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.430
but keep other things that maybe
are fringe case or for the 20% of

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.340
users available but hidden away.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.010
We'll show these things later as people
become more comfortable with the app.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.840
and use context-sensitive help.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.900
Also,
Jeff showed that they have the tip window

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.620
or the tip status bar in Real Basic 2005.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.120
We do something kind
of similar in Billings,

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.330
which is we have a help box.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:08.350
When you first open the application,
certain areas of the interface are

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.480
described for you in an unobtrusive
box that will go away the next

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.840
time you use the application,
unless you want it.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.820
What it does is it says,
"This is what this is for.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:18.310
This is it.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.210
Now you know what it does.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.700
Now you don't have to
go get help anywhere.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.700
Now you don't have to try to
figure out what this button does.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.000
It's already explained for you.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:30.290
So again, keeping it simple,
like we did with Billings.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.650
Focus on your users.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:37.300
Focus on a solution to your users' needs,
not a list of features.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.290
And focus on a clean and
well-planned Aqua UI.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:41.960
Planning is everything.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.000
Get it done on paper first,
make sure that you're happy with it,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.900
that your users are going
to be happy with it,

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:47.940
and then move digital.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:52.000
So I'd like to thank
John for having me up today.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.900
All right, that's part one.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:42:59.610
We've got to move fast.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.880
Determining your features.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.600
Once you've got all that
stuff taken care of,

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.320
the next question, of course,
is which technologies

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.130
do I use in MacÂ OSÂ X,
and how do I prioritize them?

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.640
And I'm going to bring
back something here,

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.070
which I did years ago,
and I still today get

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.820
requests for this chart.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.680
And this is a modern version,
a new 2005 version of the chart,

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.330
and hopefully it's a lot more
accurate than the one I did before.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.300
But as you look at Aqua and over the
overall MacÂ OSÂ X user experience,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.630
you've got your thing figured out,
you know what features

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:29.640
you want to put in.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.840
Now it's like, well, okay,
there's all this stuff in MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.610
How do I decide,
do I go for address book, or do I go for,

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.460
you know, font picker, or do I put,
you know, standard controls?

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.740
What about drag install?

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.190
You know,
how do you prioritize all that stuff?

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.400
And I want to show you how to
prioritize it with this chart,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.480
which is basically three screens.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.440
The first screen is what
I call the bare minimum.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.600
If you're bringing a
product to the platform,

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.150
this is the bare minimum.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.900
In other words, this is the fee you pay
to get into the club.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.400
And if you're not doing these things,
you're not going to win

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.450
the Apple Design Awards.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.780
I'm going to be all over you,
and to me it's like, well,

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.300
then you're not,
you don't have a finished product.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.660
And I'll be pretty brutal about that.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.980
Use reserved keyboard shortcuts.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.300
We have a single menu bar in MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.780
You know,
the nothing up in the menu bar with

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.270
menus in the window thing doesn't cut it.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.160
MDI, like the old,
the thing where you've got a

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.440
parent window and you've got all
the child windows constrained.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.620
So,
I'm going to be pretty brutal about that.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.170
Use reserved keyboard shortcuts.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.710
We have a single menu bar in MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.520
You know,
the nothing up in the menu bar with

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.370
menus in the window thing doesn't cut it.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.320
MDI, like the old,
the thing where you've got a

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:37.470
parent window and you've got all
the child windows constrained.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.900
Nothing more annoying than
having to hide the docs so

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.060
you can get that window again,
right?

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.500
Multi-window environment.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.080
There's all kinds of stuff about how
windows are interleaved on MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.800
You should respect that
and do the right thing.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.520
Use the proper APIs for that.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.340
Put files in the proper places.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.040
Don't throw turds all over my system,
right?

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.920
Put preferences in preferences.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:02.770
Put user double-clickable documents
in my home directory documents folder,

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:03.720
et cetera.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.590
Use standard AQA controls.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.200
Support the clipboard.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.300
At the very minimum,
every application should do

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.510
these things and support cut,
copy, paste.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:46:40.000
[Transcript missing]

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:41.970
So that's what users expect.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.760
So we've already talked about 15 things,
I think.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.260
Well, what else is there?

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:49.730
Well, you know what?

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.720
Just because you do the bare
minimum and what users expect,

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.720
if you do that,
you'll have a great app on MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.360
But you know what?

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.210
At the end of the day,
the best products on the

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.070
platform do a whole lot more.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:03.020
And they do a whole lot more
because it differentiates them.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.680
And I want to encourage you,
in terms of user experience,

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.480
that it's all about surprise and delight.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.610
So do the bare minimum.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.340
Also do what users expect.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.560
And then go above and beyond.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.790
Things like adopting sheets and
drawers from for less modality,

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:22.880
more mode-lessness, or inserted panes,
the way Real Basic was doing it.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.340
Do things like Doc Icon badging.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.160
Integrate Spotlight.

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:31.700
Spotlight plugins are great
because I can find the documents

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.320
I created with your product.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.000
But think about integrating Spotlight
in terms of smart playlists.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.470
What if your product had
the ability to do backups,

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.780
let's say,
and instead of forcing the user

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:45.020
to back up the hard drive based
on the physical location of a

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.580
folder or a file on the hard drive?

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:51.150
Let the user do some kind of a
Spotlight smart backup folder thing

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.480
so it goes and gets all my pictures.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.140
From a user's point of view,
all they want to do is

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.740
back up their pictures.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.450
Your product knows what
all my pictures means.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.200
And it goes out, calls Spotlight,
does an MD query, gets all this stuff,

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.900
throws it into a container, and boom,
backs this thing up without me, the user,

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.640
having to worry about where the
physical location of all my pictures is.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:14.180
So integrate Spotlight in terms of
smart folders and that sort of thing.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:16.560
Internationalize for all the
customers around the world.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.610
Add accessibility and voiceover if
the market segment you're aiming at,

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.880
which is education or for government,
it's a priority.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.960
It is a criteria for purchase for them.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.800
Integrate where appropriate.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:34.820
Great medical imaging product
called Osiris integrates with iPod,

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.400
integrates with .Mac,
integrates with all of the right things

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.680
to enable doctors to collaborate.

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.950
If there's something your app can
do above and beyond what users

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.540
expect in terms of integrating
with other applications.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.800
If there's something you can do above
and beyond what users expect in terms

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.540
of integrating with other applications,
you should be doing that.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.880
So that you address their needs and
really surprise and delight them.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.340
And then of course there's the whole
visual rendering of stuff on screen.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:59.600
So prioritize your stuff.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.500
Make sure you've got the bare minimum,
then do the rest,

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.540
and then go off and surprise and delight.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.090
All right.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.460
Let's get into the real
meat of this stuff.

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.220
So design your user experience.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.000
Design the interface for your product.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.380
This is all about
applying good techniques.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.040
The first thing which is
really critical-- excuse me--

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.370
is to take-- you understand
who users are now.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.030
The question is to ask, all right,
well what are they thinking about

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.360
when they're approaching this task?

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.140
What are they thinking about when
they're starting to use this product?

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.520
What are the concepts and
workflows and hierarchies of

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.200
objects and all of the things?

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.040
What are the terms they're using,
and et cetera?

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.980
Get a handle on these things
because your main window,

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.420
your main UI,
the organization of your menus,

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:46.900
the names of your utility windows,
your palette windows,

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:52.780
everything that you do should be modeled,
should reflect that mental model.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:57.710
If I'm doing music jukebox stuff,
if I'm designing a jukebox player,

00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:01.140
like iTunes, if you ask somebody what
should that product have,

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.440
or what are the ideas
and concepts you've got,

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.640
workflows,
they're going to talk about playing,

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.060
controls for playing the thing.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.640
They're going to talk about collections,
predominant,

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.320
well-positioned in the main UI.

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.410
They're going to talk about the
actual tracks that they play,

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.300
very, very dominate.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.310
It dominates the UI of iTunes.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.060
The main object users are
thinking about is music tracks,

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.820
and it's there in the interface.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:25.550
And lastly,
some users might bring up the idea

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:26.820
that they have to search for stuff.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.090
And so that's in the main UI interface.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.240
But notice,
there's four components to iTunes.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:38.730
And that models the hierarchy and the
objects and the mental model that users

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:39.970
have when they approach this product.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.560
Here's another example, iCal.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.340
Think about iCal.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.260
It's a calendaring tool.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.730
Well, you need to have the ability
to have multiple calendars.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.640
So that's featured very
clearly in the interface.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.480
You need to have the
actual calendar itself.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.540
Well, that dominates the interface.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.680
And then you have other things
like changing the month.

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.000
And then simple controls.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.070
The most primary, most important,
most frequently accessed

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:02.990
controls are in the UI.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:03.900
That's it.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.520
That's it.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.500
All right, what else?

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.700
Another example.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:09.940
Connoisseur.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.240
Great recipe management tool.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.960
You think about recipe
management on the computer,

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.140
it's been the holy grail of
software since computers started.

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.520
Everybody's writing about how
computers are great for recipes.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.910
Well, it seems like it's taken forever
for somebody to come up with this,

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.050
and this product I think
comes really close.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:29.410
They've got a great module for displaying
the recipe instructions in huge text,

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.740
so you can have your power book
down on the countertop and you can

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.820
be doing stuff and just look over.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.450
You're not looking at
tiny text like this.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.300
But this is their navigation window,
and they've got the ability to organize

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.950
all of their content in these playlists.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.840
They've taken the iTunes
and iPhoto playlist model.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.150
And then when you think about recipes,
well, you've got cuisine and the type

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.360
of courses and the ingredients
and the actual recipes themselves,

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.860
and that dominates the UI.

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.340
That's it.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.500
They could have approached
this in a very different way,

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.250
but they went about it this way,
and it really works for the product.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.050
SoftRaid.

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.570
Software RAID solution.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.010
When you're talking about RAID,
you're talking about

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.340
physical hard drives.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.500
With hard drives with
wires and power supplies,

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.460
and then on those hard drives you've
got logical volumes for the file system.

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:14.500
Well, this is so dominant in the UI.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.430
It drives the point home.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.140
Hard drives there,
connected to the disk menu.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.120
Left to right hierarchy of menus.

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.440
So the first thing is the disk,
the physical device.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.420
On that physical device I've got volumes.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.270
So those are represented
in the UI very clearly.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.080
And there's no misunderstanding by
the user which logical volumes are

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.310
connected to which physical drives.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.440
The UI does a great job
of understanding that.

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:40.160
The UI does a great job of driving,
of supporting the user's mental model.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.640
And you need to be doing this.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.970
Every time I meet with a
company to do a UI review,

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:46.500
I talk about what's the
user's mental model?

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.500
How are you reflecting
that in your product?

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.450
And it's amazing.

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:50.880
We kind of do this churn,
and people think about it,

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:52.950
and they don't know
what I'm talking about,

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.680
and I explain it, we go through it,
and eventually a light

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.530
bulb goes on and they go,
"Oh." And then suddenly when you get it,

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:04.500
you realize your menus are disorganized,
the whole thing just falls into place.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.430
How many times have you looked
at your product and wondered,

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.420
"Where do we stick this feature?

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.320
Which menu does it go in?" You know,
and if that's ever occurred to you,

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.500
you've got something wrong
with the user mental model.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.360
Or with the way you're reflecting
the real world metaphors

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.420
of the user mental model.

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:20.800
So when you're designing
your main windows,

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.500
keep things simple and clean.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.500
Don't overload the user with too
many controls and too many things.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.490
Think about what's the most important.

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.500
Why is it on screen?

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.500
What should be on screen
relative to what's not on screen?

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.730
In other words,
if it's on the main screen,

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:38.490
it should be something that
is frequently accessed.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:41.500
Either every time you launch the
application and the window opens,

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:43.980
every time the project is open,
let's say,

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:45.490
or every time a selection is made.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:50.170
If it's highly, if it's frequently used,
it should be on the main interface.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.500
If it's not, then it should be elsewhere.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.700
Second point here is basically if
it's not important and shouldn't

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.660
be on the main interface,
then it's a secondary item.

00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.880
It could be a tertiary feature.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.370
But for some reason,
even though the human eye reads

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:04.610
from top left to bottom right,
in other words,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.620
the top left corner is the most important
part of your application's interface,

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:13.440
the first thing I see in so many
apps is a preferences toolbar icon.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.700
It's like, well,
how often do I go to preferences?

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:18.110
I shouldn't have to
go there often at all.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:23.200
And you've got the preference icon in the
most important spot on your interface?

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.960
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.860
So when you start to look at this stuff,
you realize, you know what?

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.280
We can get rid of half these icons.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.380
They are so infrequently used,
they don't need to be there.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.760
So always ask when you're
looking at this whole process,

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:39.340
what's important now in terms of the
context the user's in at that point?

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.890
Anyway, there you go.

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:42.060
Don't overload.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.350
Keep things fresh.

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.840
And I'd like to bring up
a last third party here,

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.620
Mike Mattis,
who's the designer for Delish Library,

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.440
and he's going to talk about
how they've done some of this

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.220
stuff in their application.

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:55.540
Thanks, John.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.390
So I'm the president of
Delicious Monster Software.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.020
I also design our icons,
like this one right here.

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:06.540
And I design our interfaces.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.780
This is the interface
for Delicious Library.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.180
It's our media cataloging software.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:16.620
And how it works is you take a movie,
or a book, or a CD, or a video game.

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:19.920
You hold your iSight up to
the barcode on the back of it.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.230
And it scans the barcode.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.000
It goes out on the internet,
downloads a ton of

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.960
information about that item,
and puts it into this catalog

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.300
where you can browse through it.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.440
You can search.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.900
You can check stuff out to
friends from your address book

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.640
and keep track of all your stuff.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.080
So it's really nice.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:38.940
It's a really simple interface
and this is really important.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.110
We wanted to make a program
that anyone could use.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.740
Not something that hardcore
collectors would only like or

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:49.540
public libraries would only use.

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.990
We wanted something that anyone would
appreciate and anyone who didn't even

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:57.450
think they would like this program
would pick it up and immediately

00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:59.910
see the value and have fun using it.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:05.360
So our interface is made up of
these five different pieces here.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.040
And each one of these pieces is
like a home for our features.

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:13.520
And each feature lives in this
home with its brothers and sisters.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:19.310
And this way if you know one feature,
you'll intuitively know where

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:23.750
the brothers and sisters
for this feature live.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.750
It's like a...

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.750
It's like in your kitchen where
you have your knives and your

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:30.640
forks next to each other and you
have your spoons next to those.

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:35.350
And so if a friend comes over
one day and they want a spoon,

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.100
you tell them go to this
drawer and get a spoon.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.830
The next day they come over,
they don't need to ask you where

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:43.560
to get a fork because they know it
lives next to the spoon intuitively.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:48.110
And so that's the concept behind
grouping your features like this.

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:52.500
And so the first group we have
here is the collections area.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.900
And this is where our most
broad categories are stored.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.620
Stuff like just all your books,
all your movies,

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.050
any collections that you've made.

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:05.660
Then we have your borrowers area
where people you've added from your

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.460
address book go and you can check
stuff out to people right here.

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:13.680
You just drag a book onto their
name and it checks it out to them.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.940
Then we have your bookshelf area and
this is where you browse all your books.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.090
And like John was saying,
this is the heart of our program.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:22.800
This is the star of the show right here.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.600
And in a screenshot you can just look
at our program and you immediately

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:28.460
know what the software does.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.460
Because it jumps right out of
you and it's right in the center.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.780
And then we have the details area.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.940
And this is where you view
all the details about an item.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.970
And there's tabs at the bottom.

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.000
There's three tabs.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.750
The first tab shows you
all the information we

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:43.000
download from the internet.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.520
The second tab,
it shows you any information

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.080
that you put in yourself.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.920
You can rate an item, you can put notes,
you can say if it's a rare item.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.280
And then the third tab gives you
similar items so you can find

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.200
new items that you want to buy.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.970
But those are all grouped under
one group because they're all

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:01.970
information about one item.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.180
And then we have this
button bar at the bottom.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:07.810
And this is where we thought
really hard about each button

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.110
we're going to put on here.

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:10.470
And we really refined this.

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:13.390
So like John was saying,
we're putting only buttons that we use

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.670
every single time you launch the program.

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:19.880
And stuff that 20% of the people use,
we'll put up in the menu bar, you know.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.820
You don't need to put all
those right on your interface.

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.440
And another thing to note
here is they're all underneath

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.970
the group that they apply to.

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:29.610
So you know when you
click the edit button,

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.000
it's going to edit the details.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.980
And you know when you
click the edit button,

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:31.980
it's going to edit the details.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.350
And you know when you click
the add collection button,

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.900
it's going to add a collection.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:38.680
Some of our competition,
they have a big toolbar at the top.

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.720
And they dump every single
one of their features into it.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.940
And it's in a total illogical order.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.510
And so you have no,
when you click something over here,

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:47.940
it does something over here.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.590
You click something here,
it does something over here.

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.590
With this,
you click it and it does exactly

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.160
what you want right above it.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.030
So, our interface is made
up of these five pieces,

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:05.100
and I think that makes it really easy
to figure out and learn and predict

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.710
where features are going to be once
you start learning the interface.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.960
So on top of having these groups,
these groups also flow

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.120
in a logical order.

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:16.490
So when you click on Movies here,
it brings up all your

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.040
movies in your bookshelf.

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.980
And when you click on a movie,
it brings up all the movie

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.020
details in the details area.

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:27.680
And so as you move left to right,
we go from more general to more detailed,

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.820
and you drill down on the
information you're trying to find.

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.840
And this makes it really
simple for people,

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.500
once again,
to predict the flow of your application.

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.540
So once you click on Movies
and you see all the movies

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.470
appear under the bookshelf,
when you click on a borrower beneath,

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:45.730
because it's right below the collections,
you'll intuitively know you're

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:48.360
going to see all the items that
are checked out to that person,

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:49.200
right?

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.540
Then our bookshelf area here,
like I was saying before,

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.500
it's the star of our program.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:02.180
It's what people first see when
they launch our program and

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:07.730
it's how people interact with
the main part of our program,

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.500
which is browsing all your collections.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.490
And lots of our competition
looks like this.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:20.700
And to us,
this was really just unacceptable.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.100
It wasn't going to do it, you know?

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.340
If we put this out,

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.820
I think our program would have just
blended in with everyone else's.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.260
It wouldn't have clicked.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.250
And it didn't click with us.

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:32.870
You know, you look at this,
and this is how you're

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.820
thinking of it as a developer,
right?

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:38.840
When you're writing the software,
you have all this information,

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.040
all this metadata on each one
of these items in a big list.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.210
And so you immediately think
this is the easiest way.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:49.180
You just drag it in from
Interface Builder and put all

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.400
this information in a big table.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.490
But we immediately realized
this isn't how people are used

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:55.580
to interacting with MacÂ OSÂ X.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.760
their media collections.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.640
They just took this item
off their bookshelf,

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.700
scanned it, and--

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:24.800
[Transcript missing]

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.360
So we grouped our features.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:32.160
People understand where to find features
once they start using the program.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.840
And they're all in a predictable flow.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.650
And we use these real world metaphors.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.990
And it makes our program
really easy to use,

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:41.100
really simple.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:46.740
And I think we've opened this kind of
product up to a much larger market now.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:51.030
Because it's much easier to use
and people are having fun with it.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.600
So thanks a lot.

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:55.530
I hope you guys can learn from this.

01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:03.520
All right, lots of stuff so far.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.390
You've seen three examples
of how developers have put

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.120
this stuff into practice.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.480
Now we're going to get
really nitty gritty.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.220
The basics.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.800
Here's a checklist that any man,
any designer, any woman, any person,

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.170
I call it every man's checklist,
but then a bunch of little

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.750
women I work with said,
that's not the right name.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.440
So let's just call it The Checklist.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.460
This is The Checklist, capital The.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.000
You're going to get
these slides eventually,

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:28.530
but this checklist is what you should,
anybody can do this.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.470
You know, not everybody is a Mike,
Mike Matos, right?

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.200
Guy's incredibly gifted.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.320
Not everybody's an Adam Baker,
incredibly gifted, you know, designer.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.100
There's lots of gifted designers,
but you guys maybe are, maybe aren't.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.000
I don't know.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.150
This list is the basics.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.090
If you get this down,
run through this checklist,

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.920
every time you create a product,
you're going to get something good.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.040
Avoid using solid black,
75% black instead.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.080
You can read the screen.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.370
Use white space effectively.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.400
I'm going to show you
the specific examples.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.920
Second part of the
checklist is label properly.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.200
Do the right thing with
the text on screen.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.350
Put colons after the, you know,
the label preceding a control.

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.010
And then we're going to show
you how to align those things.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.200
Capitalize effectively.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.170
Avoid mixing text sizes, etc.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.920
I still see this stuff today,
even though we've made great

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.430
progress in the last five years.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.230
And last point on the last bullet
was use user-centric terminology.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.100
When you've determined the mental model
the customer has and their terminology,

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.530
use their terms, not your terms.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.480
Avoid mixing control styles, sizes,
text sizes.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.140
Avoid overriding and changing behaviors.

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.390
If a push button,
if something looks like a push button,

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.640
it better behave like a push button.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:37.010
So let's apply this checklist
to some real world examples.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.810
Here's a dialogue from
a real MacÂ OSÂ X app.

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:40.620
Great app.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.800
Appreciate the developer
being on the platform.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.380
But there's a whole bunch of issues here.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.660
Well, you know, at first glance,
you guys might say, well,

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.170
it looks pretty good to me.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:51.430
Well, if you took the checklist
I just showed earlier,

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:53.120
for example, don't use solid black.

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.260
Here's a redundant heading, first of all,
because the list already tells

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.400
us what we're looking at.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.160
It tells us the name of the panel,
so why put it up there again?

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.840
And it's unnecessary use of black.

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:03.890
It's this big black bar.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.920
It's like, well,
that's not the look and feel of MacÂ OSÂ X.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.070
MacÂ OSÂ X is much more subtle,
much softer in terms of

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:10.280
presentation of information.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.400
What else is wrong here?

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.770
Well, this list actually contains
a non-standard font.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.800
It's not the bolding of the
headings inside of the list.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.930
The font itself doesn't match the
font on the right side of the screen.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.540
Another part of the checklist.

01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:25.290
Missing colons.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.310
I told you put colons after labels.

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:28.840
So there's missing
colons on those labels.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.220
By the way,
did you even know that those were labels?

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.060
Misaligned and orphaned items.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.940
I don't know what those items belong to.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.380
I don't know which checkbox
they're connected with.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.060
They're just sitting out there
in the middle of nowhere,

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.080
and I don't know what they are.

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:47.530
So as a user, this is a problem.

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:50.550
Because I glance at this dialog,
and I see lots of stuff,

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:52.770
but I don't know,
it's not clearly organized.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:56.190
I often can't see things,
even though they might be right there.

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:59.530
And it's a concept in interface
design called invisibility of items.

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:02.890
You don't want things to be invisible,
and that's why the use of white space

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.760
and margins is so important in Aqua.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.700
Because it lets you group things
so that people can find them.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.840
If they can't find them,
they're effectively invisible,

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.460
is my point.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.580
Random non-standard
spacing between controls.

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.840
You notice that each of these
highlighters is different sized.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.420
Just makes for a sloppy appearance.

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.970
Misuse of white space.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:25.400
There's just honking, I mean,
just freeways of white

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.220
space on this screen,
right?

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.450
Why is that?

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.940
Lastly, random button placement.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.100
I don't know why.

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:35.900
I don't know why, right?

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.460
This is the fun part of the session.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.380
So it's just, it's, and, and, you know,
I'm not picking on the developer, okay?

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.040
I mean, really,
we appreciate the product.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:43.620
We really do.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.660
This is just a good example for
illustrating some of this stuff.

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:46.790
Margins are too small.

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:48.270
Stuff's too close to the edges.

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:53.200
Alright, let's look at a renovated
version of that.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.990
So this is the same dialog redone.

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:57.610
We did it here at Apple.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.380
And let's look at what's right.

01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:00.850
Proper margins.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.230
Notice the green means good.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.640
Go.

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.710
Proper font.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.140
Right aligned labels.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.590
Notice the labels are all right aligned.

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:16.650
They all are jagged on the left,
but the right side is nice and straight.

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.540
Left-aligned controls.

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:21.260
Notice they all stack
up real nicely there.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.040
It looks really clean.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.320
How about spacing between items?

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.870
Equal spacing between items.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.100
larger spacing between unrelated items.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:37.110
Now you'll see that the thicker
green bar is actually the same

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:40.710
green bar as those upper two,
but it's on either side of that white,

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:43.500
of the gray line there.

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:44.800
Interesting.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:47.100
Same spacing,
but just put in there twice,

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:51.490
and it shows you that there's two
distinct portions to the screen.

01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:56.000
and then finally we got rid
of the OK cancel in fact,

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:58.070
and we just put a close
button on the window,

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.600
right?

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.770
Adds more modelessness
to the application,

01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:01.690
less modal dialog.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.630
OK and OK cancel is fine,
but in this case it was OK to do that.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.700
Here's another panel for this dialog.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:08.940
Big problem here,
as soon as you see repeating

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:11.650
interface like text that
repeats over and over and over,

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.120
red flag, red flag, okay?

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.390
You should instantly
start to say to yourself,

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:16.560
what's wrong with it?

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.510
Why am I doing this?

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:20.870
In this particular case, well anyway,
we're running out of time and

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:25.060
I don't have time to explain it,
but A lot of stuff going on

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.800
here and the solution was,
you know, there's too much redundancy.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.890
The solution was to kind of
redesign this thing and throw in

01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:35.640
a list because the list allows
for an unlimited number of items.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.280
We can actually turn on and off the
item on the left with the checkbox.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.690
We can click on the row item
and add--click on the plus,

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:45.400
minus to add rows,
and add the specific path by name or

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.440
go and choose it from the file system.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.980
It just addressed a
whole bunch of issues.

01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:51.510
Big change.

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:52.990
Here's another typical
scenario for clean up.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:54.620
If you look at this screen,
it looks pretty good.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:56.120
Sort of.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.300
But when you clean it up, you get this.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.440
Boom.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.220
New toolbar.

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.040
Boom.

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:04.590
New sidebar.

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.580
Let's look at that sidebar for a second.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.430
Notice how there's the Your Computer tab.

01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:09.220
There's one tab.

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:10.130
Don't have one tab.

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:11.860
Tabs are supposed to have, you know.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.030
And then it's got a
group box around that.

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:16.730
And it's just like, well,
isn't that just a label?

01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:17.360
Right?

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.100
So let's change the toolbar again.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:19.740
Boom.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.240
Sidebar.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.200
Right now it's just a
label with a folder,

01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:26.410
navigation, standard awkward controls,
nice clean layout of that list.

01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:28.320
And then the right side,
we've got a bunch of

01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:29.830
non-standard tabs up there.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:33.490
Local host, local host one,
some clipped controls, etc.

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:35.380
Just a little bit sloppiness.

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:37.210
So if we clean that up, boom.

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:38.190
Beautiful.

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:46.310
All right, here's a total disaster.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.640
You know, this is a big problem.

01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:51.710
Let me talk, I mean, for one thing,
the screen is blue and there's

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:52.920
absolutely no reason for it to be blue.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.160
And this developer, I talked to them and
I explained and they got it.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.550
They're going to make the changes.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.020
But I got permission to talk about
this and so I'll have to be gentle.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.100
But, you know, right side,
the scroll bar up there is

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:08.740
just going off and never,
never land.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.960
I don't know what's happening there.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.560
Just a complete, I mean,
look at the buttons down at the bottom.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.660
Okay, number one, you know, number two,
number three.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.150
I mean, you should not have to number
anything in your interface.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.310
People should just get it.

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:24.500
Mike gave a great example on the left
side how Delicious Library moves you

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.750
automatically from left to right.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.460
That's the way to design UI,
not this way, you know,

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.540
where you're forcing,
you're labeling things so users know

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.700
what to do first and second and third.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.230
And let me tell you how this works.

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.500
You first type in, this is a,
you generate, you go and do a query into

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:43.160
your whatever thing database
and you get some stuff back,

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:43.660
okay.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.050
And then you do some
more stuff and anyway,

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.280
I can't even explain it.

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.650
Actually,
I could but I'm running out of time.

01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:50.700
So anyway,
you type in your report up there,

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.110
the search name, you know.

01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:56.080
And then the next thing you do is you
click that button so it goes out to the

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:58.360
main window and gets some information.

01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:02.020
And then it pours it into that screen,
into that box right there.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.170
And then you go from there,
you look at that and you find

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.640
the keywords that you actually
want to search on because you

01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.640
can't find them in the real,
in the main interface.

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:11.700
And so you go over to the left side
here and you type in your query

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.780
and so you go down and you say and,
or null, null,

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.640
the software is too dumb to realize
you didn't type anything in the edit

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:20.800
field so you have to tell it there's
nothing in the edit field which is a,

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.200
so then you type in all this stuff,
then you go back up to the top

01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:25.640
and you click the find button.

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:28.720
Then you go back down here and
you click the number one button

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:31.280
and then you go across and click
number two and number three.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.150
And you have to get it that
way or the thing doesn't work.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.500
You know?

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.720
Yeah.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.760
And if I could just make a
note to the room director,

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:50.880
I'm just going to go slightly over time,
so fire me later.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.360
And so what we did is we took that
abomination and we cleaned it up.

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.360
We applied the white spacing.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.780
We made good use of white space.

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.260
We put the margins around it.

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.700
We put standard control.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.680
We changed all the text to
the right font and everything.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.590
Looks great.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.780
Right?

01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:15.500
It's lipstick on a pig, right?

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:18.370
This thing is ugly.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.200
It's still ugly, and it's ugly not from
a visual point of view,

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.340
but it is ugly from the way it works.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.980
It is a disaster from an
interaction point of view.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.870
And this is the hardest part to teach.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.900
I mean, I've run out of time here almost.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.650
And I haven't even, you know,
I wasn't going to cover interaction,

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.590
but I couldn't because people study
this for years and years and years,

01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:39.720
but it doesn't have to
be that complicated.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.850
Interaction is like what
Delicious Library did,

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:45.440
like what Billings did,
like what Real Basic did,

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.160
and like what so many
other developers have done.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.310
And if you think you've got
some screwed up software,

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.700
it's probably not this bad.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.570
And secondly, it's, you know,
come see us in the Interface Design Lab.

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:58.950
That's what we're there for,
and that's what I can work with you

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.420
over the course of the year for.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.160
So it might look great,
but it doesn't mean it is great.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:03.840
All right.

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:07.380
And another area that you can do in
terms of designing your interface,

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:09.540
you know, we talked about main window.

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.960
We talked about these dialogues
and the flow of stuff and the

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.250
look and feel and all this stuff.

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:15.700
All of that's important.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.570
But another area that's really
important to deliver a great

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.970
user experience in your product
is communicating effectively.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.840
And there are multiple
ways of communicating.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.620
The first thing to understand
is that this should parallel

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.500
the human interaction,
the human experience, right?

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.290
If you have somebody reporting to you,
you don't want them telling

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:33.760
you about everything they did.

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.610
Hey, boss, I went to get a coffee.

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:38.460
Hey, boss,
got some staples for the staples.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:38.460
Hey, boss, stapled the report.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:38.460
Oh, hey, excuse me.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:38.460
I photocopied the report.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:38.960
Excuse me.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.080
I photocopied that thing for you, right?

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.630
It's too much information, right?

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.120
And the same thing is true for software.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.200
And actually, equally,
on the human experience side,

01:12:46.330 --> 01:12:48.530
you don't want an employee, you know,
you don't want to task

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.410
somebody with something,
and then they run off,

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:52.490
and you never hear from them
for three and a half months,

01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:54.770
and suddenly they're showing
up at your office door saying,

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.280
well, actually,
it's not going to get done, you know?

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.120
So that's too little information.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.030
And the same thing is true with software.

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:04.570
Sometimes software just puts up too many
progress bars and too much information.

01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:06.920
I don't need to know the
byte count of the transfer.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.380
I just want to know whether it's,
you know,

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.800
I just want to know whether it's going to
take another five minutes or something.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.600
So you can communicate non-intrusively
and non-interruptively.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.820
It's important to keep users
informed about what's going on,

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.610
but you don't have to be modal and
jump in their face all the time

01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:22.080
and tell them what's going on.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.700
And so there's some appropriate
mechanism for communicating progress.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.620
A standard progress bar.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.660
A spinning gear.

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:34.660
But just make sure you position
it in a place that's consistent

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.420
and near maybe what the progress,
what specific is going on.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.710
So for example,
the download window in Safari or

01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:41.180
the spinning gears in Mail.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.730
You always look in the same spot to
see if Mail's going to do something,

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:47.520
or beside the inbox
when it's checking Mail.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.570
iTunes has a voice level indicator.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.220
It doesn't keep putting up a modal
dialogue saying your voice is at level

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.540
five or your voice is at level six.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.560
It does this kind of thing.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.560
It's non-interruptive.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.560
You can badge your dock icon.

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:03.920
Hey, there's mail.

01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:05.000
You don't get anybody's way.

01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:06.400
The user notices the red dot.

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.310
They pay attention.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.800
These are great ways to
communicate status to the users.

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:13.540
But then there are times
where there are things occur,

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.160
and you need to tell users
specifically what's going on.

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.260
The first thing is if you
run into this situation,

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.080
you should stop.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:23.000
If you get an error in your product,
you should stop and say, wait,

01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:27.710
can I redesign this thing so that the
error doesn't occur in the first place?

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:31.310
When the original Mac was being designed,
there's a great story about how

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:34.200
they were looking at the error
messages that came when people

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.640
would pop the floppy disk out.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.090
And so people were saving, saving,
and they'd just go, oh, give me the CD.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:40.420
Boom.

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.120
And the thing would go, oh, error.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.140
You can't save the file
because there's no floppy disk.

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.820
So the designers started to think, well,
no, no, no.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.500
What can we do?

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.680
And can we eliminate the condition
for the problem in the first place?

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:52.750
And they ended up with the original
floppy disk drive that required

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.640
you to first dismount the-- it
locked the thing in the drive.

01:14:56.690 --> 01:15:00.260
And so that just solved the
whole problem completely.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.370
So look to see if there's anything you
can do to get rid of the condition that

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.820
caused the error in the first place.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.530
But if it has to be there,
because there are lots

01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:08.680
of cases where it is,
you should give good error

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.900
messages and explain what happened,
why it happened, and what's the solution.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.720
All three of those are key
variables in that formula.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.900
So for example,
proper way to communicate.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.960
What happened?

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:24.240
The trip document
request cannot be saved.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:24.710
Why?

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.200
Because the disk work stuff is full.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.420
And then the solution is that.

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.860
This is the wrong way to communicate.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.840
This is equally the
wrong way to communicate.

01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:42.480
There was a problem syncing your .Mac
account error code EFMS error 114.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.220
Oh, I get it.

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:45.860
And then it says close.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:46.780
Close what?

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.100
My .Mac account?

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.600
You know, get rid of the close buttons,
folks.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.600
They don't mean what
users think they-- I mean,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.540
users are getting used to
it because they're adapting,

01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:02.220
but quite honestly,
it doesn't make any sense in

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:02.220
light of the text on most dialogs
where the close button is.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:11.850
Good one.

01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.640
Feedback error.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.940
It's just a funny joke.

01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:14.380
Come on.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.180
So this is poor communication,
but it's okay.

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.750
I mean, you know,
I wouldn't get you too bad.

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:20.810
It's an error message.

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:21.600
This is better.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.300
Same error, but a little bit more text.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.760
And finally,
this is the best way to communicate.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.930
So that's designing the interface.

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:33.530
It all matters because it generates
high customer productivity when your

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:36.850
product works the way they expect and
delivers the experience they want.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.090
You get customer satisfaction
because they love it.

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:43.540
You get great perceived value
from your customer base.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.820
There's lower cost of customer support.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.560
Costs you money to answer the phone and
address stupid problems that your product

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.220
could have addressed and gotten rid of.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.840
Faster and simpler implementation.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.950
If it's easy and simple
and focused solution,

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.250
you've got less code to write.

01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:59.120
It's competitive advantage,
all things being equal.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.610
One library management,
media management product

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.120
against delicious library.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.100
Delicious library wins, right?

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:05.380
Why?

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.140
Because they went above and beyond,
surprised and delighted,

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.450
integrated all the other stuff.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.460
Brand loyalty,
simpler manuals and online help.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.530
And there you are.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.920
Online is the interface documents,
MacÂ OSÂ X human interface guidelines,

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.180
Apple University guidelines.

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:21.380
Please send me email,
set up a meeting with me either at

01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:22.720
the conference or after the show.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.680
Come see us at the Interface Design Lab.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.540
Sign up for time.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.330
May you have a great week.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.780
Look forward to great products from you.

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.180
Thank you.
