WEBVTT

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.040
Good afternoon.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.000
My name is Christy Wyatt.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.940
I'm the director of Worldwide
Developer Relations.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.580
And we're here to talk about go-to-market
strategies and services for developers.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.120
Now, if you're an engineer here looking
for any technical content whatsoever,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.440
this is the advanced warning
that you should leave,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.560
because there is zero technical
content in this session whatsoever.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.720
This is a little bit of an experiment,
actually.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.010
We get asked a lot of times why we
talk-- why we don't talk to developers

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.550
at developer conference about how
they take the solutions they've

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.480
worked so hard to build to market.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.280
And maybe somebody is new
to the Apple community.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.360
Maybe they are new to selling software,
period, and they've never actually had to

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.190
take a product to market before.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.040
So we get a lot of questions
in developer relations.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.760
And we thought that we would do a
little trial this year and put in a

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.660
session on the grid to see if this was
the sort of content that developers

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.500
at this event might want to hear.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.750
Thank you.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.340
I believe in ending on a high note,
so thank you all for coming.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.620
These are some of the questions
we get asked all the time.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.100
My team specifically is responsible
for seeking out new partners and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120
taking partners to market and working
with partners on an ongoing basis.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.940
So these are the questions that
we get asked every single day.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.700
These are the questions that come into
our developer program every single day.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600
So we're going to go through the
top ten questions we get about

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.420
sales and marketing all the time.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.410
If you've been selling
products for a while,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.440
some of them may feel
a little rudimentary,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.590
but maybe there's a few things
that are Apple unique that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.920
you may learn this afternoon.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.920
The first question is what are the
key components of a go-to-market plan?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.910
If you've never actually had to
sell a piece of software before

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.060
or try to sell a product before,
all the different things you need

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.800
to do to launch a product might
be just a little bit overwhelming.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.110
So the things that we're going to focus
most specifically on this afternoon

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.720
are around marketing and sales.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.380
What are some easy ways or some
not-so-easy ways to market your product,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.140
and what are the different options
for taking that product to market?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.760
Retail, online, channels, direct,
and so forth.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.720
So starting off with marketing,
let's talk about marketing.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.020
We get asked a lot how to best do PR.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.360
Should I be doing PR because
I'm a small organization?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.820
Does it really make sense for me?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.160
Is it going to cost me a lot of money?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.020
PR, in fact,
could be probably one of the cheapest

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.890
forms of marketing and one of the
most effective if you do it right.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.930
Press releases don't cost a lot
to write or don't cost a lot to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.060
get out there and get posted,
but you have to think very clearly

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.130
about what it is that you're doing.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.480
The first thing you have to
understand is who's your customer

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.780
and who are you trying to get
to and who do they listen to?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.530
So what are the publications?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.690
What are the pages you're targeting?

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.940
Who are the influential journalists?

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.110
How do you identify the influencers?

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.820
And then creating a message that
is very clear about your product

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.340
and attractive to that market.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.530
Now that sounds really, really simple,
but oftentimes it's not.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.200
We see a lot of press releases
coming through that aren't

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.650
quite that crisp and clear.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.540
So you have to think really clearly
about your value proposition.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.710
And then repeat, repeat, repeat.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.930
The trick is saying the same thing
over and over and over and over

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.740
again until everybody knows what your
product and your brand stands for.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.940
So clear messaging.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.340
Identify the influencers.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.940
One other thing you might
want to think about,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.740
especially if you're just starting out,
is maybe getting some professional help.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.730
And I don't mean medical
professional help.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.050
Although if you've tried to
do this for a little while,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.140
you might require it.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.040
But we mean there's a lot of
really good freelancers out there

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.140
that make themselves available
to smaller organizations.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.540
They're incredibly easy to find.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.400
There's a URL here for an
association that freelancers make

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.140
themselves available through.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.390
One thing we would recommend is find
somebody who really understands the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.140
customers you're trying to get to.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.630
This could be a freelance person
who's really good at talking

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.300
to enterprise publications.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.100
And you're a consumer-focused product.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.380
That's probably not
going to work out really,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.900
really well.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.900
So try to find someone who understands
the market you're going after.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.390
And then try to get that
clear message and repeat,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.780
repeat, repeat.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.700
We've listed a couple of
the Apple publications.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.740
Some things you might want to
think about are do you want

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.680
to talk to the Apple press,
the people who write

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.900
about Apple all the time?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.490
Or do you want to talk to people
who are publications and journalists

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.700
who are in the vertical market
that you're trying to attract?

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.900
So, for example,
talking to the Apple publications

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.500
or talking to someone
specifically in the life sciences,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.830
like bio-IT world,
if you're writing an application

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.790
that's scientific in nature.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.140
It's really easy, generally,
to find the journalist

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.300
that you want to target.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.900
If you go to any one of these
publications and do a search on Apple,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.500
you're going to see who writes
about Apple all the time.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.970
And now you know who it is you
need to get your stuff in front of.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.650
A question we get all the time is
how do you get Apple to endorse

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.200
one of your press releases?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.830
And I'm just going to be really,
really honest, it's incredibly,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.740
incredibly hard.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.600
We're really,
really tough about press releases and

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.940
putting our name on third party things.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.300
Very few get Apple quotes.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.290
This event, for example, we had, I think,
18 at the very most and this is a huge,

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.060
huge event.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.420
Some of the things we look for is to
make sure that the press releases that

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.540
we're reviewing are very product related.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.820
They're about your products,
your customers.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.760
We never announce other people's things.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.640
We may support you in doing that.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.160
That you're going to distribute
them on a major news wire.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.500
So if it's not going through
a major news service,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.920
we won't even really consider it.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.040
And that it's identifiable to some
target market that we're looking at.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.020
And I know that's not on this list.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.440
We're going to talk to a little bit more
on how to get things in front of us.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.320
But these are some things to think about.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.620
And again, you know,
we're always excited to see

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.700
partners doing press releases
about Apple related software.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.000
We don't think that they all
necessarily need to be quoted by Apple.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.440
But these are some of the
things that we're looking for.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.380
Another thing to think about
is what are some major events?

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.220
If there's a lot of Apple media
going on around a major Apple event,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.560
that may or may not be a good
time for you to be talking about

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.880
your Apple related product.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.980
So what are the major Apple events?

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.500
I'll give you a hint.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.100
This is one.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.740
There's actually three that we
consider to be major Apple events.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.540
Apple Expo's in Paris this
year in September.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.500
Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.500
Always in San Francisco.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.930
Big,
big event for us even though it's not

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.500
an Apple specific and Apple only event.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.630
And then WWDC.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.860
Each one of these events is very unique
in how they work with third parties.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.220
But oftentimes they'll make
demo opportunities available

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.960
or booth opportunities.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.400
There may be PR opportunities.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.410
So you should go to the specific
websites and look for what are

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.720
the third party opportunities
around those different events.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720
Another thing you may want to
think about is what other events

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.680
is Apple participating in?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.770
So for example,
if you're writing education software,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.010
NECC is in two weeks.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.260
It's really pretty simple to
figure out whether Apple's going

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.840
to be at an event in a big way.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.740
You look at the exhibitors
list and if we're there,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.400
chances are someone from
Apple's going to be around.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.560
If you already have a booth planned
and you're going to be showing

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.060
Apple product in your booth,
we'd actually love to know.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.570
We oftentimes sort of plot out what
kind of Apple solutions are going to be

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.440
showing on the floor of any major event.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.560
And if you're showing your product,
we'd love to know about it.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.980
So we'll let you know how
to do that in a little bit.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:10:43.800
[Transcript missing]

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.460
Other online marketing opportunities.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.600
So not all the ways to market
with Apple are through Apple.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.600
So, for example,
VersionTracker is another

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.850
very well-trafficked site
for third-party products.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.770
We get a lot of folks that are
looking at the VersionTracker page and

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.930
then coming back and talking to us.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.620
So I've put the URL for that up here.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.650
Other Apple.com sites.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.080
So we get asked a lot how you
get on different Apple pages.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.420
So, for example,
sometimes we reference third-party

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.600
software on the server page or
on the ITPro page or on some of

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.470
the other creative markets pages.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:18.530
The answer is get your products
into MPG and the Downloads Guide.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.500
When we're looking for new solutions,
maybe things we've missed,

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.930
maybe new solutions in emerging markets,
that's where we go look.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.870
You know, the MPG, as we said,
is the most comprehensive software guide.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.610
And so when the teams that are
responsible for vertical markets

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.840
are looking for new content,
that's kind of where they go.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.340
So I would suggest you start there.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.190
Other online marketing opportunities,
sometimes banner ads.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.390
Banner ads obviously are
not necessarily free,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.370
so they're not as cost effective
as some of the other things

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.680
that we were talking about.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.400
But they can be equally effective.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.340
Some other things to think about are,
as I was saying before,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.090
try to identify the target site.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.000
Is it a Mac community you're
looking for or is it a vertical

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.580
community you're looking for?

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.500
So, does it make sense to post some sort
of banner ad on one of these very

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.890
Mac-specific URLs that we're listing
here or do you want to try to identify

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.030
sites that are well trafficked for the
target customer you're going after?

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.860
The other thing to think about is
whether you're really just trying

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.400
to build awareness or whether you're
actually trying to capture people.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.960
And so are you just trying to
put your graphic or your logo

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.030
and get your message up there,
or when they click through,

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.070
is there something specific
you want to do with them?

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.090
So then that kind of leads us to sales.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.640
If somebody clicks through and they
want to buy something from you,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.860
what is that call to action?

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.960
So I would have to say that by far the
biggest percentage of questions that

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.340
we get are around sales of products
and what is the most effective way to

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.530
sell products out to the Mac customers.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.870
Obviously there's many different
paths to market depending on what your

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.690
solution is and who your customer is.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.320
There's direct, retail, online,
through resellers or influencers or VARs.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.480
Direct we're not going to talk all
that much about this afternoon.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.810
If you're doing direct sales,
chances are you know

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.080
who your customers are.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.200
It's probably one of the most
expensive ways to go and sell

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.190
your product because you have
full-time people going and doing it.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.880
We're going to spend most of our time
this afternoon talking about retail,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.670
online, and resellers.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.330
So is retail right for me?

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.210
Apple, as a company,
might know something about retail.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.050
If you were in the keynote,
we definitely know how to make very

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.700
cool demos about our retail team,
because you saw that in the keynote.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.140
But actually, we've gotten a lot of
attention for retail.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.120
And so to talk a little bit
not just about Apple retail,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.070
but some things you might want to think
about in approaching retail in general,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.090
I want to introduce Carl Smit.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.750
Carl is the Retail Merchandising
Manager for the Apple Store for

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.440
software products,
and he's going to to talk a little

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.290
bit about retail strategies.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.060
Good afternoon.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:57.500
So I'm the Product Merchandising
Manager for software in

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.600
the Apple retail store.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.980
So all the software products.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.880
We have a few merchants.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.250
We have a different one for hardware.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.350
And then we have some for overseas,
but we all work pretty

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.230
closely together as a team.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.680
What I'm going to start with is
just weighing the cost versus

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:15.680
the benefits of entering retail

00:14:16.100 --> 00:17:06.900
[Transcript missing]

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.610
Publishers.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.640
So there are a lot of
different publishers,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.170
and a lot of them have different
levels of involvement as to whether

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.110
or not they pick up your product.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.810
Some of them want to be involved in
actual development of the product

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.080
and finishing the product along.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.020
Others want to be involved in packaging.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.020
Some are taking a very
active role in the marketing.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.360
But some of them don't do any of that.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.630
They really are acting
more like a distributor,

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.460
and it's just an easier method of entry
if you're having difficulty working with

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:45.170
one of the distributors and you want to
get into a retail channel more quickly.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.270
So it can vary.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.000
And there are publishers that
work through distributors,

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.700
and there are publishers who are direct.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.700
So there's no definite.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:00.560
A good example of a publisher is Aspire,
who does all the EA games,

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.860
and they pick up smaller titles.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.770
I don't know if any of you
are familiar with iSale,

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.680
which is a new product that
helps you sell products on eBay,

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.160
but they're working through Aspire.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:20.820
And Aspire is currently with Navarre,
and so that's how Apple Retail procures,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.860
say, iSale.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.590
It goes through the publisher,
through the distributor,

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.200
and then to the retailer.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.880
And the third general
category are vendor reps.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.130
And the best way to think of
them are like sales reps that

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.070
represent more than one category.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.260
So they're a lot of
different types of vendors.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.920
And they're really-- they
can give you some valuable

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:47.360
advice on what your product,
as far as packaging, marketing, PR.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.890
They usually have very good contacts
within the different retailers,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.210
and general sales channels,
for that matter, and also work with

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.180
publishers and distributors.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.520
So they can be very, very helpful,
depending on where you are in the--

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.510
in the sort of chain of development
and how much help you want.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.770
They tend to actively push your
product in the sales channels.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.850
I think when you're thinking
about all of these-- distributor,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.810
publisher, and vendor rep-- it's
important to remember that,

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.890
like anywhere in any business,
the level of service

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.380
they're providing you,
they're going to expect a level

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.690
of return for that service.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.500
So depending on-- that's going
to eke away at your profit.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.080
But they're providing
something that's valuable,

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.920
valuable to you.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.480
So it's really where you are
and what you're looking for,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.960
specifically, who would suit you best.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.140
And I would recommend
explore all of them.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:51.230
Don't rule anyone out early on,
because only in conversation

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.690
will you really learn what--
who might be best for you.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.950
Because you'll find that sometimes
a publisher may make sense for you,

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.440
and you may not have thought
that was the case when you

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.140
first started looking at it.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.320
So same thing with all the others,
of course.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.050
So-- Yeah.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.410
So the Apple store.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.700
I know most of you have
been in Apple stores.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.390
We're pretty proud of our stores.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.520
We're pretty excited.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.050
The growth's been phenomenal.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.930
We've got 109 stores,
some of you probably

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.800
at keynote on Monday.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.520
We just entered Canada in Toronto.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:32.070
We have three stores in the UK,
two stores, I'm sorry, in the UK now,

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.980
and three stores in Japan.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.740
And things are continuing to grow,
and boom,

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.510
this is a picture of our Regent Street.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.120
Now we're seeing over a
million customers a week,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.860
which is just that visibility I was
talking about in the beginning.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.780
There aren't a lot of, I mean,
there are online click-throughs,

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.360
but you're not getting the same kind
of visibility that you do with retail,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.740
where they're actually walking down
the aisle and picking up your box.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.820
And a million customers a week,
it's 140,000 a day, 1,400 customers.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.030
So that's a lot of customers per store.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.350
So the visibility you're getting
in Apple retail is incredible,

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.110
and it's that target
audience you're looking for.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.090
They're all Mac users,
and they're interested in Mac products,

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.280
Mac-specific products.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.690
Just showing you our sales,
and sales are continuing to

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.040
grow quarter over quarter.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.110
We're really pleased.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.430
All retailers are different.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.500
As I'm sure you guys
have seen in our stores,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.670
we care about some things a
lot more than other retailers.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:46.690
Best Buy, Comp, you'll see they're a lot
more promotional than we are.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.620
We're not about discounting.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.980
We're much more, we want the products to
stand for themselves.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.670
And because we don't
have as much space as,

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.790
say, a Fry's or a Best Buy,
we're really trying to

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.580
get the best of the best.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.620
And so while some things are general,
some things we care about a little bit

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.440
more than some of the other retailers.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.140
So when you're thinking about product,
it's again going back to

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.540
what I said in the beginning.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.020
Consumer-based products.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.000
While we carry some more high-end
products than other retailers,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.620
they still need to have consumer appeal,
broad-based consumer appeal.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:27.180
When they start getting too
specialized and too professional,

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.880
it probably starts making less sense.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.860
to be in the retail space.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.480
We always think about being
related to the digital hub.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.440
If you look at how our
stores are spread out,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.950
you have the home section,
the pro section, music, photo, movie.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.410
Those are the different zones.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.860
We sort of see how a consumer
interacts with their computer.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.630
And so the products that are
related to that are typically

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.200
our most successful products.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.720
And we also are always looking at
carrying the latest operating system.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.660
We're not interested in products
that were popular a year ago.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:09.120
We want the stuff that is the latest
and greatest and works with the absolute

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.670
brand new systems that we have out there.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.430
So those are just sort
of our restrictions.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.880
Packaging.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.030
We care a lot more about packaging
than any of our competitors.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:29.070
If you look in our stores,
we want it to be more of an experience

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.640
than an active selling environment.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.160
We want the packages to be attractive,
to look good on the shelves,

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.330
to be informative, so that if a customer
picks the product up,

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.120
they can quickly figure out
what the product is about.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.440
We don't carry jewel cases,
we don't have bulk stacks,

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.820
we don't have POPs,
we don't have end caps.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.930
We want the products to sit on
the shelves and sell themselves,

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.120
is really what we're looking for.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.280
So we're not interested
in bells and whistles.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.420
We want a product to really speak
for itself and its packaging.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:11.890
We prefer the smaller boxes,
and I put that in because some people

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.130
get surprised when they've spent
all this time working on a product

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.970
and they come out with this big box.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.140
Shelf space is a consideration
for all retailers,

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.490
and the smaller box allows
us to carry more merchandise.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.520
So whenever possible,
we prefer the smaller box.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.060
It's not that we want to give one
an unfair advantage over another,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.420
it's that we just have limited
shelf space and we want to be as

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.780
fair and representative to all.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:26:19.400
[Transcript missing]

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.440
Right store, right market.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.010
So that's been Apple's
strategy all along.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.200
We aim for the 50-yard line
in all of our retail spaces,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.870
and we have four general
footprints that we go in with.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:35.030
The San Francisco store here is
one of our high-profile stores.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.010
It's the two-story store,
which you'll see in Japan, you see on our

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.700
Regent Street store in the U.K.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.600
We have one in Soho, L.A.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.740
It is our biggest store.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.940
It gives us the flexibility to be able
to carry more titles in those spaces.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:57.690
So, you know, a lot of you think, okay,
am I going to make it into Apple retail,

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.310
and am I not?

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.360
And it's not an all or nothing.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.780
If you make it into Apple retail,
that doesn't necessarily mean you're

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.320
automatically in all of our stores.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.120
Typically what we do is we try
you in those high-profile stores,

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.180
and as you get more successful,
we roll you out to

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.450
these other footprints.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.880
The mini store is an example
that you'll see more in malls,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.730
the Stanford Mall, Oak Ridge Mall,
our mini stores.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.670
Small stores like the Burlingame store,
if any of you are in the area,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.750
you may know that store.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.360
And a large store is like our -- kind
of our -- more of our standard store,

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.240
which is like the Palo Alto store,
if any of you have seen

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.770
any of the Bay Area stores.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.130
That's about it.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.320
Thank you, Carl.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.120
I have to say that I think
getting into the Apple retail

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.170
store is probably the number one
question that we get all the time.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.210
Anybody who's got even the smallest
interest in getting in front of consumers

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.890
sees the Apple store as an excellent way.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.260
You're looking at it and you're thinking,
all of those people,

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.840
all of that exposure, Apple Retail,
any retail sounds like a great option,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.040
but all of those people that
want a part of the profit,

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.910
all of those things
I have to think about,

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.380
distributors, vendor reps, yada, yada,
yada.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.000
Maybe that's just a little too hard
for me for where I am right now.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.870
Maybe I'm not ready.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.900
Or maybe there's a better
way of selling my product.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.970
So what about online?

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.850
We see a lot of our vendors doing
various different online strategies,

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.770
online themselves,
online through partners.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.100
And so to talk a little bit
about some online strategies,

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.600
Eric Ronberg,
Eric is a Senior Manager for

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.590
Worldwide Online Apple Retail.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.680
I don't have a mic,
so I'll be on the mic right here.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.440
Thank you, Christy.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.800
I'm Eric Ronberg, as she mentioned.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.160
I manage third-party products
for the online store.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:57.390
And much of what Carl touched on is
very similar to what we go through

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.720
from an online store standpoint.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.710
There are definitely many
ways to go to market online.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.520
There is the opportunity to sell
direct through your own store,

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.540
if you will,
through your own online distribution.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:15.710
There's also websites, obviously,
like the Amazons of the world,

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.630
the buy.coms of the world.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.640
And there's also through
Apple Online Retail,

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640
which would be another option.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.370
There's also the great opportunity
for direct downloads as well,

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.760
directly from your site or
potentially from other sites,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.640
which is a very large opportunity.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.640
And there's also the
large and growing market.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.520
I believe there's even a
breakout tomorrow afternoon

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.640
to talk about that further.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.630
Selling through your own website,
obviously a very profitable channel.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.620
Less concern about packaging.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.630
Just really the key things there
becomes content and making sure

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.640
that you're addressing your
market and your target markets.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.630
Obviously, there's incredible growth
history with the online sales.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:58.630
We continue to see the same results
within our online store here at Apple.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.560
We're very open to the masses.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.530
So depending on where you want to
target and how you want to target it,

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.340
you can definitely hit a little
bit of everybody through the

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.560
online retail opportunities.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.740
Here's a couple of other retailers from
an online standpoint that you can do.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.990
So obviously there's
direct through your stores,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.530
through your own stores
if you were to sell it.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.080
But then there's also the
other players like Mall,

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.960
Buy.com, and Amazon.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.740
They carry pretty much everything.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.880
They offer very competitive pricing,
in many cases too competitive.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.450
And they're broad focused.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.750
The content is varying.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.270
So the content which we find on
Apple Retail is the most competitive.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.300
And that's one of the
most important things.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.500
So we're making sure that we
provide all the specifications,

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.530
all the content,
and everything that's needed to

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.890
make the purchase decision very easy
and let them find what they need.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.100
So, you know,
what about our channel here,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.340
the Apple Online Retail Store?

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.500
You know,
it's something we try and present

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.340
the premier online experience.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.250
You know, we try and provide a dedicated
site for Mac enthusiasts,

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.560
a premier destination point that's
there for everybody to find the latest

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.740
and greatest items for the Macintosh,
or iPod for that matter.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.440
They're obviously focused
towards the Mac customer.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.850
Our pricing is consistent.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.930
Typically,
we go to market with what you suggest

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.480
from a retail price point standpoint.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.590
We have millions of unique visitors
on a weekly basis versus just the

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.680
million that you get at retail.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.890
So it is a great exposure place,
and again,

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.390
it's one of the first places that
people who are using a Mac or

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.760
considering the Mac that they go to.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.090
Obviously, they go to Apple.com,
and then they check the store

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.180
to see what else we sell.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.080
So it's a great opportunity,
and there's also huge

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.700
international opportunities
where we have stores in Europe,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.860
Japan, Asia Pacific, Canada.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.840
So we're continuing to grow and
expand those markets as well.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.180
So it's a great worldwide opportunity.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.200
And that's just an example of one
of the learn mores that we have.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.880
When I talk about content
and how critical it is,

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.520
really highlighting the key
features and benefits and assets.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.120
And we continue to adapt
the functionality in our

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.240
store on a regular basis.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.060
You know,
things to think about obviously,

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.180
packaging, less of an issue,
the bigger the box,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.360
the better as far as I'm concerned.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.350
But the content, again, very critical.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:37.260
Attractive and informative when it comes
to image shots and features and benefits.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.880
You know, must have the right information
for the Mac customer,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.830
and again we have relatively
unlimited shelf space,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.890
but at the same time,
we are still very selective because we

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:51.470
wanted to make sure that it supports
the Apple platform and the Mac platform.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:34:19.200
[Transcript missing]

00:34:25.200 --> 00:36:26.000
[Transcript missing]

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:31.320
Another direct related program
that you should be aware of is

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.680
the Apple Consultants Network.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.660
Now consultants in our Consultants
Network are not necessarily resellers.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.750
So they don't necessarily resell product,
but they may offer other services.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:45.100
So they may do training,
they may do on-site services,

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.780
they may have a number of other
third-party certifications,

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.540
they may be aligned around a
specific set of third-party products.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.260
Oftentimes they team either with our
direct sales organizations or with

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.360
some of our other reseller channels.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.420
And they have a breadth of services.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.100
There's really three different ways
to engage with these influencers.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.310
And really you should think
about the Consultants Network as

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.660
a team of influencers.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.450
It's a very broad community.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.660
And though they're not, again,
directly reselling product,

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.660
they can influence a lot of direct
sales if you educate them well on your

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.500
product and give them the opportunity
to participate by either making them a

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:22.100
part of your beta program or offering
specific training benefits to them.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.900
Here's a URL to engage them.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.260
And these are all -- I'm going to show
you a couple of different links off

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.660
of the consultant.apple.com webpage.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.750
You could also become one.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.890
If you have a lot of access to direct
customers and you think you may want

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.330
to actually become an Apple consultant,
here's a URL for that.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.650
Or you may want to hire one.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.540
As I said, they actually have a breadth
of other services that they can

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.760
make available to your customer.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.060
And some of them may be very
complementary to the application of

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.760
the solution you're trying to sell.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.120
So I would encourage you to go to
these URLs and take a look at what

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.810
they can offer and see if there's
some way that you can enhance your

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.660
direct or your reseller strategy
by working with these folks.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.800
Thank you.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.160
Now each one of these are
very specific programs,

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.700
and it's a lot of sort of
point places to go and look.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.410
Within our developer program,
we try to look for very

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.300
broadly applicable programs.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.400
So are there programs that we can
offer through the Developer Connection

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.370
that are very broadly applicable
to a large number of developers?

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.900
And so to talk about a
few of those is Ed Prasek.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.940
Ed is on our Developer Connection team,
and he's the Senior Manager for

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.740
Developer Business Services.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.720
So in ADC, you know,
the thing we're all about is

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.560
you guys being successful.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.660
We want you guys to spend a lot
of time developing your products.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.600
And we want you to be successful.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.260
We want you to make money, lots of money.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.420
The more money you make,
the more successful you

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.750
are in the platform,
the more you can continue coming

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.450
out with those great products
that you do for the platform.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.040
And that makes us more successful.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.690
After all,
the platform is only as good as

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.300
the products you guys come out for.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.260
So it's all about money.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.320
Everything we do is about trying to
enhance your success in the marketplace.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.820
And there's a lot of programs,
in addition to what's

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.320
already been spoken about,
that you can take advantage

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.590
of to help you do that.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.640
As Christy touched on earlier,
one of them is the

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.790
Macintosh Products Guide.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.710
You know,
the guide has 47 million users a year,

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.650
and that's nothing to sneeze at.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.500
One thing you guys got to
remember is that when people

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.420
buy into the Mac platform,
one of the first places they want

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.550
to come to look for products for
the platform is back to Apple.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.360
They want to come back to Apple.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.160
They want to say, "Okay,
I got this great computer.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.760
What are the solutions that
are available for me to use?"

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.000
So they come back to Apple.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.590
And, you know,
that's the strength of the guide.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.920
You know, it's got over 23,000 products
available for the platform.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.660
They're all there.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.700
And you guys,
it's free to put your products in there.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.800
It doesn't cost you a dime to
list your products in there.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.120
Customers are actively looking for your
products and trying to make sure that

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.740
they know the new products are available
for them to use on the new machines

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.900
that they're buying and the projects
and solutions that they're looking

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.050
for for the tasks they want to do.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.760
You know,
we have an ad program at the Guide, too.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.560
So you guys can-- it's not just about
listing your products in the Guide.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.310
It's also giving you guys the ability
to market your products under Apple's

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.260
umbrella in the Products Guide.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.150
You know, advertising,
web advertising generally has

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:11.960
a click-to-purchase rate of,
I don't know, 0.1 or 0.2 percent,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.680
and that's the industry average.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.810
The Guide gets between 7 and 8
percent click-to-purchase rate.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:17.700
That's huge.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.140
That's well above the industry standard.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:24.580
And again, under Apple's umbrella,
you have a very active and qualified

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.130
audience that's coming to look
for information on your products,

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.970
the things you guys are
offering to the public,

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.890
what they can do with their computers.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.910
Some of the types of ads you can
take advantage of is a homepage

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:40.520
sponsorship ad on the Guide.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.680
Remember, the Guide has,
like Christy said earlier,

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.880
23,000 products.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.390
That's a sea of products.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.600
How do you make your product
stand out from the sea of

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.140
products that are in the Guide?

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.310
Well, you know, with the sponsorship ads
that we have in the Guide,

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.170
it draws immediate
attention to your product.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:59.230
You can use this type of program to
build awareness for your product,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.740
or to drive sales and
incremental revenue.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.150
Homepage sponsorship is
one of the strong ones.

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.960
Another great one is spotlight ads.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.780
You know, these are, these,
the bottom ones,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.780
the spotlight ads are driven more for
actually driving incremental sales.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.820
Another good one is all the Guide,
the back pages, are all category pages,

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.050
whether they be hardware or software.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.810
Customers go through and troll
when they're looking for specific

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.150
products for a technology.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.940
So, you know, the ads here,
if they're looking for product

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.000
or productivity utilities,
for example,

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.040
those ads right there jump out at them.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.030
They're immediately drawn to them,
and they get an exceedingly

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.710
high click-to-purchase rate.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.090
Another thing a lot of people do is,
you know, they don't know the specific

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.980
product they're looking for,
but they have a general idea,

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.810
so they use our search pages.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.890
The ads that are there
get an extremely high,

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.430
I think, you know,
like 18% click-to-purchase on

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.690
this particular page alone.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:53.840
And it's consistently in our top
10 most visited pages of the Guide.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.860
So that pulls exceedingly well for you,
too.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.330
And then all of the ads in
the Guide drive back to your

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.420
product description page.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.720
And it's not anything
that we put in there.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.400
You guys can go in there and
put this information in about

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.080
your product anytime you want.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.270
The only requirement is that
the product be shipping,

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.120
that customers can get their hands on it.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.290
You can go in there,
enter the information

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.260
as much as you want,
anytime you want,

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.130
change it anytime you want,
have your ad look any way you want,

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.680
and have it click through to
wherever you want it to go.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.820
If you got it carried in the Apple Store,
you know,

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.580
you can have it click to the Apple Store,
give the customer a one-click

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.760
purchase that goes right to
their shopping cart in the store.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.260
If you sell it directly
from your website,

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:33.360
take it there.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.220
It's up to you.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:38.020
It's an exceedingly powerful
marketing program for you guys

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.130
to use under Apple's umbrella.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.390
Take advantage of it.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.280
And you know, we have an online media kit
that tells you about all the

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.320
requirements for the guide,
ad size, and everything.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.800
We make it as easy as possible.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.140
The cost is pretty nominal.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.380
You know,
it's not a revenue-driven service.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.260
Everything that we make goes
back into servicing the guide.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.280
So, you know, we'll build something
that fits your budget.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.140
Again, the whole thing is there to
help you guys be as successful

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.800
as possible in the marketplace.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.290
URL for this is right here.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.460
And, you know,
if you don't want to write the URL,

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.720
you can go to the home page
of the product's guide.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:15.690
And at the very bottom,
it has a link there for the media kit.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.240
The next thing we do is we have a
program set up with our retail partners,

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.100
whether they be online like Mac Zone,
Club Mac, or the Apple Store itself,

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:30.070
and also some of our vertical partners
like B&H and Sweetwater and AudioMidi.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:34.150
And what this program is,
is it allows us to offer your

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:38.040
products to your customers,
an exclusive deal that

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.230
Apple markets them.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.890
So we tell our retail partners,
"Hey you guys,

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:46.740
you come up with some great deals
in conjunction with the developers.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.800
Let us know what they are.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:52.010
We'll market them to the world."
And we do market them to the world.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.590
As a matter of fact,
these are the retail partners

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.530
that are involved in it.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.400
There's 19 of them.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.790
They're the strongest,
they're the favorite of the

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.410
install base of the Mac platform.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:06.810
and over one million people use
Hot Deals to look for exclusive

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.740
offers on the products you guys
are offering to the retail partner.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.450
And this is even bigger
than the Products Guide.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.740
The Products Guide got seven to eight.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.070
The Hot Deals program has a
32% click-to-purchase rate.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.060
That is astronomical.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:25.120
Some of the participants have a
45 to 50% click-to-purchase rate.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:29.500
The lowest one in the program is
a 15.91 click-to-purchase rate.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.500
That's absolutely massive.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:32.900
These people are coming in.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.580
They're looking to buy.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.300
They're looking to buy your products.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.000
And this drives huge.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.340
And whenever the retailer updates their
offerings on their Hot Deals page,

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.630
we let the world know about it.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.930
So if you come up with a new offer,
Apple is letting the world know

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.390
through a variety of third-party
websites that such and such

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:54.420
retailer has the following special
offers on such and such a product.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.000
And it drives huge traffic.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.880
If you guys could see it,
you'd be very impressed

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.610
with the traffic stats.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.580
Again,
there's some requirements for Hot Deals.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.410
It's free.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.260
It doesn't cost you guys anything to do.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.340
But there's some specs and some
regulations that you have to follow.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.970
And it's just something you set
up with your retail partners that

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.420
you normally do business with.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.500
And they'll let us know
what you want to offer.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.020
So the URL,
just take advantage of that and get

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.220
all the information is right there.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.170
If you don't want to write that URL,
it's easily accessible from the homepage

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:27.930
of the Apple Developer Connection
website at developer.apple.com.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.990
And, you know,
there's been a lot of programs

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.210
that you've been given
information on so far today,

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.690
and instead of making you guys
click through all of the website

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.140
trying to find all this stuff,
there's a real easy quick start

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.240
guide at this URL here that
has links to all the various

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.320
programs we've been talking about,
and tons more.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.760
You know,
we've only scratched the surface of the

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.820
stuff that's available for you guys.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.210
So take advantage of it,
and with that I'll turn

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.860
it back over to Christy,
and we'll be there to answer

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.360
questions for you later on.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:57.790
Thank you.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.440
I think I'm in trouble.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.580
They all told me,
make sure you tell them that

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.270
we're going to put the URLs on
the website so they don't all

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.160
sit there writing them all down.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.950
So sorry about that if you guys were
sitting there writing them all down.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:18.210
So this was our Developer Top 10.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:22.200
These are the top 10 questions we
get around sales and marketing,

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.520
different programs
that we have available.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.350
We have people here to answer any
number of questions you may have.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.820
So we wanted to make sure we had lots of
time available to get to your questions.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.270
But the number one question that
we know you're all asking is,

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.600
can I talk to someone right now?

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.690
So I've come, I've built my product,
I've heard about all

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.660
these great programs.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.290
Is there someone in the room that
I can talk to because I don't think

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.000
Apple knows about my great solution?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.790
And the answer is absolutely yes.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.400
So we're going to do a little bit of Q&A.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.000
I have a whole panel of folks.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.520
We've also set up some specific URLs,
especially for the attendees

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.710
of this conference.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.300
These are not email addresses that
you're going to find out on the web.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.000
These are not on the web page, anyways.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.400
These go anywhere.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.020
These go straight into our
partnership manager's team

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.500
over the next little while.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.620
We wanted to, as I said,
use this conversation as a way to

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:12.040
gather input for what we could be
doing better around business and

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.470
marketing services and content
around the developer connection.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.090
So we've organized them according to the
kind of solutions you're trying to build.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.500
These will obviously be in the
slides that you'll get later as well.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:29.200
So with that, I wanted to mention one
other related session.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.200
There is a session tomorrow morning on
the Power Users Guide to the App Store.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.400
It's going to be about the
Apple Developer Connection.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.300
So they'll talk a little bit about
some of the marketing services

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.500
as well as all of the other
benefits of being an ADC member.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.700
And that session will
be tomorrow morning.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.060
So we would strongly recommend
you go and take a look at that.
