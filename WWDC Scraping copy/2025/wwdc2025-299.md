Search this video…Hello, and welcome to“Deliver age-appropriate experiences in your app”.I’m Austin, and I’m an Engineering Manager for iCloud Family.In this video, I will cover three topics.First, helping protect kids online.Then, I’ll go over the Declared Age Range framework.And lastly, I will show you how to request an age rangeand build a great age-appropriate experience.I'll start by going over the backgroundthat led us to create the Declared Age Range framework.At Apple, our goal is to create technologythat empowers people and enriches their liveswhile helping them stay safe online and protect their privacy.We want people of all ages to be able to have great,safe experiences with our products and services.In February 2025,Apple released a white paper called “Helping Protect Kids Online.”Protecting kids from online threats, whether they’re young children, preteens,or teenagers, requires constant effort.The digital world is increasingly complex,and the risks to families are ever-changing.Building on Apple's profound commitment to privacy, security, and safety,we are continuing to enhance the trusted tools that we provide to help parentsprotect their kids in a way that is designed around privacy.In March 2025, Apple launched a streamlined child setup flow.It enables child-appropriate default settingsif parents prefer to wait until later to finish setting up a child account.And in iOS 26, Apple is providing parents with the ability to easily correctthe age that’s associated with their child’s account,if it was previously set up incorrectly.Also, in iOS 26, the App Store’s global age ratingschanged to provide more granularity.There are now five categories: 4+, 9+, 13+, 16+, 18+.The ratings add more useful information on product pagesand give parents further insight into their kids’ experiences.And lastly is the introduction of the new Declared Age Range API,the focus of this video.Next, I’ll go over the specifics of the Declared Age Range framework.In an age-appropriate experience, the app can ask for an age range.The prompt itself is customized based on what the app requests,and the age of the user.Users can choose to share or not to share.Based on that decision, the app can tailor its experience.Here, the app is asking if the user is 16 or older.In order to preserve privacy, the app provides a set of agesthat are important to their experience.The API will then return an age range, which is a set of two numbers.This helps keep the birth date private.The user only has to reveal what’s necessaryin order to get the appropriate experience.Now, I will go through how different users can declare their age ranges.In this example, the app asks for the ages 13 and 16.Olivia is 14, so she can declare that she is in the 13 to 15 range.Emily is 9, so she can share that she is 12 or under.Ann is 42, so she can share that she is 16 or over.In each case, the birth date is not revealed to the app.The Declared Age Range framework is for child and teen experiences.Therefore, the API will set a regional max for any age provided.The max will always be the age of an adult in that region.Apps have their own unique requirements.Each app can specify up to three different ages in one request,which results in four different ranges.Each range must be at least two years in duration.Deciding which ages are right for your app is fundamentally aboutwhat experiences an app wants to present or hide from users of different ages.Some apps may base this off of regional requirementsor decide it’s required for the best experience.During child onboarding, a parent can learn more about Declared Age Range,confirm their child’s age,and choose which sharing option is appropriate for their child.A parent can also manage this by going to Family & Settings,tap on a child, go to Apple Account & Password,and then Age Range for Apps.You can also manage this on the child deviceby going to Apple Account and Settings, tap on Personal Information,and again, Age Range for Apps is shown.There are three different settings for this API.This user is in Always Share.Always Share automatically returns the age range that is asked by the app.If new information is revealed, a notification appears.This user is in Ask First.Ask First displays a prompt to choose whether to share or not.This user is in Never share.Never share always declines to share.Nothing is shown when an app requests for the user’s age.Keeping birth dates private is essential.So there are additional measures in the Declared Age Rangeframework to ensure privacy.When in Ask First, by default, it will only prompton the anniversary of the original response.Similarly, in Always Share, by default, it will only reveal new age informationon the anniversary of the original response.Here's an example.If a child turns 13 and crosses into a new age range,the API will still return 12 or under until the anniversary.Then, on the anniversary of the original age declaration,upon request, the API will then either automatically share or prompt to share.This helps protect users from revealing their birth date.Lastly, a user can also allow the app to repromptin order to receive the current age.For example, on the weekend after the user’s birthday,they are excited to get access to features for older children right away.They don’t have to wait for the anniversary.In Settings, age range for apps,they can force the cache to clear by going to a specific appand tapping Share Age Range again.This provides an app the updated age range responsethe next time the age is requested.Creating an age-appropriate experienceis really about modifying the features in your appto ensure they're suitable for users.To illustrate, I will go through the exerciseof building out the age-appropriate experience that I showed previously.Apps can now choose to change the experiencebased on whether it’s appropriate for the user’s age.In this case, the photo sharing featurewill be unavailable until the Landmarks appcan confirm the child's age range and determine that it's age-appropriate.To get started, you will need to add the Declared Age Rangecapability to your project.Go to the Signing and Capabilities tab in your projecttarget and click the plus button.Then select Declared Age Range.Now I’ll go into the sample app UI and start coding.Here is the Landmarks app.It shows a list of landmarks.When I tap, I’m taken to a detailed description.This is the landmarks detail view.This is where I’d like to add my new photo sharing feature.I add a variable that will keep track of whether my feature is enabled or not.Add an environment variable to help the API knowwhich window to display an alert on.This is important in use cases wherethere are multiple windows for your app, for example, on iPad or Mac.Then I add a button that checks whether it should be enabled.By default, it will be disabled.Now I will dive into requestAgeRangeHelper.This method contains all the logicfor requesting and receiving a response from the API.The API allows apps to specify ages at runtime.So for each region or use case, specify the agesthat apply to your app in that context.For the sake of time, I add a commentto later implement code to check which region the user is in.Request age range using requestAgeRange method.And provide the ages that you care about.In this case, I want to know if the user is 16 or older.I’m ready to implement the code that handles the response.The response will return an enum that will equal sharing or decline sharing.If the enum equals sharing, the user shared,and a lower and upper bound is returned.This represents the age range returned by the API.If the enum equals decline sharing, the user chose not to share.I will now check if the lower bound is greater than or equal to 16.If this is true, I can assume the upper bound is nil.As mentioned, upper and lower bound values can be nil.This is used to represent ranges like 12 or under,or ranges that don’t have an upper limit, like 16 or over.If they are 16 or over, I will enable the photo sharing button.If they are 15 or under, the button will remain disabled.If the age range is shared, you will also get back an ageRangeDeclaration value.For children, the value will always be guardianDeclared.For teens, if they are in an iCloud family, it will be guardianDeclared.If they are not in an iCloud family, it will be selfDeclared.For adults, the value will be selfDeclared. Now, back to the code.The API can also throw an error.I'll add some code to handle errors.Error invalidRequest is a developer generated error.It indicates that something is wrong with the request itself.For example, you have an age range that is not two years in duration.Error notAvailable indicates device configuration issuethat needs to be handled by the app.For example, the user hasn’t signed into the device with an Apple account.Now, I will put it all together and demonstrate the user experience.When I open the Landmarks detail view, an alertappears asking if I’d like to share that I’m 16 or older.I choose to share.As expected, the photo sharing experience is now available.There are a few more details that are helpful to know.Because the API will be called often,the system caches the responses so the user doesn’t constantlyhave to answer prompts.Practically speaking, this means apps won’t need to worrythat calling the API will prompt the user too many times.Cached responses are synced across devices.For example, a cached age range shared on iPhone will sync to Mac.Users can manage cache responses in Settings.Additionally, if the upper bound of an age rangeis below the age of majority, the APIreturns a set of additional parental controlsthat the parent has configured for the child.Here, I have code that checks to see if communication limitsis enabled for the child.To learn more about it,check out “Enhance child safety with PermissionKit.”Apps leveraging this framework are able to allow parents to be in controlof who a child can communicate with in third-party experiences.So that's the new API. Let me tell you about some other featuresyou can use to protect your users.Sensitive Content Analysis API helps apps provide a saferexperience in your app by detecting and alerting usersto nudity in images and videos before displaying them on screen.And in iOS 26, the Sensitive Content Analysis APIhas been expanded to detect and block nudity in live streaming video calls.The Screen Time Framework gives apps the tools neededto help parents and guardians supervisetheir children's web usage.And Family Controls helps apps provide their own parental controls on a device.Now you know about age appropriate experiences.Here's what you need to do next.Review Apple’s child safety tools at developer.apple.com,add age-appropriate experiences where they make sense,use the Declared Age Range framework to properlygate your age appropriate experiences.Thank you for adding age-appropriate experiences in your app.

This user is in Always Share.

Always Share automatically returns the age range that is asked by the app.

This user is in Ask First.

Ask First displays a prompt to choose whether to share or not.

This user is in Never share.Never share always declines to share.Nothing is shown when an app requests for the user’s age.

Keeping birth dates private is essential.

So there are additional measures in the Declared Age Rangeframework to ensure privacy.

When in Ask First, by default, it will only prompton the anniversary of the original response.

Similarly, in Always Share, by default, it will only reveal new age informationon the anniversary of the original response.

Here's an example.If a child turns 13 and crosses into a new age range,the API will still return 12 or under until the anniversary.

Then, on the anniversary of the original age declaration,upon request, the API will then either automatically share or prompt to share.

This helps protect users from revealing their birth date.

7:00 -Requesting an age range

You can now create age-appropriate experiences by modifying features based on user age. To achieve this, your app must enable the 'Declared Age Range' capability. 

You then add code to request the user's age range from the DeclaredAgeRange API. The API responds with an enum that indicates whether the user shared their age and, if so, the lower and upper bounds of the age range. The app then enables or disables specific features, such as a photo-sharing button, accordingly.

The system caches responses to avoid frequent user prompts, and these cached responses are synced across devices. People can manage their cached responses in the Settings app. Additionally, if the user is under the age of majority, the API returns a set of additional parental control settings.
