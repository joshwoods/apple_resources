Get to know the new design system

Search this video…Hi.I'm Franck,an engineer on the SwiftUI team.And in this video, you will learn how to build a great app with the new design.iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe introduce significant updatesto the look and feel of apps and system experiences.At the heart of these updatesis a brand new, adaptive material for controls and navigational elementsthat we call Liquid Glass.It takes inspiration from the optical properties of glassand the fluidity of liquid to create a lightweight, dynamic materialthat helps elevate the underlying content across various components.As you scroll through content,the glass automatically adapts to the content underneath,changing from light to dark.With a new and refreshed look across all platforms,controls come alive during interaction.Controls like toggles,segmented pickers,and slidersnow transform into liquid glass during interaction,creating a delightful experience!These updates apply across all the platforms that your app runs on.Watch “Meet Liquid Glass” for a deeper diveinto the design of this new material.Then, check out “Get to know the new design system”to learn best practices with the new design.Sometimes, in life, to gain clarity and focuson what’s truly important,you may need to re-invent yourself and look at the bigger picture.Today, I’m applying this wisdom to the Landmarks app,a sample project available on the Apple Developer website.I'll showcase elements of the new design system across Apple platformsand I’ll bring even greater clarity and focusto the Landmarks app by adopting the new APIs.When you build your app with the Xcode 26 SDKs,you'll notice changes throughout the UI.I’ll begin with updates to structural app componentslike TabView and NavigationSplitView.Then, I’ll cover the new look and behavior of toolbars.After that, I’ll share updates to the search experiencethat enhance consistency and ease of use.Then, I’ll show how controls come to life with Liquid Glass!I’ll finish by describing how you can adopt glassinto your own custom UI elements.In each of these five areas there are improvements you will get automaticallyand new APIs to customize the experience even further.App structure refers to the family of APIs that define how people navigate your app.These include views and modifiers likeNavigationSplitView, TabView and Sheets!Every one of these members is refined for the new design.NavigationSplitView allows navigating through a well-defined hierarchyof possibly many root categories.They now have a Liquid Glass sidebar that floats above your content.This breathtaking hero banner in Landmarks illustrates this,with the pink blossoms refracting against the sidebar.But the Landmarks team didn't travel to all these fantastic destinations,framing spectacular pictures only to have them appear clipped,no matter how gorgeous the sidebar is!With the new backgroundExtensionEffect modifier,views can extend outside the safe area, without clipping their content.If I hide the sidebar for a moment, you’ll see what’s happening behind it.The image is mirrored and blurred outside of the safe area,extending the artwork while leaving all its content visible.The new design makes inspectors shine, with more Liquid Glass!Opposite the sidebar in Landmarks, the inspector hosts contentwith a more subtle layering.This associates the inspector with its related selection.TabViews provide persistent, top-level navigation.They provide an overview of possibilities at a glanceand optimize for switching from section to section,maintaining context within each section.With the new design, the tab bar on iPhone floats above the content,and can be configured to minimize on scroll.This lets your app’s content remain the star of the show.To adopt this behavior, use the tabBarMinimizeBehavior modifier,In this example, the TV app uses the onScrollDown behavior.With this configuration,the tab bar re-expands when scrolling in the opposite direction.Now, suppose your app has additional controlsthat you want close at hand, like this playback view in Music.Place a view above the bar with the tabViewBottomAccessory modifier.This takes advantage of the extra spaceprovided by the tab bar’s collapsing behavior.Inside your accessory view,read the tabViewBottomAccessoryPlacement from the environment.Then, adjust the content of your accessory when it collapses into the tab bar area.Alright, I showed you how NavigationSplitViewis beautiful in Landmarks with the new design,and I shared ways you can adapt TabView-based apps too.Next, I’ll present sheets!When creating a collection of landmarks,a sheet of landmark options gets presented.On iOS 26, partial height sheets are inset by default with a Liquid Glass background.At smaller heights, the bottom edges pull in,nesting in the curved edges of the display.When transitioning to a full height sheet,the glass background gradually transitions,becoming opaque and anchoring to the edge of the screen.If you’ve used the presentationBackground modifierto apply a custom background to your sheets,consider removing that and let the new material shine.Sheets can also directly morph out of buttons that present them.To have the presentation content morph out of the source view,make the presenting toolbar item a source for a navigation zoom transition.And mark the content of your sheet as the destination of the transition.Like sheets, other presentations such as menus, alerts, and popoversflow smoothly out of liquid glass controls,drawing focus from their action to the presentation’s content.In the new design,dialogs also automatically morph out of the buttons that present them!With our app structure standing pretty strong,let’s move onto to toolbars!In the new design, toolbar items are placedon a Liquid Glass surface that floats above your app’s contentand automatically adapts to what’s beneath it.Toolbar items are automatically grouped.When I build the Landmarks app with Xcode 26,my custom toolbar items are grouped separately from the system-providedback button.I want to emphasize that the “favorite” and “add to collection” buttonsare related actions.So, I used the new ToolbarSpacer API with fixed spacingsto split them into their own group.This provides visual clarity that the grouped actions are related,while the separated actions, like the share link and inspector,have distinct behavior.ToolbarSpacer can also be used to create a flexible spacethat expands between toolbar items.The Mail app uses this technique to create a leading-aligned filter itemand a trailing-aligned group with the search and compose items.Some toolbar items can do without this visual grouping,like this item from Books showing my avatar.Apply the sharedBackgroundVisibility modifierto separate an item into its own group without a background.In the Landmarks app,I added a feature that allows friends to react to my landmarks collection.I would like to add an indicator on my notification itemwhen there is a new reaction.I don’t want to miss that sweet, sweet external validation.By using the badge modifier on toolbar itemsthat sweet validation is just one line of code away!I applied the badge modifier to my toolbar item’s contentto display this indicator.In addition to grouping and badging items in toolbars,the new design introduces a few other changes.Icons use monochrome rendering in more places, including in toolbars.The monochrome palette reduces visual noise,emphasizes your app’s content, and maintains legibility.You can still tint icons with a tint modifier,but use this to convey meaning, like a call to action or next step,but not just for visual effect.In the new design, an automatic scroll edge effectkeeps controls legible.It is a subtle blur and fade effect applied to content under system toolbars.If your app has any extra backgrounds or darkening effects behind the bar items,make sure to remove them, as these will interfere with the effect.For denser UIs with a lot of floating elements, like in the calendar app,tune the sharpness of the effect on your contentwith the scrollEdgeEffectStyle modifier.Turning from toolbars, next I’ll show how to craftcanny search experiences with the new design.There are some big updates to two key patterns for search across all platforms.Search in the toolbar places the field at the bottom of the screen,within easy reach.And on iPad and Mac, it appears in the top-trailing position of the toolbar.The second pattern is to treat it as a dedicated page in a multi-tab app.For the Landmarks app, I placed the search in the top trailing corner.When using this placement, you should make as much of your app’s contentavailable through search.The search field appears on its own Liquid Glass surface.A tap activates it and shows the keyboard.To get this variant in Landmarks, I applied the searchable modifieron the NavigationSplitView.Declaring the modifier hereindicates that search applies to the entire NavigationSplitView,not just one of the columns.On iPhone, this variant automatically adaptsto bring the search field at the bottom of the display.Depending on device size, number of toolbar buttons, and other factors,the system may choose to minimize the search field into a toolbar button,like the one shown here in Mail.When I tap on the button, a full-width search field appears above the keyboard.If you want to explicitly opt-in to the minimized behavior,say because search isn’t a main part of your app’s experience,use the new searchToolbarBehavior modifier.Searching in multi-tab apps is often done in a dedicated search page.The pattern is used by apps across all our platforms,such as the Health app to check my fitness trends.To do this in your app, set a search role on one of your tabsand place a searchable modifier on your TabView.When someone selects this tab, a search field takes the place of the tab bar,and the content of the tab is shown.People can interact with your browsing suggestions,or tap on the search field to bring up the keyboardand continue with specific search terms.On iPad and Mac, when someone selects the search tab,the search field appears centered above your apps browsing suggestions.These patterns give you flexibility and controlover the search experience in your app!Speaking of control, next I’ll turn to updates to standard controls.The new design creates a strong family resemblanceacross platforms for controls like buttons, sliders, menus, and more.I'm going to start with updates to buttons,one of the most common controls.Bordered buttons now have a capsule shape by default,harmonious with the curved corners of the new design.Mini, small, and medium size controls on macOS retain a rounded-rectangle shape,which preserves horizontal density.And the existing button border shape modifierenables you to specify the shape for any size.Control heights are updated for the new design.Most controls on macOS are slightly taller,providing a little more breathing room around the control label,and enhancing the size of the click targets.For compatibility with existing high-density layouts,like complex inspectors and popovers,the existing controlSize modifier can be applied to a single controlor across an entire set of controls.And for your most important, prominent actionsthere is now support for extra large sized buttons.Last but not least, the new glass and glass prominent button stylesbring Liquid Glass to any button in your app.Let's move onto Sliders, which have learned a few tricks too.They now support tick marks!The tick marks appear automaticallywhen initializing a slider with a step parameter.You can even manually place individual ticks.Use the ticks closure to specify their location,like I’m doing here for ticks at 60% and 90%.Sliders also let you start their track fill at a particular place.This is useful for values that may adjust left or rightfrom a non-leading default value,like selecting faster or slower speed values on playback.Specify the starting point with the neutralValue parameter.Menus across platforms have a new design and more consistent layout.Icons are consistently on the leading edge and are now used on macOS too.The same API using Label or standard control initializersnow create the same result on both platforms.In addition to updates to SwiftUI's controls,there are new APIs to update your controls for the new design.Many of our controls have their corners aligned perfectlywithin their containers,even if the container is your iPhone!This is called corner concentricity.For example,a button that is positioned at the bottom of a sheetshould share the same corner center with the corners of the sheet.To build views that automatically maintain concentricity with their container,use the concentric rectangle shape.Pass the containerConcentric configurationto the corner parameter of a rectangleand the shape will automatically match its containeracross different displays and window shapes.The best way to adopt the new design is to use standard app structures,toolbars, search placements, and controls.But sometimes, your app might need a bit more customization.Next, I’ll share how to build custom Liquid Glass elements for your app.Maps is a great example for this use-case with their custom glass controlsthat gracefully float above the map content.In a similar fashion, I’m going to add badges to the Landmarks appfor each landmark people visit.Let’s start by creating a custom badge view with the Liquid Glass effect!To add glass to your custom views, use the glassEffect modifier.By default, a glass effect will be applied within a capsule shapebehind your content.SwiftUI automatically uses a vibrant text colorthat adapts to maintain legibility against colorful backgrounds.Customize the shape of the glass effect by providing a shape to the modifier.For especially important views, use a tint modifier.Similar to toolbar buttons,only use this to convey meaning and not just for visual effect.And just like text within a glass effect, the tint also uses a vibrant colorthat adapts to the content behind it.On iOS, for custom controls or for containers with interactive elements,add the interactive modifier to the glass effect.Glass reacts to user interaction by scaling, bouncing, and shimmering,matching the effect provided by toolbar buttons and sliders.Now that we have our custom badge, let’s bring multiple badges togetherso they interact and blend with each other.To combine multiple glass elements, use the GlassEffectContainer.This grouping is essential for visual correctness.The glass material reflects and refracts lights,picking colors from nearby content.This effect is achieved by sampling content from an area larger than itself.However, glass can not sample other glass,so having nearby glass elements in different containerswill result in inconsistent behavior.Using a glass container allows these elementsto share their sampling region, providing a consistent visual result.In the Landmarks app, I am using the GlassEffectContainer to group my badges.When expanding my badges, I get this wonderful fluid morphing!Add these transitions to your own glass containerby using the glassEffectID modifier.To configure this, I first declare a local namespace.Then, I associate the namespacewith each of the glassEffect elements in my expanded stack of badgesand with my toolbar button.Now, when I tap the button again, the award badges are re-absorbed gracefully!The liquid glass effect offers an excellent wayto highlight the functionality that makes your app truly unique.I hope you enjoyed this quick tourof applying the new design and using Liquid Glass.Now it's your turn!Adopt the new design in your app by building it with Xcode 26.I think you’ll appreciate how much you get automatically with standard controls.Audit the flow of your app and identify whether any views need changes,paying special attention to background colors behind sheets and toolbarsthat you can remove.Finally, build expressive components with Liquid Glassthat truly make your app stand out.I hope you have a brilliant time playing with the new design!Keep on shining!

Hi.I'm Franck,an engineer on the SwiftUI team.And in this video, you will learn how to build a great app with the new design.iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe introduce significant updatesto the look and feel of apps and system experiences.At the heart of these updatesis a brand new, adaptive material for controls and navigational elementsthat we call Liquid Glass.It takes inspiration from the optical properties of glassand the fluidity of liquid to create a lightweight, dynamic materialthat helps elevate the underlying content across various components.

Then, check out “Get to know the new design system”to learn best practices with the new design.

Sometimes, in life, to gain clarity and focuson what’s truly important,you may need to re-invent yourself and look at the bigger picture.Today, I’m applying this wisdom to the Landmarks app,a sample project available on the Apple Developer website.I'll showcase elements of the new design system across Apple platformsand I’ll bring even greater clarity and focusto the Landmarks app by adopting the new APIs.When you build your app with the Xcode 26 SDKs,you'll notice changes throughout the UI.I’ll begin with updates to structural app componentslike TabView and NavigationSplitView.Then, I’ll cover the new look and behavior of toolbars.After that, I’ll share updates to the search experiencethat enhance consistency and ease of use.Then, I’ll show how controls come to life with Liquid Glass!I’ll finish by describing how you can adopt glassinto your own custom UI elements.

In each of these five areas there are improvements you will get automaticallyand new APIs to customize the experience even further.App structure refers to the family of APIs that define how people navigate your app.

These include views and modifiers likeNavigationSplitView, TabView and Sheets!Every one of these members is refined for the new design.NavigationSplitView allows navigating through a well-defined hierarchyof possibly many root categories.

They now have a Liquid Glass sidebar that floats above your content.

This breathtaking hero banner in Landmarks illustrates this,with the pink blossoms refracting against the sidebar.But the Landmarks team didn't travel to all these fantastic destinations,framing spectacular pictures only to have them appear clipped,no matter how gorgeous the sidebar is!With the new backgroundExtensionEffect modifier,views can extend outside the safe area, without clipping their content.

If I hide the sidebar for a moment, you’ll see what’s happening behind it.

The image is mirrored and blurred outside of the safe area,extending the artwork while leaving all its content visible.The new design makes inspectors shine, with more Liquid Glass!Opposite the sidebar in Landmarks, the inspector hosts contentwith a more subtle layering.This associates the inspector with its related selection.

TabViews provide persistent, top-level navigation.They provide an overview of possibilities at a glanceand optimize for switching from section to section,maintaining context within each section.

With the new design, the tab bar on iPhone floats above the content,and can be configured to minimize on scroll.

This lets your app’s content remain the star of the show.

To adopt this behavior, use the tabBarMinimizeBehavior modifier,In this example, the TV app uses the onScrollDown behavior.

With this configuration,the tab bar re-expands when scrolling in the opposite direction.

Now, suppose your app has additional controlsthat you want close at hand, like this playback view in Music.

Place a view above the bar with the tabViewBottomAccessory modifier.This takes advantage of the extra spaceprovided by the tab bar’s collapsing behavior.

Inside your accessory view,read the tabViewBottomAccessoryPlacement from the environment.Then, adjust the content of your accessory when it collapses into the tab bar area.

Alright, I showed you how NavigationSplitViewis beautiful in Landmarks with the new design,and I shared ways you can adapt TabView-based apps too.Next, I’ll present sheets!When creating a collection of landmarks,a sheet of landmark options gets presented.On iOS 26, partial height sheets are inset by default with a Liquid Glass background.

At smaller heights, the bottom edges pull in,nesting in the curved edges of the display.

When transitioning to a full height sheet,the glass background gradually transitions,becoming opaque and anchoring to the edge of the screen.

If you’ve used the presentationBackground modifierto apply a custom background to your sheets,consider removing that and let the new material shine.

Sheets can also directly morph out of buttons that present them.To have the presentation content morph out of the source view,make the presenting toolbar item a source for a navigation zoom transition.And mark the content of your sheet as the destination of the transition.

Like sheets, other presentations such as menus, alerts, and popoversflow smoothly out of liquid glass controls,drawing focus from their action to the presentation’s content.

In the new design,dialogs also automatically morph out of the buttons that present them!With our app structure standing pretty strong,let’s move onto to toolbars!In the new design, toolbar items are placedon a Liquid Glass surface that floats above your app’s contentand automatically adapts to what’s beneath it.Toolbar items are automatically grouped.When I build the Landmarks app with Xcode 26,my custom toolbar items are grouped separately from the system-providedback button.

I want to emphasize that the “favorite” and “add to collection” buttonsare related actions.So, I used the new ToolbarSpacer API with fixed spacingsto split them into their own group.

This provides visual clarity that the grouped actions are related,while the separated actions, like the share link and inspector,have distinct behavior.ToolbarSpacer can also be used to create a flexible spacethat expands between toolbar items.

The Mail app uses this technique to create a leading-aligned filter itemand a trailing-aligned group with the search and compose items.

Some toolbar items can do without this visual grouping,like this item from Books showing my avatar.Apply the sharedBackgroundVisibility modifierto separate an item into its own group without a background.

In the Landmarks app,I added a feature that allows friends to react to my landmarks collection.I would like to add an indicator on my notification itemwhen there is a new reaction.I don’t want to miss that sweet, sweet external validation.

By using the badge modifier on toolbar itemsthat sweet validation is just one line of code away!I applied the badge modifier to my toolbar item’s contentto display this indicator.

In addition to grouping and badging items in toolbars,the new design introduces a few other changes.Icons use monochrome rendering in more places, including in toolbars.

The monochrome palette reduces visual noise,emphasizes your app’s content, and maintains legibility.

You can still tint icons with a tint modifier,but use this to convey meaning, like a call to action or next step,but not just for visual effect.

In the new design, an automatic scroll edge effectkeeps controls legible.

It is a subtle blur and fade effect applied to content under system toolbars.If your app has any extra backgrounds or darkening effects behind the bar items,make sure to remove them, as these will interfere with the effect.

For denser UIs with a lot of floating elements, like in the calendar app,tune the sharpness of the effect on your contentwith the scrollEdgeEffectStyle modifier.

Turning from toolbars, next I’ll show how to craftcanny search experiences with the new design.There are some big updates to two key patterns for search across all platforms.

Search in the toolbar places the field at the bottom of the screen,within easy reach.

And on iPad and Mac, it appears in the top-trailing position of the toolbar.

The second pattern is to treat it as a dedicated page in a multi-tab app.For the Landmarks app, I placed the search in the top trailing corner.When using this placement, you should make as much of your app’s contentavailable through search.

The search field appears on its own Liquid Glass surface.

A tap activates it and shows the keyboard.To get this variant in Landmarks, I applied the searchable modifieron the NavigationSplitView.Declaring the modifier hereindicates that search applies to the entire NavigationSplitView,not just one of the columns.

On iPhone, this variant automatically adaptsto bring the search field at the bottom of the display.

Depending on device size, number of toolbar buttons, and other factors,the system may choose to minimize the search field into a toolbar button,like the one shown here in Mail.

When I tap on the button, a full-width search field appears above the keyboard.

If you want to explicitly opt-in to the minimized behavior,say because search isn’t a main part of your app’s experience,use the new searchToolbarBehavior modifier.

Searching in multi-tab apps is often done in a dedicated search page.The pattern is used by apps across all our platforms,such as the Health app to check my fitness trends.

To do this in your app, set a search role on one of your tabsand place a searchable modifier on your TabView.

When someone selects this tab, a search field takes the place of the tab bar,and the content of the tab is shown.

People can interact with your browsing suggestions,or tap on the search field to bring up the keyboardand continue with specific search terms.

On iPad and Mac, when someone selects the search tab,the search field appears centered above your apps browsing suggestions.These patterns give you flexibility and controlover the search experience in your app!Speaking of control, next I’ll turn to updates to standard controls.The new design creates a strong family resemblanceacross platforms for controls like buttons, sliders, menus, and more.

I'm going to start with updates to buttons,one of the most common controls.Bordered buttons now have a capsule shape by default,harmonious with the curved corners of the new design.Mini, small, and medium size controls on macOS retain a rounded-rectangle shape,which preserves horizontal density.

And the existing button border shape modifierenables you to specify the shape for any size.

Control heights are updated for the new design.

Most controls on macOS are slightly taller,providing a little more breathing room around the control label,and enhancing the size of the click targets.

For compatibility with existing high-density layouts,like complex inspectors and popovers,the existing controlSize modifier can be applied to a single controlor across an entire set of controls.And for your most important, prominent actionsthere is now support for extra large sized buttons.Last but not least, the new glass and glass prominent button stylesbring Liquid Glass to any button in your app.

Let's move onto Sliders, which have learned a few tricks too.

They now support tick marks!The tick marks appear automaticallywhen initializing a slider with a step parameter.

You can even manually place individual ticks.

Use the ticks closure to specify their location,like I’m doing here for ticks at 60% and 90%.

Sliders also let you start their track fill at a particular place.This is useful for values that may adjust left or rightfrom a non-leading default value,like selecting faster or slower speed values on playback.

Specify the starting point with the neutralValue parameter.Menus across platforms have a new design and more consistent layout.Icons are consistently on the leading edge and are now used on macOS too.The same API using Label or standard control initializersnow create the same result on both platforms.

In addition to updates to SwiftUI's controls,there are new APIs to update your controls for the new design.

Many of our controls have their corners aligned perfectlywithin their containers,even if the container is your iPhone!This is called corner concentricity.For example,a button that is positioned at the bottom of a sheetshould share the same corner center with the corners of the sheet.

To build views that automatically maintain concentricity with their container,use the concentric rectangle shape.Pass the containerConcentric configurationto the corner parameter of a rectangleand the shape will automatically match its containeracross different displays and window shapes.The best way to adopt the new design is to use standard app structures,toolbars, search placements, and controls.But sometimes, your app might need a bit more customization.Next, I’ll share how to build custom Liquid Glass elements for your app.

Maps is a great example for this use-case with their custom glass controlsthat gracefully float above the map content.

In a similar fashion, I’m going to add badges to the Landmarks appfor each landmark people visit.Let’s start by creating a custom badge view with the Liquid Glass effect!To add glass to your custom views, use the glassEffect modifier.By default, a glass effect will be applied within a capsule shapebehind your content.

SwiftUI automatically uses a vibrant text colorthat adapts to maintain legibility against colorful backgrounds.

Customize the shape of the glass effect by providing a shape to the modifier.

For especially important views, use a tint modifier.

Similar to toolbar buttons,only use this to convey meaning and not just for visual effect.

And just like text within a glass effect, the tint also uses a vibrant colorthat adapts to the content behind it.On iOS, for custom controls or for containers with interactive elements,add the interactive modifier to the glass effect.Glass reacts to user interaction by scaling, bouncing, and shimmering,matching the effect provided by toolbar buttons and sliders.Now that we have our custom badge, let’s bring multiple badges togetherso they interact and blend with each other.To combine multiple glass elements, use the GlassEffectContainer.This grouping is essential for visual correctness.The glass material reflects and refracts lights,picking colors from nearby content.

This effect is achieved by sampling content from an area larger than itself.

However, glass can not sample other glass,so having nearby glass elements in different containerswill result in inconsistent behavior.

Using a glass container allows these elementsto share their sampling region, providing a consistent visual result.

In the Landmarks app, I am using the GlassEffectContainer to group my badges.When expanding my badges, I get this wonderful fluid morphing!Add these transitions to your own glass containerby using the glassEffectID modifier.

To configure this, I first declare a local namespace.Then, I associate the namespacewith each of the glassEffect elements in my expanded stack of badgesand with my toolbar button.Now, when I tap the button again, the award badges are re-absorbed gracefully!The liquid glass effect offers an excellent wayto highlight the functionality that makes your app truly unique.

I hope you enjoyed this quick tourof applying the new design and using Liquid Glass.Now it's your turn!Adopt the new design in your app by building it with Xcode 26.I think you’ll appreciate how much you get automatically with standard controls.

Audit the flow of your app and identify whether any views need changes,paying special attention to background colors behind sheets and toolbarsthat you can remove.Finally, build expressive components with Liquid Glassthat truly make your app stand out.I hope you have a brilliant time playing with the new design!Keep on shining!

0:00 -IntroductioniOS 26 and macOS Tahoe introduce Liquid Glass, a new adaptive material for controls and navigational elements inspired by glass and liquid. This material changes color as someone scrolls and makes controls like toggles and sliders more interactive and visually appealing. 

The updates apply across all Apple platforms and include changes to structural components like TabView and NavigationSplitView, toolbars, search experiences, and the introduction of new APIs for developers to customize their apps' UI. 

The Landmarks app demonstrates these new features.3:07 -App structureApp structure is updated with refined APIs, including NavigationSplitView, TabView, and Sheets, all featuring the new Liquid Glass design. 

NavigationSplitView now has a floating Liquid Glass sidebar with a 'backgroundExtensionEffect' modifier that allows views to extend outside the safe area without clipping. 

TabViews on iPhone have a floating tab bar that can minimize on scroll, enhancing content visibility, and can include a bottom accessory view for additional controls.

Sheets now have a Liquid Glass background that transitions smoothly between partial and full heights. They can also morph out of presenting buttons, creating a seamless user experience. 

Other presentations like menus, alerts, and popovers also flow smoothly from Liquid Glass controls. Dialogs now automatically morph out of their presenting buttons.7:49 -ToolbarsThe new app design features floating toolbars on Liquid Glass surfaces with automatic item grouping. You can use the ToolbarSpacer API to create custom grouping and spacing, enhancing visual clarity. Add badges with a single line of code to indicate notifications. 

Monochrome icons reduce noise and an automatic scroll edge effect blurs content under toolbars for legibility. 

You can remove extra backgrounds and adjust for denser UIs.11:10 -SearchThe new design introduces two main search patterns across platforms:

Toolbar Search. The search field is at the bottom of the screen on iPhone, top-trailing on iPad/Mac, or minimized to a button which expands when tapped.

Dedicated Search Page. Search is accessed via a tab, replacing the tab bar with a search field and app content. The search field appears centered above suggestions on iPad and Mac.14:03 -ControlsThe new design introduces a consistent family resemblance across platforms for various controls. 

Buttons now have a capsule shape by default, with taller heights on macOS for better readability and larger click targets. Extra-large buttons and new glass styles are also available. Sliders now support tick marks, manual tick placement, and starting track fills from specific values. 

Menus have a fresh design with consistent icon placement across platforms. The new design also includes corner concentricity, ensuring controls align perfectly within their containers.17:57 -Liquid Glass effectsTo customize an app further, you can build custom Liquid Glass elements. For example, the Landmarks app uses badges with the Liquid Glass effect. To achieve this, apply the 'glassEffect' modifier to custom views, which you can shape and tint for emphasis. 

The 'interactive' modifier is now available for iOS controls to enable scaling, bouncing, and shimmering upon interaction. Group multiple glass elements within a 'GlassEffectContainer' to ensure consistent visual results because glass cannot sample other glass.

Create transitions between glass elements by using the 'glassEffectID' modifier, which allows for fluid morphing effects. This technique enhances an app's visual appeal and uniqueness, making it stand out.21:31 -Next stepsThe new design in Xcode 26 includes standard controls that provide automatic enhancements and Liquid Glass for creating expressive components. 

Audit your app flows, remove unnecessary background colors, and leverage Liquid Glass to make your apps stand out.

App structure is updated with refined APIs, including NavigationSplitView, TabView, and Sheets, all featuring the new Liquid Glass design. 

NavigationSplitView now has a floating Liquid Glass sidebar with a 'backgroundExtensionEffect' modifier that allows views to extend outside the safe area without clipping. 

TabViews on iPhone have a floating tab bar that can minimize on scroll, enhancing content visibility, and can include a bottom accessory view for additional controls.

Sheets now have a Liquid Glass background that transitions smoothly between partial and full heights. They can also morph out of presenting buttons, creating a seamless user experience. 

Other presentations like menus, alerts, and popovers also flow smoothly from Liquid Glass controls. Dialogs now automatically morph out of their presenting buttons.

7:49 -Toolbars

The new app design features floating toolbars on Liquid Glass surfaces with automatic item grouping. You can use the ToolbarSpacer API to create custom grouping and spacing, enhancing visual clarity. Add badges with a single line of code to indicate notifications. 

Monochrome icons reduce noise and an automatic scroll edge effect blurs content under toolbars for legibility. 

You can remove extra backgrounds and adjust for denser UIs.

11:10 -Search

The new design introduces two main search patterns across platforms:

Toolbar Search. The search field is at the bottom of the screen on iPhone, top-trailing on iPad/Mac, or minimized to a button which expands when tapped.

Dedicated Search Page. Search is accessed via a tab, replacing the tab bar with a search field and app content. The search field appears centered above suggestions on iPad and Mac.

14:03 -Controls

The new design introduces a consistent family resemblance across platforms for various controls. 

Buttons now have a capsule shape by default, with taller heights on macOS for better readability and larger click targets. Extra-large buttons and new glass styles are also available. Sliders now support tick marks, manual tick placement, and starting track fills from specific values. 

Menus have a fresh design with consistent icon placement across platforms. The new design also includes corner concentricity, ensuring controls align perfectly within their containers.

17:57 -Liquid Glass effects

To customize an app further, you can build custom Liquid Glass elements. For example, the Landmarks app uses badges with the Liquid Glass effect. To achieve this, apply the 'glassEffect' modifier to custom views, which you can shape and tint for emphasis. 

The 'interactive' modifier is now available for iOS controls to enable scaling, bouncing, and shimmering upon interaction. Group multiple glass elements within a 'GlassEffectContainer' to ensure consistent visual results because glass cannot sample other glass.

Create transitions between glass elements by using the 'glassEffectID' modifier, which allows for fluid morphing effects. This technique enhances an app's visual appeal and uniqueness, making it stand out.
