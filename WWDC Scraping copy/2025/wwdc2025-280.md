Search this video…Hi, I'm Max, an Engineer on the SwiftUI team,and I’m Jeremy, an engineer on the Swift standard libraries team!We’re both delighted to sharehow you can build rich text-editing experiencesusing the power of SwiftUIand AttributedString.Together with Jeremy’s help,I’ll cover all the important aspects of rich text experiences in SwiftUI:first, I’ll discuss upgrading TextEditorto support rich text using AttributedString.Then, I’ll build custom controls, enhancing my editor with unique features.And finally, I’ll create my own text formatting definitionso my editor - and its contents - always look great!Now, while I may be an engineer by day, I am also…a home cook on a mission to make the perfect croissant!So recently, I’ve been cooking up a little recipe editorto keep track of all my attempts!It has a list of recipes to the left,a TextEditor for editing the recipe text in the middle,and a list of ingredients in the inspector to the right.I’d love to make the most important parts of my recipe text stand outso I can easily catch them at a glance while cooking.Today I’ll make that possible by upgrading this editor to support rich text!Here is the editor view, implemented using SwiftUI’s TextEditor API.As indicated by the type of my text state,String, it currently only supports plaintext.I can just change String into AttributedString,dramatically increasing the view’s capabilities.Now that I have support for rich text,I can use the system UI for toggling boldnessand applying all kinds of other formatting,such as increasing the font size.I can now also insert Genmoji from the keyboard,and thanks to the semantic nature of SwiftUI’s Font and Color attributes,the new TextEditor can support Dark Mode and Dynamic Type as well!In fact, TextEditor supports boldness, italics,underline, strikethrough, custom fontspoint size, foreground and background colors,kerning, tracking, baseline offset, Genmoji, and…important aspects of paragraph styling!Line height, text alignment, and base writing direction are availableas separate independent AttributedString attributes for SwiftUI as well.All these attributes are consistent with SwiftUI’s non-editable Text,so you can just take the content of a TextEditor,and display it with Text later!Just like with Text, TextEditor substitutes the default valuecalculated from the environmentfor any AttributedStringKeys with a value of nil.Jeremy, I got to be honest here…I've managed my way through working with AttributedStrings so far,but I could really use a refresherto make sure all my knowledge is super solidbefore I get into building controls.Also, I really gotta make that croissant dough for later,so would you mind sharing a refresher while I do that?Sure thing Max!While you get started on preparing the croissant dough,I’ll take a moment to discuss some AttributedString basicsthat will come in handy when working with rich text editors.In short, AttributedStrings contain a sequence of charactersand a sequence of attribute runs.For example, this AttributedString stores the text, “Hello!Who’s ready to get cooking?”It also has three attribute runs:a starting run with just a font,a run with an additional foreground color applied,and a final run with just the font attribute.The AttributedString type fits right inalongside other Swift types you use throughout your apps.It’s a value type, and just like String from the standard library,it stores its contents using the UTF-8 encoding.AttributedString also provides conformances to many common Swift protocolssuch as Equatable, Hashable, Codable, and Sendable.The Apple SDKs ship with a variety of pre-defined attributes -like those Max shared earlier - grouped into attribute scopes.AttributedString also supports custom attributes that you define in your appfor styling personalized to your UI.I’ll create my AttributedString from earlier using a few lines of code.First, I create an AttributedString with the start of my text.Next, I create the string “cooking,” set its foreground color to orange,and append it to the text.Then, I complete the sentence with the ending question mark.Lastly I set the entire text’s font to the largeTitle font.Now, I’m ready to display it in my UI on my device!For more on the basics of creating AttributedStrings,as well as creating and using your own custom attributes and attribute scopes,check out the What’s new in Foundation session from WWDC 2021.Max, it looks like you’re done making the dough!Are you ready to dive into the details of using AttributedString in your recipe app?For sure, Jeremy, that sounds like just what I…kneaded.I’ve really been wanting to offer better controlsconnecting my text editor to the rest of my app.I want to build a button that allows meto add ingredients to the list in the inspector to the right,but without having to type out the name of the ingredient manually again.For example, I just want to be able to select the word “butter”that is already in my recipe,and mark it as an ingredient with a single press of a button.My inspector already defines a preference keythat I can use in my editor to suggest a new ingredient for the list.The value I pass to the preference view modifierwill bubble up the view hierarchyand can be read via the name “NewIngredientPreferenceKey”by any view that uses my recipe editor.Let me define a computed property for this value below my view body.All I need to provide for the suggestion is the name,as an AttributedString.Of course, I don’t just want to suggest the entire text that is in my editor.Instead, I want to suggest the text that is currently selected,like I showed with "butter."TextEditor communicates what is selected via the optional selection argument.Let me bind that to a local state of type AttributedTextSelection.Ok, now that I have all the context I need available in my view,let me head back to the property computing the ingredient suggestion.Now, I need to get the text that is selected.Let me try subscripting text with the resultof this indices function on selection.Hmm, that doesn’t seem to be the right type.It returns AttributedTextSelection.Indices.Let me look that up.Oh, that’s interesting,I just have one selection, but the Indices type’s second case,is represented by a set of ranges.Jeremy can you explain why that iswhile while I get to folding my croissant dough?Ha, that’s funny.I’m also folding - under the anticipation of these tasty croissants.But no worries Max,I’ll explain why this API doesn’t use the Range type you expected.To explain why this API uses a RangeSetand not a single Range, I’ll dive into AttributedString selections.I’ll discuss how multiple ranges can form selectionsand demonstrate how to use RangeSets in your code.You’ve likely used a single range in AttributedString APIsor other collection APIs before.A single range allows you to slice a portion of an AttributedStringand perform an action over that single chunk.For example, AttributedString provides APIsthat allow you to quickly apply an attributeto a portion of text all at once.I’ve used the .range(of:) API to find the range of the text “cooking”in my AttributedString.Next I use the subscript operator to slice the AttributedStringwith that range to make the entire word “cooking” orange.However, an AttributedString sliced with just one rangeisn’t enough to represent selections in a text editorthat works for all languages.For example, I might use this recipe app to store my recipe for Sufganiyotthat I plan to cook during the holidays which includes some Hebrew text.My recipe says to, “Put the Sufganiyot in the pan,”which uses English text for the instructionsand Hebrew text for the traditional name of the food.In the text editor, I’ll select a portion of the word “Sufganiyot”and the word “in” with just one selection.However, this is actually multiple ranges in the AttributedString!Since English is a left-to-right language, the editor lays out the sentence visuallyfrom the left side to the right side.However, the Hebrew portion, Sufganiyot, is laid out in the opposite directionsince Hebrew is a right-to-left language.While the bidirectional nature of this textaffects the visual layout on the screen,the AttributedString still stores all text in a consistent ordering.This ordering breaks apart my selection into two ranges:the start of the word “Sufganiyot”and the word “in,” excluding the end of the Hebrew text.This is why the SwiftUI text selection type uses multiple rangesrather than a single range.To learn more about localizing your app for bidirectional text,check out the Get it right (to left) session from WWDC 2022and this year’s Enhance your app’s multilingual experience session.To support these types of selections,AttributedString supports slicing with a RangeSet,the type Max noticed earlier in the selection API.Just like you can slice an AttributedString with a singular range,you can also slice it with a RangeSet to produce a discontiguous substring.In this case I’ve created a RangeSet using the .indices(where:) functionon the character view to find all uppercase characters in my text.Setting the foreground color to blue on this slicewill make all uppercase characters blue,leaving the other characters unmodified.SwiftUI also provides an equivalent subscript that slices an AttributedStringwith a selection directly.Hey Max, if you finished folding that beautiful croissant dough,I think using the subscript APIthat accepts a selection might resolve the build error in your code!Let me give that a try!I can just subscript text with the selection directly,and then transform the discontiguous AttributedSubstringinto a new AttributedString.That’s awesome!Now, when I run this on device, and select the word “butter,"SwiftUI automatically calls my propertynewIngredientSuggestion to compute the new value,which bubbles up to the rest of my app.My inspector then automatically adds the suggestionat the bottom of the ingredient list.From there, I can commit it to the ingredient list with a single tap!Features like that can elevate an editor, to a beautiful experience!I’m really happy with this addition,but with everything Jeremy has shown me so far, I think I can go even further!I want to better visualize the ingredients in the text itself!The first thing I need for that is a custom attributethat marks a range of text as an ingredient.Let me define this in a new file.This attribute’s Value will be the ID of the ingredient it refers to.Now, I’ll head back to the propertycomputing the IngredientSuggestion in the RecipeEditor file.IngredientSuggestion allows me to provide a closure as a second argument.This closure gets called when I press the plus buttonand the ingredient is added to the list.I will use that closure to mutate the editor text,marking up occurrences of the name with my Ingredient attribute.I get the ID of the newly created ingredient passed into the closure.Next, I need to find all the occurrencesof the suggested ingredient name in my text.I can do this by calling ranges(of:) on AttributedString’s characters view.Now that I have the ranges,I can just update the value of my ingredient attribute for each range!Here, I’m using a short namefor the IngredientAttribute I had already defined.Let’s give it a try!I don’t expect anything new here, after all,my custom attribute doesn’t have any formatting associated with it.Let me select “yeast” and press the plus button!Wait, what is that?!My cursor was at the top, not at the end!Let me try again!I select "salt,"press the plus button,and my selection jumps to the end!Jeremy, I have to roll out my croissant dough,so I can’t debug this right now…do you know why my selection is getting reset?That’s definitely not an experience we want for the cooks using your app!Why don’t you get started on rolling out the dough,and I’ll dive into this unexpected behavior.In order to demonstrate what’s happening here and how to fix it,I’ll explain the details of AttributedString indiceswhich form the ranges and text selections used by a rich TextEditor.AttributedString.Index represents a single location within your text.To support its powerful and performant design,AttributedString stores its contents in a tree structure,and its indices store paths through that tree.Since these indices form the building blocks of text selections in SwiftUI,the unexpected selection behavior in the appstems from how AttributedString indices behave within these trees.You should keep two key points in mind when working with AttributedString indices.First, any mutation to an AttributedString invalidates all of its indices,even those not within the bounds of the mutation.Recipes never turn out well when you use expired ingredients,and I can assure youthat you’ll feel the same way about using old indices with an AttributedString.Second, you should only use indices with the AttributedStringfrom which they were created.Now I’ll explore indices from the example AttributedString I created earlierto explain how they work!Like I mentioned, AttributedString stores its contents in a tree structure,and here I have a simplified example of that tree.Using a tree allows for better performance and avoids copying lots of datawhen mutating your text.AttributedString.Index references text by storing a path through the treeto the referenced location.This stored path allows AttributedStringto quickly locate specific text from an index,but it also means that the index contains informationabout the layout of the entire AttributedString’s tree.When you mutate an AttributedString, it might adjust the layout of the tree.This invalidates any previously recorded paths,even if the destination of that index still exists within the text.Additionally, even if two AttributedStrings have the same textand attribute content,their trees may have different layoutsmaking their indices incompatible with each other.Using an index to traverse these trees to find informationrequires using the index within one of AttributedString’s views.While indices are specific to a particular AttributedString,you can use them in any view from that string.Foundation provides views over the characters, or grapheme clusters,of the text content,the individual Unicode scalars that make up each character,and the attribute runs of the string.To learn more about the differencesbetween the character and Unicode scalar views,check out Apple’s developer documentation for the Swift Character type.You might also want to access lower level contentswhen interfacing with other string-like typesthat don’t use Swift’s Character type, such as NSString.AttributedString now also provides views into both the UTF-8 scalarsand the UTF-16 scalars of the text.These two views still share the same indices as all of the existing views.Now that I’ve discussed the details of indices and selections,I’ll revisit the problem that Max encountered with the recipe app.The onApply closure in the IngredientSuggestionmutates the attributed string,but it doesn’t update the indices in the selection!SwiftUI detects that these indices are no longer validand moves the selection to the end of the textto prevent the app from crashing.To fix this, use AttributedString APIs to update your indicesand selections when mutating text.Here, I have a simplified example of codethat has the same problem as the recipe app.First, I find the range of the word "cooking" in my text.Then, I set the range of “cooking” to an orange foreground colorand I also insert the word “chef” into my stringto add some more recipe theming.Mutating my text can change the layout of my AttributedString’s tree.Using the cookingRange variable after I’ve mutated my string is not valid.It might even crash the app.Instead, AttributedString provides a transform functionwhich takes a Range, or an array of Ranges,and a closure which mutates the provided AttributedString in-place.At the end of the closure,the transform function will update your provided rangewith new indices to ensure you can correctly use the rangein the resulting AttributedString.While the text may have shifted in the AttributedString,the range still pointsto the same semantic location - in this case, the word “cooking.”SwiftUI also provides an equivalent functionthat updates a selection instead of a range.Wow, Max, those croissants are really shaping up great!If you’re ready to get back to your app,I think using this new transform function will help get your code into shape too!Thank you!That sounds like just what I was looking for!Let me see if I can apply this in code.First, I shouldn’t loop over the ranges like that.By the time I reach the last range,the text has been mutated many times, and the indices are outdated.I can avoid that problem entirely by first converting my Ranges to a RangeSet.Then I can just slice with that and remove the loop.This way everything is one change,and I don’t need to update the remaining ranges after each mutation.Second, next to the ranges I want to change, there is also the selectionrepresenting my cursor position.I need to always make sure it matches the transformed text.I can do that using SwiftUI’stransform(updating:) overloadon AttributedString.Nice, now my selection is updated right as the text gets mutated!Let’s see if that worked!I can select “milk,” it appears in the list,and - when I add it - my selection remains intact!To double-check, when I press Command+B on the keyboard now,I can see the word “milk” turning bold - just as expected!Now that I have all the information in my recipe text,I want to emphasize the ingredients with some color!Thankfully, TextEditor provides a tool for that:the attributed text formatting definition protocol.A custom text formatting definition is all structured aroundwhich AttributedStringKeys your text editor responds to,and what values they might have.I already declared a type conformingto the AttributedTextFormattingDefinition protocol here.By default, the system uses the SwiftUIAttributes scope,with no constraints on the attributes’ values.In the scope for my recipe editor,I only want to allow foreground color, Genmoji,and my custom ingredient attribute.Back on my recipe editor,I can use the attributedTextFormattingDefinition modifierto pass my custom definition to SwiftUI’s TextEditor.With this change, my TextEditor will allow any ingredient, any Genmoji,and any foreground color.All of the other attributes now will assume their default value.Note that you can still change the default value for the entire editorby modifying the environment.Based on this change,TextEditor has already made some important changesto the system formatting UI.It no longer offers controls for changing the alignment,the line height, or font properties,since the respective AttributedStringKeys are not in my scope.However, I can still use the color control to apply arbitrary colors to my text,even if those colors don’t necessarily make sense.Oh no, the milk is gone!I really only want ingredients to be highlighted green,and everything else to use the default color.I can use SwiftUI’s AttributedTextValueConstraint protocolto implement this logic.Let me head back to the RecipeFormattingDefinition fileand declare the constraint.To conform to the AttributedTextValueConstraint protocol,I first specify the scope of the AttributedTextFormattingDefinitionit belongs to,and then the AttributedStringKey I want to constrain,in my case the foreground color attribute.The actual logic for constraining the attributelives in the constrain function.In that function, I set the value of the AttributeKey - the foreground color -to what I consider valid.In my case, the logic all depends on whether the ingredient attribute is set.If so, the foreground color should be green,otherwise it should be nilThis indicates TextEditor should substitute the default color.Now that I have defined the constraint,I just need to add it to the body of the AttributedTextFormattingDefinition.From here, SwiftUI takes care of all the rest.TextEditor automatically applies the definition and its constraintsto any part of the text before it appears on screen.All the ingredients are green now!Interestingly, TextEditor has disabled its color control,despite foreground color being in my formatting definition’s scope.This makes sense considering the IngredientsAreGreen constraint I added.The foreground color now solely dependson whether text is marked with the ingredient attribute.TextEditor automatically probes AttributedTextValueConstraintsto determine if a potential change is valid for the current selection.For example, I could try to set the foreground color of “milk” to white again.Running my IngredientsAreGreen constraint afterwardswould change the foreground color back to green,so TextEditor knows this is not a valid change and disables the control.My value constraint will also be applied to text I paste into my editor.When I copy an ingredient using Command+C and paste it again using Command+V,my custom ingredient attribute is preserved.With CodableAttributedStringKeys, this can even work across TextEditorsin different appsas long as both apps list the attributein their AttributedTextFormattingDefinition.This is pretty great,but there are still some things to improve:with my cursor at the end of the ingredient "milk,"I can delete characters or continue typing and it just behaves like regular text.This makes it feel like it is just green text,and not an ingredient with a certain name.To make this feel right,I want the ingredient attribute not to expand as I type at the end of its run.And I would like the foreground color to resetfor the entire word at once if I modify it.Jeremy, if I promise I’ll give you an extra croissant later,will you help me getting that implemented?Hmm… I’m not sure one's gonna be enough,but make it a few and you’ve got a deal, Max!While you go get those croissants in the oven,I’ll explain what APIs might help with this problem.With the formatting definition constraints that Max demonstrated,you can constrain which attributesand which specific values each text editor can display.To help with this new issue with the recipe editor,the AttributedStringKey protocol provides additional APIsto constrain how attribute values are mutatedacross changes to any AttributedString.When attributes declare constraints,AttributedString always keeps the attributes consistent with each otherand the text content to avoid unexpected statewith simpler and more performant code.I’ll dive into a few examples to explainwhen you might use these APIs for your attributes.First, I’ll discuss attributeswhose values are coupled with other content in the AttributedString,such as a spell checking attribute.Here, I have a spell checking attribute that indicates the word “ready”is misspelled via a dashed, red underline.After performing spell checking on my text,I need to make sure that the spell checking attributeremains only applied to the text that I have already validated.However, if I continue typing in my text editor,by default all attributes of the existing textare inherited by inserted text.This isn’t what I want for a spell checking attribute,so I’ll add a new property to my AttributedStringKey to correct this.By declaring an inheritedByAddedText property on my AttributedStringKey typewith a value of "false," any added text will not inherit this attribute value.Now, when adding new text to my string,the new text will not contain the spell checking attributesince I have not yet checked the spelling of those words.Unfortunately, I found another issue with this attribute.Now, when I add text to the middle of a word that was marked as misspelled,the attribute shows an awkward breakin the red line underneath the added text.Since my app hasn’t checked if this word is misspelled yet,what I really want is for the attribute to be removed from this wordto avoid stale information in my UI.To fix this problem, I’ll add another property to my AttributedStringKey type:the invalidationConditions property.This property declares situations when a run of this attributeshould be removed from the text.AttributedString provides conditions for when the text changesand when specific attributes change,and attribute keys can invalidate upon any number of conditions.In this case, I need to remove this attributewhenever the text of the attribute run changesso I’ll use the “textChanged” value.Now, inserting text into the middle of an attribute runwill invalidate the attribute across the entire run,ensuring that I avoid this inconsistent state in my UI.I think both of those APIsmight help keep the ingredient attribute valid in Max’s app!While Max is finishing up with the oven,I’ll demonstrate one more category of attributes:attributes that require consistent values across sections of text.For example, a paragraph alignment attribute.I can apply different alignments to each paragraph in my text,however just a single word cannot use a different alignmentthan the rest of the paragraph.To enforce this requirement during AttributedString mutations,I’ll declare a runBoundaries property on my AttributedStringKey type.Foundation supports limiting run boundaries to paragraph edges or the edgesof a specified character.In this case, I’ll define this attribute as constrained to paragraph boundariesto require that it has a consistent value from the start to the end of a paragraph.Now, this situation becomes impossible.If I apply a left alignment value to just one word in a paragraph,AttributedString automatically expands the attribute to the entire rangeof the paragraph.Additionally, when I enumerate the alignment attributeAttributedString enumerates each individual paragraph,even if two consecutive paragraphs contain the same attribute value.Other run boundaries behave the same:AttributedString expands values from one boundary to the nextand ensures enumerated runs break on every run boundary.Wow Max, those croissants smell delicious!If the croissasnts are all set in the oven,do you think some of these APIs might complement your formatting definitionto achieve the behavior you want for your custom attribute?That sounds like just the secret ingredient I needed!The croissants are all set in the oven, so I can try this out right away!In my custom IngredientAttribute here,I will implement the optional inheritedByAddedText requirementto have the value false,that way if I type after an ingredient, it won’t expand.Second, let me implement invalidationConditions with textChanged,so when I delete characters in an ingredientit will no longer be recognized!Let’s give it a try!When I add a “y” at the end of “milk,” the “y” is no longer green,and when I delete a character of “milk,”the ingredient attribute gets removed from the entire word at once.Based on my AttributedTextFormattingDefinition,the foreground color attribute continuesto follow my custom ingredient attribute’s behavior perfectly!Thank you Jeremy, this app really turned out great!No problem!Now, about those croissants you promised…Don’t worry, they’re almost ready.Why don’t you guard the oven though,since I’m slightly worried Luca might steal them away from us!Ah, THE Luca, I’ve heard of him,lover of all things widgets and croissants.I’m on it chef!Now, before I go join Jeremy,let me give you some final tips:You can download my app as a sample projectwhere you can learn more about using SwiftUI’sTransferable Wrapper for lossless drag and drop or export to RTFD,and persisting AttributedString with Swift Data.AttributedString is part of Swift’s open source Foundation project.Find its implementation on GitHub to contribute to its evolutionor get in touch with the community on the Swift forums!With the new TextEditor, it has also never been easierto add support for Genmoji input into your app,so consider doing that now!I just can’t wait to see how you will use this APIto upgrade text editing in your apps.Just a little sprinkle can make it pop!Mmm, so delicious!No, so RICH!

Hi, I'm Max, an Engineer on the SwiftUI team,and I’m Jeremy, an engineer on the Swift standard libraries team!We’re both delighted to sharehow you can build rich text-editing experiencesusing the power of SwiftUIand AttributedString.Together with Jeremy’s help,I’ll cover all the important aspects of rich text experiences in SwiftUI:first, I’ll discuss upgrading TextEditorto support rich text using AttributedString.Then, I’ll build custom controls, enhancing my editor with unique features.And finally, I’ll create my own text formatting definitionso my editor - and its contents - always look great!Now, while I may be an engineer by day, I am also…a home cook on a mission to make the perfect croissant!So recently, I’ve been cooking up a little recipe editorto keep track of all my attempts!It has a list of recipes to the left,a TextEditor for editing the recipe text in the middle,and a list of ingredients in the inspector to the right.I’d love to make the most important parts of my recipe text stand outso I can easily catch them at a glance while cooking.Today I’ll make that possible by upgrading this editor to support rich text!Here is the editor view, implemented using SwiftUI’s TextEditor API.As indicated by the type of my text state,String, it currently only supports plaintext.I can just change String into AttributedString,dramatically increasing the view’s capabilities.

Max, it looks like you’re done making the dough!Are you ready to dive into the details of using AttributedString in your recipe app?For sure, Jeremy, that sounds like just what I…kneaded.I’ve really been wanting to offer better controlsconnecting my text editor to the rest of my app.I want to build a button that allows meto add ingredients to the list in the inspector to the right,but without having to type out the name of the ingredient manually again.For example, I just want to be able to select the word “butter”that is already in my recipe,and mark it as an ingredient with a single press of a button.

My inspector already defines a preference keythat I can use in my editor to suggest a new ingredient for the list.

The value I pass to the preference view modifierwill bubble up the view hierarchyand can be read via the name “NewIngredientPreferenceKey”by any view that uses my recipe editor.

Let me define a computed property for this value below my view body.

All I need to provide for the suggestion is the name,as an AttributedString.Of course, I don’t just want to suggest the entire text that is in my editor.Instead, I want to suggest the text that is currently selected,like I showed with "butter."TextEditor communicates what is selected via the optional selection argument.

Let me bind that to a local state of type AttributedTextSelection.

Ok, now that I have all the context I need available in my view,let me head back to the property computing the ingredient suggestion.

Now, I need to get the text that is selected.

Let me try subscripting text with the resultof this indices function on selection.

Hmm, that doesn’t seem to be the right type.

It returns AttributedTextSelection.Indices.Let me look that up.

Oh, that’s interesting,I just have one selection, but the Indices type’s second case,is represented by a set of ranges.

Jeremy can you explain why that iswhile while I get to folding my croissant dough?Ha, that’s funny.I’m also folding - under the anticipation of these tasty croissants.But no worries Max,I’ll explain why this API doesn’t use the Range type you expected.To explain why this API uses a RangeSetand not a single Range, I’ll dive into AttributedString selections.I’ll discuss how multiple ranges can form selectionsand demonstrate how to use RangeSets in your code.You’ve likely used a single range in AttributedString APIsor other collection APIs before.A single range allows you to slice a portion of an AttributedStringand perform an action over that single chunk.For example, AttributedString provides APIsthat allow you to quickly apply an attributeto a portion of text all at once.I’ve used the .range(of:) API to find the range of the text “cooking”in my AttributedString.Next I use the subscript operator to slice the AttributedStringwith that range to make the entire word “cooking” orange.However, an AttributedString sliced with just one rangeisn’t enough to represent selections in a text editorthat works for all languages.For example, I might use this recipe app to store my recipe for Sufganiyotthat I plan to cook during the holidays which includes some Hebrew text.My recipe says to, “Put the Sufganiyot in the pan,”which uses English text for the instructionsand Hebrew text for the traditional name of the food.In the text editor, I’ll select a portion of the word “Sufganiyot”and the word “in” with just one selection.However, this is actually multiple ranges in the AttributedString!Since English is a left-to-right language, the editor lays out the sentence visuallyfrom the left side to the right side.However, the Hebrew portion, Sufganiyot, is laid out in the opposite directionsince Hebrew is a right-to-left language.While the bidirectional nature of this textaffects the visual layout on the screen,the AttributedString still stores all text in a consistent ordering.This ordering breaks apart my selection into two ranges:the start of the word “Sufganiyot”and the word “in,” excluding the end of the Hebrew text.This is why the SwiftUI text selection type uses multiple rangesrather than a single range.

To learn more about localizing your app for bidirectional text,check out the Get it right (to left) session from WWDC 2022and this year’s Enhance your app’s multilingual experience session.

To support these types of selections,AttributedString supports slicing with a RangeSet,the type Max noticed earlier in the selection API.Just like you can slice an AttributedString with a singular range,you can also slice it with a RangeSet to produce a discontiguous substring.In this case I’ve created a RangeSet using the .indices(where:) functionon the character view to find all uppercase characters in my text.Setting the foreground color to blue on this slicewill make all uppercase characters blue,leaving the other characters unmodified.SwiftUI also provides an equivalent subscript that slices an AttributedStringwith a selection directly.Hey Max, if you finished folding that beautiful croissant dough,I think using the subscript APIthat accepts a selection might resolve the build error in your code!Let me give that a try!I can just subscript text with the selection directly,and then transform the discontiguous AttributedSubstringinto a new AttributedString.

That’s awesome!Now, when I run this on device, and select the word “butter,"SwiftUI automatically calls my propertynewIngredientSuggestion to compute the new value,which bubbles up to the rest of my app.My inspector then automatically adds the suggestionat the bottom of the ingredient list.From there, I can commit it to the ingredient list with a single tap!Features like that can elevate an editor, to a beautiful experience!I’m really happy with this addition,but with everything Jeremy has shown me so far, I think I can go even further!I want to better visualize the ingredients in the text itself!The first thing I need for that is a custom attributethat marks a range of text as an ingredient.Let me define this in a new file.

This attribute’s Value will be the ID of the ingredient it refers to.Now, I’ll head back to the propertycomputing the IngredientSuggestion in the RecipeEditor file.

IngredientSuggestion allows me to provide a closure as a second argument.

This closure gets called when I press the plus buttonand the ingredient is added to the list.I will use that closure to mutate the editor text,marking up occurrences of the name with my Ingredient attribute.I get the ID of the newly created ingredient passed into the closure.

Next, I need to find all the occurrencesof the suggested ingredient name in my text.

I can do this by calling ranges(of:) on AttributedString’s characters view.

Now that I have the ranges,I can just update the value of my ingredient attribute for each range!Here, I’m using a short namefor the IngredientAttribute I had already defined.

Let’s give it a try!I don’t expect anything new here, after all,my custom attribute doesn’t have any formatting associated with it.Let me select “yeast” and press the plus button!Wait, what is that?!My cursor was at the top, not at the end!Let me try again!I select "salt,"press the plus button,and my selection jumps to the end!Jeremy, I have to roll out my croissant dough,so I can’t debug this right now…do you know why my selection is getting reset?That’s definitely not an experience we want for the cooks using your app!Why don’t you get started on rolling out the dough,and I’ll dive into this unexpected behavior.

In order to demonstrate what’s happening here and how to fix it,I’ll explain the details of AttributedString indiceswhich form the ranges and text selections used by a rich TextEditor.

AttributedString.Index represents a single location within your text.To support its powerful and performant design,AttributedString stores its contents in a tree structure,and its indices store paths through that tree.Since these indices form the building blocks of text selections in SwiftUI,the unexpected selection behavior in the appstems from how AttributedString indices behave within these trees.You should keep two key points in mind when working with AttributedString indices.First, any mutation to an AttributedString invalidates all of its indices,even those not within the bounds of the mutation.Recipes never turn out well when you use expired ingredients,and I can assure youthat you’ll feel the same way about using old indices with an AttributedString.Second, you should only use indices with the AttributedStringfrom which they were created.

Now I’ll explore indices from the example AttributedString I created earlierto explain how they work!Like I mentioned, AttributedString stores its contents in a tree structure,and here I have a simplified example of that tree.Using a tree allows for better performance and avoids copying lots of datawhen mutating your text.AttributedString.Index references text by storing a path through the treeto the referenced location.This stored path allows AttributedStringto quickly locate specific text from an index,but it also means that the index contains informationabout the layout of the entire AttributedString’s tree.When you mutate an AttributedString, it might adjust the layout of the tree.This invalidates any previously recorded paths,even if the destination of that index still exists within the text.

Additionally, even if two AttributedStrings have the same textand attribute content,their trees may have different layoutsmaking their indices incompatible with each other.

Using an index to traverse these trees to find informationrequires using the index within one of AttributedString’s views.While indices are specific to a particular AttributedString,you can use them in any view from that string.Foundation provides views over the characters, or grapheme clusters,of the text content,the individual Unicode scalars that make up each character,and the attribute runs of the string.To learn more about the differencesbetween the character and Unicode scalar views,check out Apple’s developer documentation for the Swift Character type.You might also want to access lower level contentswhen interfacing with other string-like typesthat don’t use Swift’s Character type, such as NSString.AttributedString now also provides views into both the UTF-8 scalarsand the UTF-16 scalars of the text.These two views still share the same indices as all of the existing views.

Now that I’ve discussed the details of indices and selections,I’ll revisit the problem that Max encountered with the recipe app.The onApply closure in the IngredientSuggestionmutates the attributed string,but it doesn’t update the indices in the selection!SwiftUI detects that these indices are no longer validand moves the selection to the end of the textto prevent the app from crashing.To fix this, use AttributedString APIs to update your indicesand selections when mutating text.Here, I have a simplified example of codethat has the same problem as the recipe app.First, I find the range of the word "cooking" in my text.Then, I set the range of “cooking” to an orange foreground colorand I also insert the word “chef” into my stringto add some more recipe theming.

Mutating my text can change the layout of my AttributedString’s tree.Using the cookingRange variable after I’ve mutated my string is not valid.It might even crash the app.Instead, AttributedString provides a transform functionwhich takes a Range, or an array of Ranges,and a closure which mutates the provided AttributedString in-place.At the end of the closure,the transform function will update your provided rangewith new indices to ensure you can correctly use the rangein the resulting AttributedString.While the text may have shifted in the AttributedString,the range still pointsto the same semantic location - in this case, the word “cooking.”SwiftUI also provides an equivalent functionthat updates a selection instead of a range.

Wow, Max, those croissants are really shaping up great!If you’re ready to get back to your app,I think using this new transform function will help get your code into shape too!Thank you!That sounds like just what I was looking for!Let me see if I can apply this in code.First, I shouldn’t loop over the ranges like that.By the time I reach the last range,the text has been mutated many times, and the indices are outdated.I can avoid that problem entirely by first converting my Ranges to a RangeSet.

Then I can just slice with that and remove the loop.

This way everything is one change,and I don’t need to update the remaining ranges after each mutation.

Second, next to the ranges I want to change, there is also the selectionrepresenting my cursor position.I need to always make sure it matches the transformed text.I can do that using SwiftUI’stransform(updating:) overloadon AttributedString.

Nice, now my selection is updated right as the text gets mutated!Let’s see if that worked!I can select “milk,” it appears in the list,and - when I add it - my selection remains intact!To double-check, when I press Command+B on the keyboard now,I can see the word “milk” turning bold - just as expected!Now that I have all the information in my recipe text,I want to emphasize the ingredients with some color!Thankfully, TextEditor provides a tool for that:the attributed text formatting definition protocol.A custom text formatting definition is all structured aroundwhich AttributedStringKeys your text editor responds to,and what values they might have.I already declared a type conformingto the AttributedTextFormattingDefinition protocol here.By default, the system uses the SwiftUIAttributes scope,with no constraints on the attributes’ values.

In the scope for my recipe editor,I only want to allow foreground color, Genmoji,and my custom ingredient attribute.

Back on my recipe editor,I can use the attributedTextFormattingDefinition modifierto pass my custom definition to SwiftUI’s TextEditor.

With this change, my TextEditor will allow any ingredient, any Genmoji,and any foreground color.

All of the other attributes now will assume their default value.Note that you can still change the default value for the entire editorby modifying the environment.Based on this change,TextEditor has already made some important changesto the system formatting UI.It no longer offers controls for changing the alignment,the line height, or font properties,since the respective AttributedStringKeys are not in my scope.However, I can still use the color control to apply arbitrary colors to my text,even if those colors don’t necessarily make sense.

Oh no, the milk is gone!I really only want ingredients to be highlighted green,and everything else to use the default color.I can use SwiftUI’s AttributedTextValueConstraint protocolto implement this logic.

Let me head back to the RecipeFormattingDefinition fileand declare the constraint.

To conform to the AttributedTextValueConstraint protocol,I first specify the scope of the AttributedTextFormattingDefinitionit belongs to,and then the AttributedStringKey I want to constrain,in my case the foreground color attribute.The actual logic for constraining the attributelives in the constrain function.In that function, I set the value of the AttributeKey - the foreground color -to what I consider valid.

In my case, the logic all depends on whether the ingredient attribute is set.

If so, the foreground color should be green,otherwise it should be nilThis indicates TextEditor should substitute the default color.

Now that I have defined the constraint,I just need to add it to the body of the AttributedTextFormattingDefinition.

From here, SwiftUI takes care of all the rest.TextEditor automatically applies the definition and its constraintsto any part of the text before it appears on screen.

All the ingredients are green now!Interestingly, TextEditor has disabled its color control,despite foreground color being in my formatting definition’s scope.This makes sense considering the IngredientsAreGreen constraint I added.The foreground color now solely dependson whether text is marked with the ingredient attribute.TextEditor automatically probes AttributedTextValueConstraintsto determine if a potential change is valid for the current selection.For example, I could try to set the foreground color of “milk” to white again.Running my IngredientsAreGreen constraint afterwardswould change the foreground color back to green,so TextEditor knows this is not a valid change and disables the control.My value constraint will also be applied to text I paste into my editor.When I copy an ingredient using Command+C and paste it again using Command+V,my custom ingredient attribute is preserved.With CodableAttributedStringKeys, this can even work across TextEditorsin different appsas long as both apps list the attributein their AttributedTextFormattingDefinition.

This is pretty great,but there are still some things to improve:with my cursor at the end of the ingredient "milk,"I can delete characters or continue typing and it just behaves like regular text.This makes it feel like it is just green text,and not an ingredient with a certain name.To make this feel right,I want the ingredient attribute not to expand as I type at the end of its run.And I would like the foreground color to resetfor the entire word at once if I modify it.

Jeremy, if I promise I’ll give you an extra croissant later,will you help me getting that implemented?Hmm… I’m not sure one's gonna be enough,but make it a few and you’ve got a deal, Max!While you go get those croissants in the oven,I’ll explain what APIs might help with this problem.With the formatting definition constraints that Max demonstrated,you can constrain which attributesand which specific values each text editor can display.To help with this new issue with the recipe editor,the AttributedStringKey protocol provides additional APIsto constrain how attribute values are mutatedacross changes to any AttributedString.When attributes declare constraints,AttributedString always keeps the attributes consistent with each otherand the text content to avoid unexpected statewith simpler and more performant code.I’ll dive into a few examples to explainwhen you might use these APIs for your attributes.First, I’ll discuss attributeswhose values are coupled with other content in the AttributedString,such as a spell checking attribute.

Here, I have a spell checking attribute that indicates the word “ready”is misspelled via a dashed, red underline.After performing spell checking on my text,I need to make sure that the spell checking attributeremains only applied to the text that I have already validated.However, if I continue typing in my text editor,by default all attributes of the existing textare inherited by inserted text.This isn’t what I want for a spell checking attribute,so I’ll add a new property to my AttributedStringKey to correct this.By declaring an inheritedByAddedText property on my AttributedStringKey typewith a value of "false," any added text will not inherit this attribute value.

Now, when adding new text to my string,the new text will not contain the spell checking attributesince I have not yet checked the spelling of those words.Unfortunately, I found another issue with this attribute.Now, when I add text to the middle of a word that was marked as misspelled,the attribute shows an awkward breakin the red line underneath the added text.Since my app hasn’t checked if this word is misspelled yet,what I really want is for the attribute to be removed from this wordto avoid stale information in my UI.To fix this problem, I’ll add another property to my AttributedStringKey type:the invalidationConditions property.This property declares situations when a run of this attributeshould be removed from the text.AttributedString provides conditions for when the text changesand when specific attributes change,and attribute keys can invalidate upon any number of conditions.In this case, I need to remove this attributewhenever the text of the attribute run changesso I’ll use the “textChanged” value.Now, inserting text into the middle of an attribute runwill invalidate the attribute across the entire run,ensuring that I avoid this inconsistent state in my UI.I think both of those APIsmight help keep the ingredient attribute valid in Max’s app!While Max is finishing up with the oven,I’ll demonstrate one more category of attributes:attributes that require consistent values across sections of text.For example, a paragraph alignment attribute.I can apply different alignments to each paragraph in my text,however just a single word cannot use a different alignmentthan the rest of the paragraph.To enforce this requirement during AttributedString mutations,I’ll declare a runBoundaries property on my AttributedStringKey type.Foundation supports limiting run boundaries to paragraph edges or the edgesof a specified character.In this case, I’ll define this attribute as constrained to paragraph boundariesto require that it has a consistent value from the start to the end of a paragraph.Now, this situation becomes impossible.If I apply a left alignment value to just one word in a paragraph,AttributedString automatically expands the attribute to the entire rangeof the paragraph.Additionally, when I enumerate the alignment attributeAttributedString enumerates each individual paragraph,even if two consecutive paragraphs contain the same attribute value.Other run boundaries behave the same:AttributedString expands values from one boundary to the nextand ensures enumerated runs break on every run boundary.

Wow Max, those croissants smell delicious!If the croissasnts are all set in the oven,do you think some of these APIs might complement your formatting definitionto achieve the behavior you want for your custom attribute?That sounds like just the secret ingredient I needed!The croissants are all set in the oven, so I can try this out right away!In my custom IngredientAttribute here,I will implement the optional inheritedByAddedText requirementto have the value false,that way if I type after an ingredient, it won’t expand.

Second, let me implement invalidationConditions with textChanged,so when I delete characters in an ingredientit will no longer be recognized!Let’s give it a try!When I add a “y” at the end of “milk,” the “y” is no longer green,and when I delete a character of “milk,”the ingredient attribute gets removed from the entire word at once.Based on my AttributedTextFormattingDefinition,the foreground color attribute continuesto follow my custom ingredient attribute’s behavior perfectly!Thank you Jeremy, this app really turned out great!No problem!Now, about those croissants you promised…Don’t worry, they’re almost ready.Why don’t you guard the oven though,since I’m slightly worried Luca might steal them away from us!Ah, THE Luca, I’ve heard of him,lover of all things widgets and croissants.I’m on it chef!Now, before I go join Jeremy,let me give you some final tips:You can download my app as a sample projectwhere you can learn more about using SwiftUI’sTransferable Wrapper for lossless drag and drop or export to RTFD,and persisting AttributedString with Swift Data.AttributedString is part of Swift’s open source Foundation project.Find its implementation on GitHub to contribute to its evolutionor get in touch with the community on the Swift forums!With the new TextEditor, it has also never been easierto add support for Genmoji input into your app,so consider doing that now!I just can’t wait to see how you will use this APIto upgrade text editing in your apps.Just a little sprinkle can make it pop!Mmm, so delicious!No, so RICH!
