Hello developers and welcome to the platform's State of the Union recap.

We've got a lot to cover so let's dive in and start with the beautiful new designthat offers you the perfect opportunity to refresh and modernize elements of your app.It's built with liquid glass, a dynamic materialthat enables an entirely new level of depth and vitalityby combining optical qualities of glass with a sense of fluidity.It brings greater focus to your contentand a greater harmony to your apps across Apple platforms.

And there's a new tool for creating those stunning layered icons for your app,Icon Composer, which gives you the ability to blur,adjust translucency, test specular highlightsand preview icons in various tints.

Okay, let's talk Apple Intelligence.You already know about writing tools, Genmoji and Image Playground.There's me.

Now it's time to meet the Foundation Models framework.Tell us all about it, Josh.The Foundation Models framework allows you to tapinto our highly optimized on-device Foundation model,which is specialized for everyday tasks.With this API, you can use the framework to power intelligent features in your app,using model capabilities such as text extraction,summarization and more.And since the model is on-device, your user's data stays private.It doesn't need to go to a server-side model or to anyone else.And it's all at no cost to you or your users for any requests.Thanks, Josh.Next up, we're excited to introduce Xcode 26 with integrated supportfor generative coding models.You can now use the model of your choice to help you write code,documentation, tests and more.
