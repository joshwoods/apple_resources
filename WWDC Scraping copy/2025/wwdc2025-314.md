Search this video…Hi, I’m Cathie from the Cryptography Engineering team.This video is about how you can get ahead with quantum secure cryptography.You create applications that occupy a privileged place in people’s lives.Your app can have access to personal and sensitive data about users,and uses cryptography to protect that data.However, the rise of quantum computingthreatens the security of this cryptography,with quantum attacks breaking or weakening many widely used algorithms.You need to get ahead of this risk by moving to quantum-secure cryptography.I'll start by going over different quantum attacks on cryptography,what protocols they affect,and how you can defend against them with quantum-secure cryptography.Next, I'll discuss how you should protect network data from quantum attacksby using quantum-secure encryption in TLS.Last, I’ll go over how you can protect custom protocolsby using the new quantum-secure APIs in CryptoKit.I’ll start with quantum attacks on cryptography.Think about an app that has access to personal and sensitive datalike health, location, and photos.It uses cryptography to protect this data.For example, it uploads this data to a server for backup and synchronizationacross devices.This data is protected with TLS.For these and many other workflows,cryptography is critical to the security of user data.However, this cryptography is under threat from quantum attacks.This includes encryption, which is used to ensure confidentiality of data,and signatures, which are used to ensure authenticity of data.Experts agree that sufficiently powerful quantum computers are on the horizon,and some quantum attacks are relevant now, even before these quantum computers exist.For example, an attacker can currently be harvesting encrypted datawith a harvest now, decrypt later attack.Here’s how the attack could work.Going back to the previous example,the app has sensitive user data like health, location, and photos,and wants to send it to the server.It encrypts the data with TLS and sends it.An attacker observing the network can harvest that encrypted data and store it.They can’t decrypt it just yet,but they can wait until they have access to a sufficiently powerfulquantum computer in in the future, and then decrypt the harvested datato gain access to the sensitive user data.The harvest now, decrypt later attackaffects encrypted data an attacker can access,especially data in transit.It affects apps that send data to a server, sync data across devices,or otherwise send encrypted data over the network.It breaks confidentiality,as the attacker can read the network traffic after decrypting it.Attackers can already be harvesting network traffic right now,so we all need to take steps now to mitigate this attack.In contrast with the passive harvest now, decrypt later attack,now I’ll go through an example of an active attack,where an attacker with a quantum computerneeds to be actively involved in the protocol.Imagine an example app that has a signing key tied to a user.The app uses that key to authenticate the user to the server with a signature.An attacker observing network traffic intercepts that signature.Using a sufficiently powerful quantum computer,they break the cryptography and steal the signing key.They use the stolen key to make a signature,which they send to the server to impersonate the user.The server accepts the attacker’s signature as if it came from the user.The attacker then carries out actions on behalf of the user.The active attack I went over affects signatures.It breaks authenticity, as the attacker can forge authenticationand carry out actions on behalf of the victim.It affects apps that perform user authentication,such as with WebAuth and multi-factor authentication,and apps that perform data authentication, such as with asset signing.It is a future threat because sufficiently powerful quantum computers don't yet existto carry out this attack.However, they are on the horizon.Quantum attacks are a very real threat to the securityof widely deployed cryptography.To get ahead of these attacks, the cryptography communityhas been focusing on creating and standardizing new algorithmsthat are secure against quantum attacks, known as quantum-secure cryptography.These algorithms are ready for adoption today.They can run on the classical, non-quantum computers that are being used today,but will remain secure from attacks by both classical and quantum computers.I’ll go into more detail, but keep in mind that even if the cryptography is complex,the fixes are straightforward.Cryptography can be divided into public-key and symmetric-key cryptography.These categories are affected differently by quantum attacks,and therefore have different mitigation strategies.I’ll start with public-key cryptography,which includes public-key encryption and signatures.Classical public-key cryptography is based on mathematical problemssuch as RSA and discrete log on elliptic curvesthat are too computationally intensive for classical computers to solve.However, quantum computers will be able to solve these problemsexponentially faster than classical computers, breaking these algorithms.Therefore, they need to be replaced with quantum-secure algorithms,which are too computationally intensivefor both classical and quantum computers to solve.For quantum-secure encryption,you should use Post-quantum Hybrid Public Key Encryption,or Post-quantum HPKE for short.For quantum-secure signing, you should use Post-quantum Hybrid Signatures.These are both post-quantum hybrid constructions, meaning they combine new,post-quantum algorithms with current classical algorithms.Breaking a hybrid construction requires breakingboth the post-quantum algorithm and the classical algorithm,so hybrid constructions give the best security assurancesand are Apple’s recommendation for quantum-secure cryptography.Symmetric-key cryptography includes symmetric-key encryptionand message authentication codes.These algorithms are also based on mathematical problemsthat are hard for classical computers.But these problems are affected by quantum computers quite differentlythan classical public-key algorithms.Quantum computers can only achieve a small, constant factor reduction of the securityof these problems, so they only weaken symmetric-key cryptography.Therefore, symmetric-key algorithms that are classically securecan be made quantum-secure by doubling their key size.Upgrade your 128-bit key ciphers to use 256-bit keys instead.For example, move from AES-128 to AES-256.To tie back to the quantum attacks I discussed,the highest priority in the migration to quantum-secure cryptographyis to defend against harvest now, decrypt later attacks.This is because protocols that send encrypted data in transitcould be getting their data harvested right now.To defend against this,you need to migrate to use quantum- secure encryption for data in transit.This is especially important if your protocol handles sensitive user data.In fact, protecting against this attack is so importantthat Apple has already done this for iMessage.iMessage protects sensitive user conversations sent over the network.To get ahead of quantum attacks,in iOS 17.4, Apple launched iMessage PQ3,which is the state of the art in quantum- secure messaging at scale.This rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground upto provide quantum-secure hybrid encryption for initial key establishmentand ongoing rekeying in conversations.Read the Apple Security Blog for more details about the motivationand design of iMessage PQ3.iMessage PQ3 is a huge advance in quantum-secure messaging at scale,but it is only the tip of the iceberg for protecting network data.Most network data, including all HTTPS traffic,is protected with TLS.I’ll talk about how to defend that data from quantum attacksby upgrading to quantum-secure TLS.TLS 1.3 has a quantum-secure encryption upgradeto protect network data from harvest now, decrypt later attacks.This upgrade uses a quantum-secure key exchangeand has been enabled through standardization effortsby the National Institute of Standards and Technologyand the Internet Engineering Task Force.Quantum-secure encryption in TLShas already been adopted by major service providers.It’s ready for you to use and is straightforward to enable.Starting in iOS 26, quantum-secure encryption in TLSis enabled by default on Apple operating systems,for the recommended networking APIs, URLSession, and Network.framework.Note that just like classical TLS,this protects communication between the clientand the TLS terminating server.You should migrate away from legacy Networking APIs,such as Secure Transport, as these will not support quantum-secure TLS.Custom networking stacks can be more challenging to upgrade.This is a great opportunity to migrate to URLSession,or to back your networking stack with Network.framework.In order to have quantum-secure encryption in TLSworking between devices and your servers,you also need to enable it on the server side.The majority of developers use a content or website hosting provider.Most of these already have support for quantum-secure encryption in TLS.It may be enabled by default,or you can easily enable it with a configuration change.When deploying your own servers, there is a bit more work involved,as you need to explicitly upgrade your TLS libraries and configuration.To learn more, read the documentation for how to prepare your networkfor quantum-secure encryption in TLS.You might be using some system services,which encrypt data from devices to Apple servers.Apple is leading by example, so in iOS 26,these system services will have quantum-secure encryption in TLSenabled on the client side and rolling out on the server side.CloudKit stores your app’s data in iCloud and synchronizes it across devicesand on the web.Apple Push Notifications allow your appto deliver timely and relevant content to your users.And iCloud Private Relay protects DNSand any unencrypted HTTP traffic in your app.And these system services are all enabling quantum-secure encryption in TLS.Apple built-in apps that handle sensitive user data,such as Safari, Weather, and Maps,are also rolling out support for quantum-secure encryption in TLS.And now your app should as well.For most developers, using quantum-secure encryption in TLSis sufficient to protect from harvest now, decrypt later attacks.However, TLS isn’t the only way to protect data in transit.You may have custom cryptography protocols,where you’re using cryptography APIs directly to protect data.If so, you need to migrate to use quantum-secure cryptography APIs instead.To do this, you first need to inventory your current use of cryptography.You need to identify where your protocols use quantum-impacted cryptography,such as encrypted data in transit and signatures.Plan for how to update these protocols to use quantum-secure cryptography instead.Then, use CryptoKit to implement these updates,thanks to the new quantum secure APIs.CryptoKit is a Swift framework available on all Apple platformswith APIs for cryptography algorithms.In iOS 26, CryptoKit has new quantum-secure APIswhich are performant, easy to use, and secure.They provide additional protection against timing and side-channel attacksby enforcing hardware-isolated execution with Secure Enclave.They also have correctness guarantees,as the core implementations are formally verified,meaning they have been proven to be functionally equivalentto standardized specifications.To show how to use the new CryptoKit APIs, I’ll go through an example: Climbing app,which uses a custom cryptography protocol to protect app data in transit.Say you’re making an app that has access to a user’s health data,geolocation tracks, and photos taken on climbing trips.You want to provide end-to-end encryption of this data to the user’s other devices.This is sensitive information,that you want to keep private from the server and from attackers.To achieve this, you create a custom protocolthat encrypts the data to the user’s other devicesand relays the encrypted data through the server.Having quantum-secure TLS is not sufficient here,as TLS protects communication between the client and the TLS terminating server,and in this example, you don’t want to reveal the user data to the server.Any app which encrypts data in transit, like this example Climbing app,needs to use quantum-secure encryptionto protect against harvest now, decrypt later attacks.Starting in iOS 26, CryptoKit supports a quantum-secure encryption APIbased on Post-quantum Hybrid Public Key Encryption,or Post-quantum HPKE for short.This is perfect for your example Climbing app to migrate to,to protect your sensitive user data against quantum attacks.I’ll go through a code sample to demonstrate how you can use this new API.The sender and receiverboth define the Post-quantum HPKE ciphersuite from X-Wing.I’ll go into more details about X-Wing after the sample code demo.On the recipient side, you make an X-Wing key pair.If your app already uses classical HPKE with CryptoKit,migrating to Post-quantum HPKEis just a change of cyphersuite and key typeSo the only parts specific to the quantum-secure HPKE APIare these first few lines.The recipient shares their public key.You then create the sender with the recipient’s public key,and create the recipient with the sender’s encapsulated key.The sender creates a ciphertext by encrypting the sensitive user data,such as health data, geolocation tracks, or photos,along with authenticated metadata.It sends it to the recipient.The recipient decrypts the ciphertext by opening italong with the same authenticated metadata.Now, the user’s climbing trip data has been sent from the senderto the recipient device with quantum-secure end-to-end encryption.As I went over in the sample code,you should use Post-quantum HPKE for quantum-secure encryption.This establishes the HPKE shared key using the X-Wing Key Encapsulation Mechanismor KEM for short.Post-quantum HPKE and X-Wing are post-quantum hybrid constructions,meaning they combine post-quantum and classical algorithmsto get the security guarantees of both.ML-KEM is the post-quantum building block for X-Wing KEM,as well as other post-quantum KEMs.ML-KEM has a larger encryption size overhead than its classical counterparts.But it is performant with comparable or better performancethan its classical counterparts.CryptoKit uses a formally verified implementation of ML-KEM,which has been proven to be functionally equivalentto the FIPS 203 standardized specification.It also has Secure Enclave support,meaning you can enforce hardware-isolated execution for ML-KEM operations.We discussed how you should encrypt data using Post-quantum HPKE,which is a high-level API available in CryptoKit.If you need to implement your own cryptographic protocols,such as to support a protocol specification,CryptoKit has low-level quantum-secure APIs available as well.Post-quantum HPKE uses X-Wing for key encapsulation,which uses ML-KEM as its post-quantum building block.CryptoKit now supports all of these as encryption APIs.Similarly, quantum-secure signatures use ML-DSAas their post-quantum building block.CryptoKit now also supports ML-DSA as a signature API.Like ML-KEM, the ML-DSA implementation has Secure Enclave support.The ML-DSA API can be used to build post-quantum hybrid signaturesat the application code level.The CryptoKit APIs run client-side, on-device.Some protocols require cryptographic interoperabilitybetween the client and server.One of the easiest ways to support this is to use Swift Crypto on the server.Swift Crypto is a Swift librarythat provides API compatibility with CryptoKit for servers,to ensure seamless development.This includes server compatibilityfor all the quantum-secure APIs that CryptoKit supports in iOS 26.Note that because these quantum-secure APIsare implementations of standardized protocols,you can use any standards-compatible library on the server side.With these new quantum-secure APIs in CryptoKit and Swift Crypto,you now have the tools to protect your app from quantum attacksby migrating to quantum-secure cryptography.Check out the sample code in the video resourcesfor more examples of how to use these new APIs.Now you know how to protect your app’s data against quantum attacks.First and foremost, make sure your network data is protectedwith quantum-secure encryption in TLS.This is easy, especially if you use the recommended networking APIs,which have it enabled by default.Update your server configuration to enable it on the server side.For custom cryptography protocols, use the new quantum-secure CryptoKit APIs.Use post-quantum HPKE for encrypting data,like in the example Climbing app.Quantum attacks aren’t a distant possibility.They are relevant now, and we all need to get ahead of themby moving to quantum-secure cryptography.So as climbers say, send it.

0:00 -IntroductionThe rise of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cryptographic algorithms, which can be easily broken by quantum attacks, compromising the security of sensitive user data stored in applications. Get ahead of this risk by transitioning to quantum-secure cryptography.

Learn how to protect network data using quantum-secure encryption in TLS and how to safeguard custom protocols using new quantum-secure APIs in CryptoKit.1:18 -Quantum attacksCryptography is fundamental to securing user data across various workflows, utilizing TLS for protection. However, this security is at risk from quantum attacks. 

Quantum computers pose two main threats: "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks and active quantum attacks. In the former, attackers can intercept and store encrypted data now and decrypt it in the future with quantum computing, breaking confidentiality. This passive attack affects encrypted data, especially data in transit, such as data sent by apps to servers or data synced across devices.

Active quantum attacks, though not yet feasible, involve attackers using quantum computers to break cryptographic signatures, enabling them to impersonate users and forge authentication. These attacks impact apps that perform user and data authentication. Experts agree that sufficiently powerful quantum computers are imminent, necessitating immediate action to mitigate these threats.4:49 -Quantum-secure cryptographyQuantum attacks pose a significant risk to current cryptographic systems, and so the cryptography community  developed quantum-secure algorithms, which are ready for adoption today. 

Classical public-key cryptography, such as RSA and discrete log-on elliptic curves, can be completely broken by quantum computers. You need to replace these algorithms with post-quantum hybrid constructions, which combine new post-quantum algorithms with current classical ones.

Symmetric-key cryptography, which includes symmetric-key encryption and message authentication codes, is weakened by quantum computers. You can make these algorithms quantum-secure by doubling the key size.

The highest priority is to migrate to quantum-secure encryption for data in transit to defend against "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks. Apple has already taken this step by implementing iMessage PQ3 in iOS 17.4, providing quantum-secure hybrid encryption for iMessage conversations.8:56 -Protecting network dataiMessage PQ3 represents a significant stride in quantum-secure messaging, but the broader protection of network data hinges on upgrading to quantum-secure TLS. TLS 1.3 uses a quantum-secure key exchange. This upgrade has already been adopted by major service providers and is enabled by default starting in iOS 26 for the recommended networking APIs 'URLSession' and 'Network.framework'. These quantum-secure networking APIs safeguard against "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.

You need to migrate away from legacy networking APIs and enable quantum-secure TLS on both client and server sides.12:08 -Protecting custom protocolsTo protect data from future quantum attacks, migrate to quantum-secure cryptography. For custom cryptography protocols, this involves inventorying current use, planning updates, and implementing these changes using CryptoKit, a Swift framework available on all Apple platforms. 

In iOS 26, CryptoKit provides a new high-level quantum-secure encryption API that is performant and easy-to-use. This API is based on post-quantum hybrid public key encryption (HPKE) and has correctness guarantees because it's formally verified. Secure Enclave ensures hardware-isolated execution to enhance protection against timing and side-channel attacks. 

CryptoKit also has low-level quantum-secure APIs available. For key encapsulation, post-quantum HPKE uses XWing, which uses ML-KEM as its post-quantum building block. For quantum-secure signatures, ML-DSA is the post-quantum building block. Both of these implementations also have Secure Enclave support.

Apps that encrypt data in transit, such as those handling sensitive user information like health or geolocation data, need to use post-quantum HPKE to establish quantum-secure end-to-end encryption. Some protocols require cryptographic interoperability between the client and server, for which Swift Crypto provides a seamless development experience. The Swift Crypto library provides API compatibility with CryptoKit for servers and ensures compatibility for all the quantum-secure APIs that CryptoKit supports in iOS 26.

1:18 -Quantum attacks

Cryptography is fundamental to securing user data across various workflows, utilizing TLS for protection. However, this security is at risk from quantum attacks. 

Quantum computers pose two main threats: "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks and active quantum attacks. In the former, attackers can intercept and store encrypted data now and decrypt it in the future with quantum computing, breaking confidentiality. This passive attack affects encrypted data, especially data in transit, such as data sent by apps to servers or data synced across devices.

Active quantum attacks, though not yet feasible, involve attackers using quantum computers to break cryptographic signatures, enabling them to impersonate users and forge authentication. These attacks impact apps that perform user and data authentication. Experts agree that sufficiently powerful quantum computers are imminent, necessitating immediate action to mitigate these threats.

4:49 -Quantum-secure cryptography

Quantum attacks pose a significant risk to current cryptographic systems, and so the cryptography community  developed quantum-secure algorithms, which are ready for adoption today. 

Classical public-key cryptography, such as RSA and discrete log-on elliptic curves, can be completely broken by quantum computers. You need to replace these algorithms with post-quantum hybrid constructions, which combine new post-quantum algorithms with current classical ones.

Symmetric-key cryptography, which includes symmetric-key encryption and message authentication codes, is weakened by quantum computers. You can make these algorithms quantum-secure by doubling the key size.

The highest priority is to migrate to quantum-secure encryption for data in transit to defend against "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks. Apple has already taken this step by implementing iMessage PQ3 in iOS 17.4, providing quantum-secure hybrid encryption for iMessage conversations.

8:56 -Protecting network data

iMessage PQ3 represents a significant stride in quantum-secure messaging, but the broader protection of network data hinges on upgrading to quantum-secure TLS. TLS 1.3 uses a quantum-secure key exchange. This upgrade has already been adopted by major service providers and is enabled by default starting in iOS 26 for the recommended networking APIs 'URLSession' and 'Network.framework'. These quantum-secure networking APIs safeguard against "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.
