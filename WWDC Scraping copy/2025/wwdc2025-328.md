Implement App Store Offers

Search this video…Hi, and welcome to What’s New in App Store ConnectI'm Chinedu, from App Store Connect Engineering.In this session, I’ll show you some great new featuresthat make it easier for people to discover your apps,and new ways to tell people that your apps meet their needs.And Hi, I’m Michael, also from App Store Connect Engineeringand I’ll be taking you through some of the new featureswe’ve added in App Store Connect with you in mind.In this session, we have a number of exciting improvements to share with youfor App Store Connect on the web,the App Store Connect app for iPhone and iPad,and we’re bringing even more features to the App Store Connect API.First, I’ll share some improvementsthat we've made to the experience of managing your appand getting it ready for distribution on the App Store.And Chinedu will walk you through the features that make it easierfor people to discover your app,with tags, custom product pages, and non-subscription offer codes,including an all new way for you to inform peoplethat your app is right for them.Finally, we’ll share a few more exciting new featuresand where to find out more about them.So lets move over to managing your app!Everyday, developers like you managehundreds of thousands of builds in App Store Connect for testingand publishing to the App Store.It all starts with the upload process,and it’s important to understandthe status of your build as it gets delivered,so that you know when it’s finished processingor if you encounter any issues along the way that you need to address.You’ve always been able to upload builds using Xcodeand additionally many of you choose to use Transporterto upload your builds to App Store Connect.Starting later this year,you’ll now also be able to use the App Store Connect API to upload your buildsoffering new flexibility for integrating your custom workflows.However you choose to upload your app to App Store Connectyou get an email, letting you know when your build has completed processing,or when we’ve encountered an issue that needs your attention.And now to give you and your team better visibility,we’re enhancing the way build uploads are displayed in App Store Connect.Build uploads in App Store Connect provides a complete view of your appdeliveries that are in progress for a given app,visible by your team members.Even more importantly, the builds you deliver are now includedand retained in App Store Connect,even if your build wasn’t accepted due to an errorencountered during the process.And you and your team have access to any information on warnings or errorsthat your delivery may have encountered.In the TestFlight section in App Store Connect,where you typically view your builds,you’ll see an entirely new Build Uploads sectionfor your builds that are in progress.The status will change as you progress through the build delivery process,from the moment your build delivery is createdto when your build is processing.You may notice that in the Builds Uploads sectionI have two builds with the same version and build number,my most recent version which is uploaded and ready for testingand the previous delivery that failed.This means that going forward you’ll be able to reuse a build numbershould your app delivery fail with an error.If you or your team want to know more details about the failed delivery,you can click in for the full message and details.To reiterate, you’ll now be able to upload your buildsusing the App Store Connect API.With our new Webhooks you can also receive realtime notificationsfor the status changes during the app delivery process.Automate your development process with the App Store Connect APIwill go over both of these features in depthso be sure to check that out to learn more.When it comes to your builds, you might be looking for additional waysto keep your app as small as possible.Another great feature we’re introducingthis year to help you manage your build sizeare Apple-Hosted Background Assets.Apple-Hosted Background Assets provides an enhanced way to distributeassets of up to 200GB for your app,they’re hosted by Apple, and they work across Mac, iPhone and iPad,Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.You’ll be able to update Apple-Hosted Background Assets outside of your app,allowing you to introduce new content exactly when you want.To learn more about this exciting new feature,be sure to check out Discover Apple-Hosted Background Assetsfor more in-depth information.And that’s some improvements for managing your builds.Let’s move on to reviewing feedback.Getting feedback from your testers before you launch is critical,and TestFlight makes it easy for testers to give feedback on your apps,games, and App Clips across Apple platforms before you publish.Testers can submit feedback on your app directly through TestFlightor the share sheet on iOS.They include text describing the feedbackand optionally, screenshots to help further illustrate their experience.You also get valuable testing data in the form of crash logs,delivered from your testers devices.You’ll typically browse this feedback in App Store Connector take crash logs and open them directly inside Xcode for further investigation.Getting this feedback quickly is an important way to stay connectedwith your testing communityand improve the overall quality of your apps and games.And now, we’re bringing feedback from TestFlightand notifications to the App Store Connect app on iPhone and iPad.With Feedback and notifications,it allows you to get realtime feedback from your testersdirectly in the App Store Connect app.If you’re worried about becoming overwhelmed with feedback,our digest feature scales your notifications,allowing you to get timely feedback without causing too many interruptions.Feedback can be reviewed at a glanceand more importantly, shared with your team,right from your device, wherever you are.This allows you to take quick actionand identify issues that need your attention.Let’s see how this works.When a tester has reported some feedbackyou’ll get a notification through the App Store Connect app.From that notification you can quickly review the included detailsincluding screenshots and description the tester provided with their feedback.If you scroll down you’ll find more informationabout the testers specific configuration when the feedback was submitted.And while you’re in the app you can share this feedbackwith anyone on your developer teamwhere they can also open the feedback using App Store Connect on the webor the app.You have access to more than just the feedback you’ve been notified about.You can browse and filter on all the screenshot feedbacksubmitted by any testers.Crash feedback and logs work much the same way.You’ll be able to glance at details about the crash encountered,which is handy when you want to reference this informationin combination with debugging in Xcode.Finally, you can customize to receive notificationsfor the App Store Connect app to only provide notificationsfor Screenshots or Crash feedback.Along with these new features for the App Store Connect app,we’re adding support for Webhooks for use with the App Store Connect APIfor both screenshot and crash feedback from TestFlightproviding more opportunities for automation.We’re also introducing TestFlight feedback APIsfor you to access all the same information.Again, to learn about all these exciting new features,be sure to check out Automate your development processwith the App Store Connect API.The new improvements that we’ve made to managing builds and reviewing feedbackwill make it even easier to manage your app in App Store Connect.Now I am going to hand it over to Chineduto tell you more about the changes to make it easier to get your app discovered.Thanks Michael.People discover your apps on the App Store in a range of ways.Either by searching your app’s keywords, through editorial pieces,or even through app categories.This year, we’re introducing a number of big changes to make your appseven more discoverable, one of which is App Store Tags.Your app’s metadata, its description, category, even screenshotshold very useful information about your app that’s often buried.To help uncover some of that information we’re building on app categoriesand generating tags that better highlight specific features and functionalitieswhich help people really zoom-in on what they are looking for.These App Store Tags are generated by our large language modelsusing a range of data sources, including your app’s metadata.The tags are all human reviewedso you can be confident of the quality of the tagsthat can be applied to your apps.Tapping on a tag, takes people to a dedicated viewwith a personalised and curated collection of apps or gamesthat share similar features or functionalities.We also surface these tags at key areas in the app storeto drive discoverability across our catalogue.For example, tags appear along-side app categories on the search pageand with your app in search results.Now, whilst we are generating and assigning these tags to your apps,you still have control over which ones are associated with your app.You can view your tags on the App information page in App Store Connect.And you can tailor the tags associated with your app by clicking editand changing the selected tags.Deselecting a tag removes it’s association with your app across the app storeso those tags won’t show up on your app’s product page,and your app won’t show up in the tag rooms for the those tags.In addition to tags, we’ve made improvementsto another way people discover your apps; custom product pages.As a refresher, custom product pages are a handy way of showcasingdistinct use-cases in your app.This year, we are introducing keywords for custom product pagesallowing them to now be surfaced in search resultsThis enables you to really tailor how your app appears in search resultsto better match a person’s query.Whenever your app shows up in search resultsfor the keywords you’ve assigned,your custom product page shows in place of your default product page.To set this up, simply assign any keyword, or set of keywordsfrom your latest app store versionto your custom product page; here’s how.Navigate to custom product pages,say you want to make the “workouttracking” custom product pagediscoverable in search, simply click into itand select the keyword, or words, you want to assign.You can also customise your selection for each language.Once you’re done, and as long as you’re just assigning keywords,you can make this live without needing to submit for review.Assigning keywords to your custom product pageslets you show the most relevant representation of your appin search results.So it’s recommended that you make your keyword selections uniquefor each of your custom product pages,so that the right custom product page is shown.You can also view search traffic per custom product page in app analytics.A great way to engage with your customersand drive discoverability outside of the app store, is with offer codes.Offer codes have been very popular with subscriptions, and now,we’re expanding them to consumables, non-consumablesand non-renewing subscriptions.You can now generate free and discount offer codesfor all types of In-App Purchases and subscriptions.You can have up to 10 active offers per In-App Purchase at a time,and you can create codes in batches,up to a maximum of 1 million offer codes per app per quarter,across both subscriptions and In-App Purchases.You can also define the types of customersthat can redeem your In-App Purchase offers.You can set redemption eligibility based on whether:the customer has never spent in your app,if they’ve spent, but not in the last 30 days,or if they’ve spent in the last 30 days.To enable you to fine tune your user-experienceand validate your app and server logicyou can now generate offer codesin the sandbox testing environmentfor both In-App Purchases and subscriptions!You can generate up to ten thousand codes per app per quarterand these codes can be redeemed in-appor in Sandbox Account Settings on iPhone and iPad.There’s also no limit on how many codes a single Sandbox Apple Account can redeem.Now to set up some offer codes!You’ll start by creating an offer campaign.We’ve added a new creation process within the In-App Purchases details page.When setting up your campaign, you’ll specify the eligibility criteria.So you can restrict this offer to people that have never purchased in your app,those that have purchased in the last 30 daysand/or those that have purchased, but not in the last 30 days.Once you have your campaign, you can generate your codes.The same one-time and custom code types,that are available for subscription offers,are also available for In-App Purchases.If you need a refresher on offer code typestake a look at Xiaolan and Ricky’sImplement App Store Offers session from last year.And for testing, you have the sandbox codes.Once you have your codes, you can distribute themthrough a deep-link, QR code, or by having customers enter them in your app.All of these options are fully supported by the App Store’s redemption flow,and you can support in-app redemption with StoreKit.So once a person redeems a code,there’s nothing else for you to do; we’ll take it from there.Once the App Store redemption flow is complete,the person doesn’t already have your app installed,it’ll be installed automatically;just make sure you recognise the transaction with StoreKitand grant access right away.And, to help you understand the sales and trendsof each of your offer code campaigns,you can view reports in App Store Connect.Once people have discovered your app, you’ll want to show themthat others are having a great experience with your app,and that you support features and capabilities that make your app safe,and easy to use.To make it easier for people to get an idea of the general sentimentsbehind the customer reviews your app has received,we are generating Review Summaries.These summaries are generated using our large language models,and combine key information and highlightsfrom individual user reviews into a short paragraph.They are generated for apps and games,with enough customer reviews to provide a summary.And they’re refreshed regularly.If your app has a review summary,in App Store Connect: you can view the summary that’s shownin your app’s product page and when it was last generated.And if the summary is not quite right, you can let us know by reporting a concern.Another very important thing people checkbefore downloading an app, is the app’s Age rating.We are making changes to help parents better understand your app’s suitabilityfor their young children, pre-teens, and teenagers.We’re also giving you more waysto communicate your app’s suitability for different age groups.We now have 5 age rating thresholds, three of which are new.This offers more granularity to better cater a wide rangeof people’s needs and maturity.In certain regions, the ratings are differentto better reflect that region’s requirements.We use existing age ratings responsesto automatically calculate new age ratings.If your app has controls which can limit content in your app,for example through parental controls or age assurance, you can declare them.You can also indicate if your app has capabilities or featuresthat could bring age-inappropriate content to your app.And this year, there are new capabilities to indicate, like messaging and chat,user-generated content, and advertising.You may need to assign a higher age rating than the one that’s calculated,for example this could be to align with your app’s policy.You can assign a higher age rating with a simple override.On your app’s product page, we’ll showthe age rating based on the person’s country or region.And, people can tap the age ratingto view your declared in-app controls and capabilitiesalong with responses to the other age rating questions.Now, to configure age ratings!We’ve redesigned the developer experience.You can now learn about each category in a new learn more section.Clicking on the cardsopens a modal with descriptions and guidance on each category.Once you’ve reviewed the guidelines and ready to get started,click “Set Up Age Ratings”.We’ve included descriptions and helpful examples with each questionmaking it easier to respond correctly.We’ve added new questions which you’ll useto declare your in-app controlsand indicate your app’s capabilities.You’ll go through the questionnaire, and when you’re done,we’ll calculate your app’s age ratings for all regions,including those with more specific guidelines.We’ll present the calculated ratingand say your app’s policy requires users to be 16 or olderyou can override the calculated age rating and assign a higher one.If you have a dedicated page with more information on your app’s age suitability,you can add the url.Once you’re done, click saveand you’ll get a summary view of your app’s age ratingacross all countries and regions it’s distributed in.You can click into any of the cardsto view the countries and regions that are assigned that rating.The new age ratings are also available to viewin the App Store Connect app on iPhone and iPad.These changes impact all apps.And age ratings for your apps will be automatically calculatedusing your existing responses.So review your new age ratings and answer the new questionsto ensure everything is accurate.Another thing people want to know before downloading an app,is that they can use the app in the ways that work best, for them.This often means checkingthat the app supports the accessibility features that they need.To make it easier for you to tell people your app supports accessibility features,like Larger Text and VoiceOver,we are introducing, Accessibility Nutrition Labels.These Accessibility Nutrition Labelsare displayed in a new section on your app’s product pageand give people confidence that your app supports their needs.You declare accessibility support by device independently,allowing you to tailor your accessibility nutrition labelsto match the levels of support in each of the devices your app is available on.To help you accurately determine which features you support,for example understanding the difference between voice over and voice control,we’ve created a set of detailed guidance on determining support.We also have the Evaluating your app for Accessibility Nutrition Labels sessionto help you assess your apps.To set up an accessibility nutrition label,click get startedand select the device you want to declare accessibility support for.You can select one or more deviceson the platforms your app has versions for.If you select multiple devices,we’ll create drafts for each device for you to fill in one at a time.Select one device, and you continue onand indicate the specific supported features.We’ve included brief descriptions under each featureto help you make sure your selection is accurate.On the last step, we show you the accessibility nutrition labelas it’ll be displayed on your app’s product page.All labels are initially saved as draftsso you can make as many edits as you needto get your declaration as accurate as possible.When you're ready, you can publish your accessibility nutrition labels.If you have multiple device declarations,you can publish them together or individually.Accessibility support is an ongoing activityand with future app versions, you may support even more features.So, you can always edit your accessibility nutrition labels,even after it's been published.You may also have a websitewith information about your app’s accessibility support,you can add the urland it’ll be shown on your app’s product page.These are just some of the amazing featuresand improvements we’ve made this year.We have even more updates and enhancements we’d like to share,so back to Michael to tell you all about them.Thanks Chinedu!Those are some really incredible features coming to App Store Connect this yearand we can’t wait for you to try out some of this new functionality yourself.We showed you some new ways to manage your apps in App Store Connectand some incredible new featuresto help more people discover your app on the App Store.We also showed you some features to help inform your usersif your app is right for them,including the introduction of our all new Accessibility Nutrition Labels.In addition to the features we just discussedwe have a number of additional updates and enhancementsacross the developer and App Store ecosystem, including: App Analytics.We’re adding over 100 new metrics in App Analytics in App Store Connectincluding brand new subscriptions and monetization datato help you grow your business on the App Store.You’ll be able to explore all of this new data in a redesigned experience,making it easier to navigate, filter data, and analyze your app’s performance.You can learn about all these new exciting changesin Optimize your monetization with App Analytics,and we’ve made some incredible new improvements to Game Centerstarting off with an all new games appto boost discoverability, engagement, and excitement of your games.Game Center is also introducing new activities and challengesunlocking powerful new multiplayer and social experiences.While not exclusive to Game Center, we’ve also made some improvementsto installing and testing large content on Mac with your games in mind.You’ll find out about many of these new featuresand more in the Engage players with the Apple Games app session.Finally we’re making some refinementsto the App Review submission process,including new review submission items,like the all new Apple-Hosted Background Assetsand Game Center types that can be submitted independentlyof an app version submission.You’ll be able to group items into draft submissionsallowing you to have them reviewed together.This is incredibly useful for creating submissionsthat benefit from multiple item types,like In App Events and Custom Product Pages.The updated user interface and submission flowwill also make it easier to perform these actionsand get your content submitted, reviewed, and onto the App Store.Should you have trouble using any of the featuresin App Store Connect or TestFlight,please know that we’re here to help!You can reach out to Apple

In this session, we have a number of exciting improvements to share with youfor App Store Connect on the web,the App Store Connect app for iPhone and iPad,and we’re bringing even more features to the App Store Connect API.First, I’ll share some improvementsthat we've made to the experience of managing your appand getting it ready for distribution on the App Store.And Chinedu will walk you through the features that make it easierfor people to discover your app,with tags, custom product pages, and non-subscription offer codes,including an all new way for you to inform peoplethat your app is right for them.Finally, we’ll share a few more exciting new featuresand where to find out more about them.So lets move over to managing your app!Everyday, developers like you managehundreds of thousands of builds in App Store Connect for testingand publishing to the App Store.It all starts with the upload process,and it’s important to understandthe status of your build as it gets delivered,so that you know when it’s finished processingor if you encounter any issues along the way that you need to address.You’ve always been able to upload builds using Xcodeand additionally many of you choose to use Transporterto upload your builds to App Store Connect.

Starting later this year,you’ll now also be able to use the App Store Connect API to upload your buildsoffering new flexibility for integrating your custom workflows.

However you choose to upload your app to App Store Connectyou get an email, letting you know when your build has completed processing,or when we’ve encountered an issue that needs your attention.

And now to give you and your team better visibility,we’re enhancing the way build uploads are displayed in App Store Connect.

Build uploads in App Store Connect provides a complete view of your appdeliveries that are in progress for a given app,visible by your team members.

Even more importantly, the builds you deliver are now includedand retained in App Store Connect,even if your build wasn’t accepted due to an errorencountered during the process.And you and your team have access to any information on warnings or errorsthat your delivery may have encountered.In the TestFlight section in App Store Connect,where you typically view your builds,you’ll see an entirely new Build Uploads sectionfor your builds that are in progress.The status will change as you progress through the build delivery process,from the moment your build delivery is createdto when your build is processing.

You may notice that in the Builds Uploads sectionI have two builds with the same version and build number,my most recent version which is uploaded and ready for testingand the previous delivery that failed.This means that going forward you’ll be able to reuse a build numbershould your app delivery fail with an error.

If you or your team want to know more details about the failed delivery,you can click in for the full message and details.

To reiterate, you’ll now be able to upload your buildsusing the App Store Connect API.With our new Webhooks you can also receive realtime notificationsfor the status changes during the app delivery process.

Automate your development process with the App Store Connect APIwill go over both of these features in depthso be sure to check that out to learn more.When it comes to your builds, you might be looking for additional waysto keep your app as small as possible.Another great feature we’re introducingthis year to help you manage your build sizeare Apple-Hosted Background Assets.Apple-Hosted Background Assets provides an enhanced way to distributeassets of up to 200GB for your app,they’re hosted by Apple, and they work across Mac, iPhone and iPad,Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.You’ll be able to update Apple-Hosted Background Assets outside of your app,allowing you to introduce new content exactly when you want.To learn more about this exciting new feature,be sure to check out Discover Apple-Hosted Background Assetsfor more in-depth information.And that’s some improvements for managing your builds.Let’s move on to reviewing feedback.Getting feedback from your testers before you launch is critical,and TestFlight makes it easy for testers to give feedback on your apps,games, and App Clips across Apple platforms before you publish.

Testers can submit feedback on your app directly through TestFlightor the share sheet on iOS.

They include text describing the feedbackand optionally, screenshots to help further illustrate their experience.You also get valuable testing data in the form of crash logs,delivered from your testers devices.You’ll typically browse this feedback in App Store Connector take crash logs and open them directly inside Xcode for further investigation.Getting this feedback quickly is an important way to stay connectedwith your testing communityand improve the overall quality of your apps and games.

And while you’re in the app you can share this feedbackwith anyone on your developer teamwhere they can also open the feedback using App Store Connect on the webor the app.

You have access to more than just the feedback you’ve been notified about.You can browse and filter on all the screenshot feedbacksubmitted by any testers.

Crash feedback and logs work much the same way.You’ll be able to glance at details about the crash encountered,which is handy when you want to reference this informationin combination with debugging in Xcode.

Finally, you can customize to receive notificationsfor the App Store Connect app to only provide notificationsfor Screenshots or Crash feedback.

Along with these new features for the App Store Connect app,we’re adding support for Webhooks for use with the App Store Connect APIfor both screenshot and crash feedback from TestFlightproviding more opportunities for automation.

We’re also introducing TestFlight feedback APIsfor you to access all the same information.

Again, to learn about all these exciting new features,be sure to check out Automate your development processwith the App Store Connect API.The new improvements that we’ve made to managing builds and reviewing feedbackwill make it even easier to manage your app in App Store Connect.Now I am going to hand it over to Chineduto tell you more about the changes to make it easier to get your app discovered.Thanks Michael.People discover your apps on the App Store in a range of ways.Either by searching your app’s keywords, through editorial pieces,or even through app categories.

Offer codes have been very popular with subscriptions, and now,we’re expanding them to consumables, non-consumablesand non-renewing subscriptions.You can now generate free and discount offer codesfor all types of In-App Purchases and subscriptions.

You can have up to 10 active offers per In-App Purchase at a time,and you can create codes in batches,up to a maximum of 1 million offer codes per app per quarter,across both subscriptions and In-App Purchases.You can also define the types of customersthat can redeem your In-App Purchase offers.You can set redemption eligibility based on whether:the customer has never spent in your app,if they’ve spent, but not in the last 30 days,or if they’ve spent in the last 30 days.To enable you to fine tune your user-experienceand validate your app and server logicyou can now generate offer codesin the sandbox testing environmentfor both In-App Purchases and subscriptions!You can generate up to ten thousand codes per app per quarterand these codes can be redeemed in-appor in Sandbox Account Settings on iPhone and iPad.There’s also no limit on how many codes a single Sandbox Apple Account can redeem.Now to set up some offer codes!You’ll start by creating an offer campaign.

The same one-time and custom code types,that are available for subscription offers,are also available for In-App Purchases.

If you need a refresher on offer code typestake a look at Xiaolan and Ricky’sImplement App Store Offers session from last year.And for testing, you have the sandbox codes.

Once you have your codes, you can distribute themthrough a deep-link, QR code, or by having customers enter them in your app.

All of these options are fully supported by the App Store’s redemption flow,and you can support in-app redemption with StoreKit.

So once a person redeems a code,there’s nothing else for you to do; we’ll take it from there.

Once the App Store redemption flow is complete,the person doesn’t already have your app installed,it’ll be installed automatically;just make sure you recognise the transaction with StoreKitand grant access right away.And, to help you understand the sales and trendsof each of your offer code campaigns,you can view reports in App Store Connect.

Once people have discovered your app, you’ll want to show themthat others are having a great experience with your app,and that you support features and capabilities that make your app safe,and easy to use.To make it easier for people to get an idea of the general sentimentsbehind the customer reviews your app has received,we are generating Review Summaries.

These summaries are generated using our large language models,and combine key information and highlightsfrom individual user reviews into a short paragraph.They are generated for apps and games,with enough customer reviews to provide a summary.And they’re refreshed regularly.If your app has a review summary,in App Store Connect: you can view the summary that’s shownin your app’s product page and when it was last generated.And if the summary is not quite right, you can let us know by reporting a concern.

Another very important thing people checkbefore downloading an app, is the app’s Age rating.We are making changes to help parents better understand your app’s suitabilityfor their young children, pre-teens, and teenagers.

We’re also giving you more waysto communicate your app’s suitability for different age groups.We now have 5 age rating thresholds, three of which are new.

This offers more granularity to better cater a wide rangeof people’s needs and maturity.In certain regions, the ratings are differentto better reflect that region’s requirements.We use existing age ratings responsesto automatically calculate new age ratings.

If your app has controls which can limit content in your app,for example through parental controls or age assurance, you can declare them.

You can also indicate if your app has capabilities or featuresthat could bring age-inappropriate content to your app.And this year, there are new capabilities to indicate, like messaging and chat,user-generated content, and advertising.

You may need to assign a higher age rating than the one that’s calculated,for example this could be to align with your app’s policy.You can assign a higher age rating with a simple override.On your app’s product page, we’ll showthe age rating based on the person’s country or region.And, people can tap the age ratingto view your declared in-app controls and capabilitiesalong with responses to the other age rating questions.Now, to configure age ratings!We’ve redesigned the developer experience.You can now learn about each category in a new learn more section.Clicking on the cardsopens a modal with descriptions and guidance on each category.

Once you’ve reviewed the guidelines and ready to get started,click “Set Up Age Ratings”.

We’ve included descriptions and helpful examples with each questionmaking it easier to respond correctly.

We’ve added new questions which you’ll useto declare your in-app controlsand indicate your app’s capabilities.

You’ll go through the questionnaire, and when you’re done,we’ll calculate your app’s age ratings for all regions,including those with more specific guidelines.

We’ll present the calculated ratingand say your app’s policy requires users to be 16 or olderyou can override the calculated age rating and assign a higher one.If you have a dedicated page with more information on your app’s age suitability,you can add the url.

Once you’re done, click saveand you’ll get a summary view of your app’s age ratingacross all countries and regions it’s distributed in.

You can click into any of the cardsto view the countries and regions that are assigned that rating.

The new age ratings are also available to viewin the App Store Connect app on iPhone and iPad.

These changes impact all apps.And age ratings for your apps will be automatically calculatedusing your existing responses.So review your new age ratings and answer the new questionsto ensure everything is accurate.Another thing people want to know before downloading an app,is that they can use the app in the ways that work best, for them.This often means checkingthat the app supports the accessibility features that they need.To make it easier for you to tell people your app supports accessibility features,like Larger Text and VoiceOver,we are introducing, Accessibility Nutrition Labels.

These Accessibility Nutrition Labelsare displayed in a new section on your app’s product pageand give people confidence that your app supports their needs.You declare accessibility support by device independently,allowing you to tailor your accessibility nutrition labelsto match the levels of support in each of the devices your app is available on.

To help you accurately determine which features you support,for example understanding the difference between voice over and voice control,we’ve created a set of detailed guidance on determining support.

We also have the Evaluating your app for Accessibility Nutrition Labels sessionto help you assess your apps.To set up an accessibility nutrition label,click get startedand select the device you want to declare accessibility support for.

You can select one or more deviceson the platforms your app has versions for.If you select multiple devices,we’ll create drafts for each device for you to fill in one at a time.Select one device, and you continue onand indicate the specific supported features.

We’ve included brief descriptions under each featureto help you make sure your selection is accurate.

On the last step, we show you the accessibility nutrition labelas it’ll be displayed on your app’s product page.

All labels are initially saved as draftsso you can make as many edits as you needto get your declaration as accurate as possible.

When you're ready, you can publish your accessibility nutrition labels.If you have multiple device declarations,you can publish them together or individually.

Accessibility support is an ongoing activityand with future app versions, you may support even more features.So, you can always edit your accessibility nutrition labels,even after it's been published.

You may also have a websitewith information about your app’s accessibility support,you can add the urland it’ll be shown on your app’s product page.
