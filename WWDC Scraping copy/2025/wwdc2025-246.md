Search this video…Hello, my name is Joey Tyson and I’m a privacy engineer at Apple.When you build apps that rely on people’s data,the power of that data makes it essential to integrate privacyinto your development process.At Apple, we believe that privacy is more than just a buzzword.Everyone deserves to have their data handled with care and respect.In this video, I’m excited to review key phases in building an appand share practical ways to infuse them with privacy at every step.First, though, I’ll review what I mean by “privacy”.At a conference in 2010, Steve Jobs described privacyas people knowing what they’re signing up for,in plain language, and repeatedly.In other words, people can understand and trust how you handle their data.There’s alignment between what they expect or intendand what you do in practice.Steve also expressed his optimismthat people can make the right choices for themselves about their dataif you build this understanding.He noted that some people want to share more data than other people do.Everyone brings their particular context to such choices,and it's not for anyone else to assume on their behalf.In fact, one of the best ways to stay consistent with what people intendis simply to ask them.No matter how you write a definition for privacy,three key concepts consistently appear.First, privacy is about people,how they interact with technology, and how it impacts them.More specifically,it involves the impact of processing data about people:what you do with what you know about the people using your app.Finally, in deciding what to do,you need to take into account the context of that information,especially the expectations and preferences of the people it describes.Privacy is about showing respect for that contextwhen you’re entrusted with someone’s data.Knowing information about people can enable you to create exciting,personalized experiences for them.However, if that information is used in waysthey don’t expect or shared in new contexts,it can have significant, tangible impacts on their lives.As people use your app to accomplish their goals,it should work in ways they expect or choose,including how it uses data to fulfill those goals.Tim Cook has shared that Apple’s approach to privacyinvolves collecting as little of your data as possible,then being thoughtful and respectful when it’s in our care.He highlighted that we ask ourselves not simply what can we do,but what should we do in the best interests of our users?This perspective informs Apple's privacy pillars of data minimization,on-device processing, transparency and control,and security protections.Now, I’m going to make this more practical by applying a privacy mindsetin the context of app development.All of Apple’s platforms include many technologiesto help make great privacy a reality in your app.These are just a few of the tool I will share with you in this videoon integrating privacy into your development process.No matter what model you follow in your software development lifecycle,it will likely cover these five simplified phases.planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.I'll go through these stagesand show you opportunities for building great privacy in each one.I will also share tools available on Apple platformsto support your privacy goals, as well as a few privacy requirements.First, I'll talk about planning.This is where you begin to write your app’s privacy story.To deliver the best privacy in your app,the strongest alignment with someone’s intentwhen handling their personal data,privacy should be part of development from the very beginning.As with security or localization,privacy is much more challenging to retrofit later on.At Apple, we begin our planning by defining privacy assurances,high-level statements of what we want peopleto expect from our products when it comes to privacy.These product descriptions not only inform the specific engineering requirementsfor implementing your privacy goals,they can help you communicate those goals to the peoplewho use your app.At Apple, we use the privacy pillars I mentioned beforeto help guide the privacy assurances we craft.To illustrate this process,suppose I’m building an app called Pal Aboutfor finding nearby points of interest and sharing photos of them with friends.Data minimization means using only the data you needto maximize your alignment with people’s expectations.This builds efficiency and trust.In particular, when collecting data for analytics,think carefully about problems you're trying to solveor questions you're trying to answerand ensure your data collection is proportional to those use cases.For my app, one assurance I will defineis that  “We only retain aggregate usage data.”Data minimization also reflects an approach of strong defaults,building experiences that start with the least number of assumptionsabout people’s privacy choices.In my app, I may decide to assure users that “When searching for nearby places,your current location is not stored by default.”I mentioned earlier that privacy involves the context of someone’s information.On-device processing is a key way you can respect that context.Anytime data crosses a boundary from one context to another,such as from the device to a server or between two different apps,think carefully about whether that flow is necessaryand how it affects your users’ privacy.Going back to my Pal About app, I could write:“Suggested meetup locations are only generated locally using on-device data.”Once you’ve planned for strong defaults and maintaining context,set expectations for how data is usedand provide options for customizing the experience.When giving options to share data beyond the defaults,ensure that those choices provide clear value in return.In particular, when building features with AI,let people know when AI is being used and empower them to make decisionsabout relevant data flows,such as whether data is used for training models.For a privacy assurance in my app, I might decide that“Photos you upload are only used to train generative modelsif you opt in to improve intelligence features.”Finally, security protectionscan help maintain limits on your data flows to avoid harm.This means that whenever possible,privacy should be supported by technical controls.That is, systems which maintain privacy natively,even if other parts end up not working as expected.In my example app, I could say, “We cannot read messages to your friendsin transit between devices,” and support that goalwith an architecture using end-to-end encryption.Now, I'll focus on design,constructing how users will actually interact with your product.Great design lets you communicate with people using your appand educate them without it feeling like a chore.If people can trust how an app uses their data,they’re more likely to engage with it and share that data.I’ll now share a few general design principlesfor building that trust.First, set expectations proactively.People should never feel caught off guard by what data an app collectsor how it uses that data.For example, in Apple apps, we show a brief summaryof key privacy aspects on first launch,along with a link to more detailed information.You can also use onboarding flows in your appto help people understand how it uses data.In addition to educating people up front, make state changes clear.That is, ensure people can understand in the moment any changes to data flowsthat might affect their privacy or change their behavior.As an example, we show an animation on iOS to indicate whenever Siri is invoked,along with the system indicator at the top of the screenthat appears whenever the microphone is enabled.Finally, choices about data should be meaningful and contextual.Each option should either make a tangible difference in app behavioror include a clear explanation of impact.Time these choices to appear when they are most relevantand study what level of granularityprovides the right balance for your audience.For example, if Pal About on macOS included a featurefor connecting with streaming media devices,I would not attempt any local network connectionsuntil someone decided to access that feature.This makes it clear why those connections need to happenand why the system shows a prompt to enable them.For more information on designing with privacy,check out the “Human Interface Guidelines” in the Apple Developer Documentation.After planning and designing for privacy, it’s time to write some code.You can use many tools and technologies to implement your privacy goals.In this section, I will highlight just a few examples ofhow you can use such tools when building your app.I’ll start with ways you can streamline privacy choicesin your app's user interface.Accessing device resources, such as your calendar or current location,means sharing sensitive data across different contexts.So Apple’s platforms are designed to share this dataonly when it aligns with a user's intent.Broad access has the most impact on privacy,so requesting it usually triggers an explicit permission prompt,such as this photo library prompt.If someone only wants to share a few photos,allowing access to the entire librarycould reveal far more information than they intend.And that’s why “Limit Access” lets someone chooseonly certain photos instead.But you can create a smoother experienceby using tools for requesting only the data you need.Since people choose what to share via these flows,their interactions signal intent implicitly,and they don’t get additional prompts.With my example app, I want to let people upload photos,but I probably don’t need access to their entire library.Instead, I can use a PhotosPickerto avoid the photo library prompt entirely.Since the system renders the picker out of process,the app only receives the photos the person actually selects,and no permission prompt is shown.You can embed the picker within the UI of your appand customize its appearance,and it even lets users select from their hidden photos.Versions of the picker are also available on other platforms,including macOS and visionOS.Watch the video, “Embed the Photos Picker in your app”from WWDC23, for more info.Apple offers other secure UI elements that streamline data access.Going back to my app,suppose I want to let people easily search for places nearby.Adding a Location Button lets them share their current location with just one tap.The system validates the button was triggered by a user interaction,helping to ensure yet againthat the location sharing aligns with their intent.You can customize the look and feel of this buttonso it better matches your app's UI.The first time someone taps on a Location Button in your app,they will get a prompt confirming their intentand an explanation of what the button does.The location indicator will also be shown at the top of the screenas it would when location is shared through other APIs.After selecting “OK”, however, future taps will not trigger any prompt,and the current location will simply be shared right away.Watch the video “Meet the Location Button” from WWDC21 for more details.These are just two examples of tools for reducingthe cognitive load of privacy UI.Others include: an out-of-process picker for contacts,the UIPasteControl button,and streamlined flows for setting up hardware accessories.Check for options to access only the device data you needbefore using a broader API.Of course, in some cases, permission prompts may still be necessary.To help make them meaningful and contextual,perform actions that trigger themat times when the user would expect such a question to appear.Avoid presenting such choices the first time they open your app,and write purpose strings that clearly explainwhy someone is encountering that prompt.Now, I’ll go over some of the privacy technologiesthat can work behind the scenes as part of client-server interactions.In particular, I'll share a few ways to use server-side resourceswithout exposing sensitive data to the server,then how to reduce the need for identifiable datain addressing some common data collection scenarios.On Apple platforms, Advanced Data Protectionis a feature that lets people enable end-to-end encryptionfor the vast majority of their data stored in iCloud.By adopting CloudKit, you can also enable end-to-end encryptionof data stored by your app in CloudKitwhenever someone enables Advanced Data Protection.This is possible without any changes to your infrastructureor additional management of encryption keys.First, make sure to use encrypted data typesfor all fields in your CloudKit schema.This includes CKAsset fields by default, and for most data types in CloudKit,there is an encrypted variant, such as EncryptedString.Then you can use the encryptedValues APIto retrieve or store data on your CloudKit records.All encryption and decryption operations are abstracted away by this API.Note that CloudKit doesn’t support indexes on encrypted fields,so don’t include them in your predicate or sort descriptorswhen fetching records with CKQuery and CKQueryOperation.Watch the video “What’s new in CloudKit?” from WWDC21 for more information.Another encryption technique we use at Appleis called homomorphic encryption.Instead of computing over raw data,this lets you compute over encrypted payloadsand get the same output when decrypting the result.At no point during computation is the data decrypted.By combining simple compute operations such as addition,homomorphic encryption can enable more advanced technologies,such as Private Information Retrieval.Using PIR, you can look up data from a serverwithout the query or result ever being availableon the server in a decrypted format.With PIR, the device sends an encrypted payload of the queryto the server,then the server uses homomorphic encryptionto compute an encrypted result.Remember, the computation itself is encrypted,so which result matches the query is not available to the serverin cleartext at any point during the lifetime of the request.Finally, the server sends the encrypted resultback to the device for it to decrypt and process locally.In my Pal About app,I could use PIR to get current information about meetup locationsfrom a server without the server being able totrack someone's search history.For some users, knowing what locations they explore in the appcould affect their safety,so the engineering choice of whether I use PIR in my appbecomes an important privacy decision.PIR is already used in features both on Apple platformsand in popular apps from developers just like you.For more details on implementing PIR, check outthe Swift Homomorphic Encryption library and applications on GitHub.Two common scenarios that may at first seem to requireidentifiable data collection are reducing fraud and ad attribution.I’ll share some of the features Apple has builtto help you accomplish your goals in these areaswhile reducing the need to collect data against a user ID or IP address.For anti-fraud,Private Access Tokens can help assure that requests come from legitimate deviceswhile not identifying the people using them.Devices receive anonymous tokens after being validated,and you can verify these tokenswithout needing additional identity information.Watch the video“Replace CAPTCHAs with Private Access Tokens”from WWDC22 for more details.You may also need to prevent fraudulent actions specific to your app,such as trying to redeem a promotion multiple times.DeviceCheck is an API that lets you associate up totwo bits of information with a given devicewithout needing to track device identifiers.These states are maintained by Appleand persist across reinstall or device transfers.Watch the video“Mitigate fraud with App Attest and DeviceCheck”from WWDC21 for more details on how to set and retrieve them.For ad performance,AdAttributionKit is a powerful tool to measure the success of ad campaignswhile maintaining privacy.It lets you attribute app installs and re-engagements to a particular campaignthrough a signed postback signal from the user’s device.AdAttributionKit can also further help in reducing prompts.Calling AdAttributionKit APIsdoes not require showing App Tracking Transparency.For publisher apps, the key implementation steps areto add identifiers to your Info.plist from registered ad networks,then display ads that those networks have signed.For more details on how AdAttributionKit and its postback signals work,watch the video “Meet AdAttributionKit” from WWDC24.For advertised apps,you'll need to register conversion events within your app,along with any relevant re-engagements.Plus, you can specify an endpoint for getting a copy of postback signals.All of the relevant APIs for these updates are in the AdAttributionKit sectionof the Apple Developer documentation,and the video “What’s new in AdAttributionKit”details new capabilities in iOS 26.Finally, I will give you some tips around maintaining privacywhile managing local resources,such as on-device AI models, bundled frameworks, and app processes.First, I’m going to highlight the power of Core MLto run and even train or fine-tune machine learning models fully on-device.This works for a range of open-source modelsand models you custom-build with Create ML.With optimization and compression techniques,you can even run popular large-language modelswithout ever calling a server.Watch “Deploy machine learning and AI models on-device with Core ML”or “Bring your machine learning and AI models to Apple silicon”,both from WWDC24, to get started with Core ML.App group containers not only let you share databetween different apps you build, they also help protect that data.On macOS, other apps cannot access data in your app group containerwithout user permission.To use these containers,start by registering an app group identifierin the Developer Portal under Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles.You will then need to adopt the corresponding entitlement in your appand have it request the container directoryanytime you need to store user data.For more information, watch the video “What’s new in privacy” from WWDC24,or refer to “Configuring app groups” in the Apple Developer documentation.Also on macOS, note that all app processes should be terminatedwhen someone decides to quit the app.If you load processes using fork, exec, or POSIX spawn,clean up those processes on exit.macOS Tahoe will heuristically detect if such processes continue running,then show users a prompt to confirm if this aligns with their intent.Note that users will then have the option to terminate the processes themselves.Finally, remember that you are responsible for all code included in your apps,including third-party SDKs.Before you submit to the App Store, SDKs may require a privacy manifest filedescribing the data they collect and the required reasons APIs they use.Refer to “Privacy manifest files” in the Apple Developer documentationfor more details on when this requirement applies.You can also learn more by watching the video“Get started with privacy manifests” from WWDC23.These technologies are just a few examplesof how privacy is part of development.But now, I’ll shift to the next phase, and that’s testing.And yes, privacy is even part of this step.Just as you want to build tests for avoiding errorsor detecting performance regressions,building tests to confirm you deliver on your app’s privacy assurancesis an important best practice.At Apple, we think of tests in a pyramid model,where smaller tests form a foundation for broader onesthat more closely reflect the practical goals of people using an app.Unit tests help verify single pieces of code,generally individual functions.For privacy, they can validate app logic supporting privacy controls.Integration tests target discrete subsystems or clusters of classesto make sure that different components behave correctly together.In a privacy context, these ensure data flowsbetween systems work as expected.Finally, UI tests observe user-facing behaviors in your app,making sure it truly does what you expect.This includes common scenarios for onboardingor changing privacy settings.With my Pal About app, I had a privacy assuranceof only training on photos if people opted into improve intelligence features.So I would write a UI test to confirm that changing the opt-in settingalways updates the relevant data flows.Apple offers many tools to enable more efficient testingof privacy features.For example, starting in iOS 15.2,you can enable the App Privacy Report in Settingsto quickly review data access, sensor access,and network activity from your appand ensure they’re consistent with what peoplewho use your app would expect to find.Finally, I'll cover deployment,the process of actually getting your app out into the world.At this point, you’ve done a lot of workto deliver great privacy in the features you’ve built,and it's time to share your privacy story.As you create content to promote your app, your privacy assurancescan be a resource for building interest and setting your app apart.Deploying on the App Store also includes a few required stepsthat help people know what to expect in your app.In particular, privacy nutrition labels are a key waythe App Store helps people understand the privacy practices of apps.The label provides concise information on what types of datayour app transmits off device and how that data is used.Set up your nutrition labelin the App Privacy section of App Store Connect.Be sure to review the “App privacy details on the App Store” sectionof the Apple Developer documentation for specific definitions of data typesand terms such as “tracking.”When you archive a build in Xcode, select “Generate Privacy Report”from the archive’s context menu to get an aggregate report of data usesdeclared in privacy manifest files.Note that your nutrition label must document all potential uses of data,even if people choose whether to have that data collectedas part of the app experience.Though check the Apple Developer documentationfor certain exceptions,such as some feedback and reporting flows.You can update your nutrition label at any time,even without an app update.Watch the video “Create your Privacy Nutrition Label”from WWDC22 for more information.In addition to your nutrition label,be sure other privacy requirements for deployment have been met.Your app must have a clear privacy policy.Privacy manifests for your app and all third-party SDKsshould be included in Xcode.And purpose strings are required for any permission promptsto access device resources.You can also include a Privacy Choices link in your App Store listingfor people to learn more about managing data in your app,such as a portal to access, delete, or update such data.Planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.At every step of the process, integrating privacycan help deliver the best experience for people who use your app.Now, it’s time to apply these ideas to your process.Start by defining clear privacy assurances for your app.Then, use design principlesto educate people on data uses and choices.Implement your privacy goals with strong technical foundations.Ensure you deliver on privacy assurances with testing.And finally, prepare relevant nutrition labelsas you share your privacy story with the world.I mentioned data minimization several times in this video,but I will never minimize my thanks to you for investing in privacy.Thank you.

For more information on designing with privacy,check out the “Human Interface Guidelines” in the Apple Developer Documentation.

After planning and designing for privacy, it’s time to write some code.You can use many tools and technologies to implement your privacy goals.

In this section, I will highlight just a few examples ofhow you can use such tools when building your app.

I’ll start with ways you can streamline privacy choicesin your app's user interface.Accessing device resources, such as your calendar or current location,means sharing sensitive data across different contexts.So Apple’s platforms are designed to share this dataonly when it aligns with a user's intent.

Broad access has the most impact on privacy,so requesting it usually triggers an explicit permission prompt,such as this photo library prompt.

Watch the video “Meet the Location Button” from WWDC21 for more details.

These are just two examples of tools for reducingthe cognitive load of privacy UI.Others include: an out-of-process picker for contacts,the UIPasteControl button,and streamlined flows for setting up hardware accessories.Check for options to access only the device data you needbefore using a broader API.

Of course, in some cases, permission prompts may still be necessary.To help make them meaningful and contextual,perform actions that trigger themat times when the user would expect such a question to appear.Avoid presenting such choices the first time they open your app,and write purpose strings that clearly explainwhy someone is encountering that prompt.Now, I’ll go over some of the privacy technologiesthat can work behind the scenes as part of client-server interactions.In particular, I'll share a few ways to use server-side resourceswithout exposing sensitive data to the server,then how to reduce the need for identifiable datain addressing some common data collection scenarios.

On Apple platforms, Advanced Data Protectionis a feature that lets people enable end-to-end encryptionfor the vast majority of their data stored in iCloud.By adopting CloudKit, you can also enable end-to-end encryptionof data stored by your app in CloudKitwhenever someone enables Advanced Data Protection.This is possible without any changes to your infrastructureor additional management of encryption keys.

First, make sure to use encrypted data typesfor all fields in your CloudKit schema.

This includes CKAsset fields by default, and for most data types in CloudKit,there is an encrypted variant, such as EncryptedString.

Then you can use the encryptedValues APIto retrieve or store data on your CloudKit records.

All encryption and decryption operations are abstracted away by this API.

Note that CloudKit doesn’t support indexes on encrypted fields,so don’t include them in your predicate or sort descriptorswhen fetching records with CKQuery and CKQueryOperation.

Watch the video “What’s new in CloudKit?” from WWDC21 for more information.Another encryption technique we use at Appleis called homomorphic encryption.

Instead of computing over raw data,this lets you compute over encrypted payloadsand get the same output when decrypting the result.At no point during computation is the data decrypted.

By combining simple compute operations such as addition,homomorphic encryption can enable more advanced technologies,such as Private Information Retrieval.Using PIR, you can look up data from a serverwithout the query or result ever being availableon the server in a decrypted format.With PIR, the device sends an encrypted payload of the queryto the server,then the server uses homomorphic encryptionto compute an encrypted result.Remember, the computation itself is encrypted,so which result matches the query is not available to the serverin cleartext at any point during the lifetime of the request.

Finally, the server sends the encrypted resultback to the device for it to decrypt and process locally.

In my Pal About app,I could use PIR to get current information about meetup locationsfrom a server without the server being able totrack someone's search history.For some users, knowing what locations they explore in the appcould affect their safety,so the engineering choice of whether I use PIR in my appbecomes an important privacy decision.PIR is already used in features both on Apple platformsand in popular apps from developers just like you.

For more details on implementing PIR, check outthe Swift Homomorphic Encryption library and applications on GitHub.

Two common scenarios that may at first seem to requireidentifiable data collection are reducing fraud and ad attribution.I’ll share some of the features Apple has builtto help you accomplish your goals in these areaswhile reducing the need to collect data against a user ID or IP address.

For anti-fraud,Private Access Tokens can help assure that requests come from legitimate deviceswhile not identifying the people using them.

Devices receive anonymous tokens after being validated,and you can verify these tokenswithout needing additional identity information.

Watch the video“Replace CAPTCHAs with Private Access Tokens”from WWDC22 for more details.

You may also need to prevent fraudulent actions specific to your app,such as trying to redeem a promotion multiple times.DeviceCheck is an API that lets you associate up totwo bits of information with a given devicewithout needing to track device identifiers.These states are maintained by Appleand persist across reinstall or device transfers.Watch the video“Mitigate fraud with App Attest and DeviceCheck”from WWDC21 for more details on how to set and retrieve them.

For ad performance,AdAttributionKit is a powerful tool to measure the success of ad campaignswhile maintaining privacy.It lets you attribute app installs and re-engagements to a particular campaignthrough a signed postback signal from the user’s device.AdAttributionKit can also further help in reducing prompts.Calling AdAttributionKit APIsdoes not require showing App Tracking Transparency.For publisher apps, the key implementation steps areto add identifiers to your Info.plist from registered ad networks,then display ads that those networks have signed.For more details on how AdAttributionKit and its postback signals work,watch the video “Meet AdAttributionKit” from WWDC24.

For advertised apps,you'll need to register conversion events within your app,along with any relevant re-engagements.Plus, you can specify an endpoint for getting a copy of postback signals.All of the relevant APIs for these updates are in the AdAttributionKit sectionof the Apple Developer documentation,and the video “What’s new in AdAttributionKit”details new capabilities in iOS 26.

Finally, I will give you some tips around maintaining privacywhile managing local resources,such as on-device AI models, bundled frameworks, and app processes.

First, I’m going to highlight the power of Core MLto run and even train or fine-tune machine learning models fully on-device.

This works for a range of open-source modelsand models you custom-build with Create ML.With optimization and compression techniques,you can even run popular large-language modelswithout ever calling a server.

Watch “Deploy machine learning and AI models on-device with Core ML”or “Bring your machine learning and AI models to Apple silicon”,both from WWDC24, to get started with Core ML.

App group containers not only let you share databetween different apps you build, they also help protect that data.On macOS, other apps cannot access data in your app group containerwithout user permission.To use these containers,start by registering an app group identifierin the Developer Portal under Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles.You will then need to adopt the corresponding entitlement in your appand have it request the container directoryanytime you need to store user data.

For more information, watch the video “What’s new in privacy” from WWDC24,or refer to “Configuring app groups” in the Apple Developer documentation.Also on macOS, note that all app processes should be terminatedwhen someone decides to quit the app.

If you load processes using fork, exec, or POSIX spawn,clean up those processes on exit.macOS Tahoe will heuristically detect if such processes continue running,then show users a prompt to confirm if this aligns with their intent.Note that users will then have the option to terminate the processes themselves.

Finally, remember that you are responsible for all code included in your apps,including third-party SDKs.Before you submit to the App Store, SDKs may require a privacy manifest filedescribing the data they collect and the required reasons APIs they use.Refer to “Privacy manifest files” in the Apple Developer documentationfor more details on when this requirement applies.You can also learn more by watching the video“Get started with privacy manifests” from WWDC23.These technologies are just a few examplesof how privacy is part of development.But now, I’ll shift to the next phase, and that’s testing.And yes, privacy is even part of this step.

Just as you want to build tests for avoiding errorsor detecting performance regressions,building tests to confirm you deliver on your app’s privacy assurancesis an important best practice.At Apple, we think of tests in a pyramid model,where smaller tests form a foundation for broader onesthat more closely reflect the practical goals of people using an app.Unit tests help verify single pieces of code,generally individual functions.For privacy, they can validate app logic supporting privacy controls.

Integration tests target discrete subsystems or clusters of classesto make sure that different components behave correctly together.In a privacy context, these ensure data flowsbetween systems work as expected.Finally, UI tests observe user-facing behaviors in your app,making sure it truly does what you expect.This includes common scenarios for onboardingor changing privacy settings.With my Pal About app, I had a privacy assuranceof only training on photos if people opted into improve intelligence features.So I would write a UI test to confirm that changing the opt-in settingalways updates the relevant data flows.Apple offers many tools to enable more efficient testingof privacy features.For example, starting in iOS 15.2,you can enable the App Privacy Report in Settingsto quickly review data access, sensor access,and network activity from your appand ensure they’re consistent with what peoplewho use your app would expect to find.

Finally, I'll cover deployment,the process of actually getting your app out into the world.At this point, you’ve done a lot of workto deliver great privacy in the features you’ve built,and it's time to share your privacy story.As you create content to promote your app, your privacy assurancescan be a resource for building interest and setting your app apart.

Deploying on the App Store also includes a few required stepsthat help people know what to expect in your app.In particular, privacy nutrition labels are a key waythe App Store helps people understand the privacy practices of apps.The label provides concise information on what types of datayour app transmits off device and how that data is used.

Set up your nutrition labelin the App Privacy section of App Store Connect.Be sure to review the “App privacy details on the App Store” sectionof the Apple Developer documentation for specific definitions of data typesand terms such as “tracking.”When you archive a build in Xcode, select “Generate Privacy Report”from the archive’s context menu to get an aggregate report of data usesdeclared in privacy manifest files.Note that your nutrition label must document all potential uses of data,even if people choose whether to have that data collectedas part of the app experience.Though check the Apple Developer documentationfor certain exceptions,such as some feedback and reporting flows.You can update your nutrition label at any time,even without an app update.

Watch the video “Create your Privacy Nutrition Label”from WWDC22 for more information.

In addition to your nutrition label,be sure other privacy requirements for deployment have been met.Your app must have a clear privacy policy.Privacy manifests for your app and all third-party SDKsshould be included in Xcode.And purpose strings are required for any permission promptsto access device resources.

You can also include a Privacy Choices link in your App Store listingfor people to learn more about managing data in your app,such as a portal to access, delete, or update such data.

Planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.At every step of the process, integrating privacycan help deliver the best experience for people who use your app.Now, it’s time to apply these ideas to your process.Start by defining clear privacy assurances for your app.

Then, use design principlesto educate people on data uses and choices.

Implement your privacy goals with strong technical foundations.

Ensure you deliver on privacy assurances with testing.

And finally, prepare relevant nutrition labelsas you share your privacy story with the world.

I mentioned data minimization several times in this video,but I will never minimize my thanks to you for investing in privacy.Thank you.
