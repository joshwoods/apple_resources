Meet Liquid Glass

Search this video…Hi, I'm Jeff Nadeau, a frameworks engineering manager at Apple,and you’re watching  “Build an AppKit app with the new design”.The new design of macOS establishesa common foundation for the look and feel of Mac apps,with refreshed materials and controls throughout the system.A key element of this new design is the Liquid Glass material,a translucent surface that reflects and refracts light,creating a sense of depth and dynamism within the user interface.AppKit has everything you need to adapt to this new design.I’ll take you through the important changes to the framework,outlining the behaviors that you can expect on macOS Tahoeand the new APIs that you can useto fine-tune your adoption of the new design.I’ll go through these changes from the top down,starting with the basic structural components of your application.Then, I’ll introduce the scroll edge effect,a visual effect that provides legibility atop edge-to-edge scrolling content.The new design also includes a big update to the appearance and layout of controls.Finally, I’ll dig into the Liquid Glass material,how it works and the AppKit APIs that you can useto adopt glass in your custom UI elements.I'll get started with app structure.The new design system transforms the appearance of a Mac window,altering the window shape and framing its key structural regions in glass.One of those regions is the toolbar.In the new design system,toolbar elements are placed on a glass material,and the entire toolbar appears to float above the content,enhancing the sense of hierarchy within the window.The glass also brings controls together in logical groups.Since they all represent singular actions,AppKit automatically groups multiple toolbar buttons togetheron one piece of glass.Different types of controls are separated out into their own glass elements,like segmented controls, pop-up buttons and the search control.AppKit determines this grouping automaticallybased on the type of each item’s control view.To override the automatic behavior, use NSToolbarItemGroupto group items together or insert spacers to separate items.The Liquid Glass material is adaptive,which means that it reacts intelligently to its context,changing its appearance to suit the brightness of the content behind it.The toolbar glass will even switch between a light and dark appearanceif the scrolled content is especially bright or dark.This appearance change is communicated to the toolbar’s contentusing the NSAppearance systemso any work that you’ve done to support Dark Mode applies here as well.NSToolbar automatically puts the glass material behind every toolbar itembut not every item should appear over glass.Non-interactive items like custom titles and status indicatorsshould avoid the glass material.The informational text in the Photos toolbar is a great example.With the glass material backing, it almost looks like a button.You can remove the glass from an NSToolbarItemby setting the isBordered property to false.Now that's looking much better.For the rest of your toolbar items, the glass materialhas one other neat feature - tinting.Use the new style property on NSToolbarItemto specify a prominent style.The prominent style tints the glass using the accent color,which is perfect for displaying state or emphasizing an important action.To further customize the appearance of a prominent toolbar item,use the backgroundTintColor property to choose a specific color for the glass.There’s one other way to call attention to a toolbar item - badging.Use the NSItemBadge API to indicate that a toolbar item navigatesto new or pending content.For example, you can use a badge to indicate a number of unread messagesor the presence of new notifications.With glass toolbars handled, I’ll move on to the main content of the window,which is often organized using a split view.In the new design, sidebars appear as a pane of glass that floatsabove the window’s content,whereas inspectors use an edge-to-edge glass that sits alongside the content.To get this effect in your application, use NSSplitViewController.When you create split items with a sidebar or inspector behaviors,AppKit presents them with the appropriate glass material automatically.Now that the sidebar sits atop glass,the legacy sidebar material is no longer necessary.If you’re using an NSVisualEffectView to displaythat material inside of your sidebar,it will prevent the glass material from showing through.You should remove these visual effect views from your view hierarchy.Since the sidebar glass appears to float above the window,it can appear over content from the adjacent split.This works great if you have horizontal scrolling content,list items which slide over to reveal swipe actionsor rich content like a map or a movie posterthat can extend into the sidebar region.To allow your split content to appear underneath the sidebar,set the automaticallyAdjustsSafeAreaInsets property to true.Be sure to set this on the content that you want to extend under the sidebarand not on the sidebar itself.When this property is true, NSSplitView will extend that item’s framebeneath the sidebar and then apply a safe area layout guideto help you position your content within the unobscured area.Rich content, like photographs or artwork, really showcasethe floating glass material in the sidebar but it’s often undesirableto cover up some portion of the content to get that effect.This App Store poster creates a striking effect when displayed edge-to-edgebut the artwork doesn’t include any extra negative spaceto accommodate the size of the sidebar.Hiding the sidebar reveals what’s really happening here.The content is being mirrored and blurred, extending the appearance of the artworkwithout actually obscuring any of its content.AppKit has a new API that provides this effect.It's called NSBackgroundExtensionView.This view uses the safe area to position your contentin the unobscured portion of the view, while extending its appearanceedge-to-edge using a visual effect.To put this into practice, create a NSBackgroundExtensionViewand position it to fill the entire frame of the split item.Assign it a content view, which it positions in the safe area,avoiding the floating sidebar.And that's it.The background extension view will automatically create a replicaof the content view to fill the space outside of the safe area.The floating sidebar, along with the toolbar,demonstrate a key element of the new design system: concentricity.Each element is designed with a curvature that sits neatlywithin the corner radius of its container, in this case the window itself.And this relationship goes both ways.In the new design system, windows now have a softer, more generous corner radius,which varies based on the style of window.Windows with toolbars now use a larger radius,which is designed to wrap concentrically around the glass toolbar elements,scaling to match the size of the toolbar.Titlebar-only windows retain a smaller corner radius,wrapping compactly around the window controls.These larger corners provide a softer feel and elegant concentricity to the windowbut they can also clip content that sits close to the edge of the window.To position content that nests into a corner,use the new NSView.LayoutRegion API.A layout region describes an area of a view,like the safe area,but with features like corner avoidance built in.You can inset a region either horizontally or verticallyby the size of the corner.I'll take you through the API.You can obtain a region for either the safe areaor the area with standard layout margins.The region includes corner adaptation,which can apply either a horizontal or vertical inset to the region.From a layout region, use the layoutGuide methodto obtain a guide for applying auto layout constraints.You can also obtain the raw geometry of the regionin the form of edge insets or its current rectangle.Here’s an example of the new API in action.My new folder button is colliding with this corner,and I want to constrain it to a region that avoids this collision.So, in an updateConstraints method, I obtain a layout guide for the safe area,including horizontal corner adaptation.This layout guide is just like the typical safe area layout guidebut it includes an extra inset on the edge with the corner.Then, I create a few layout constraints to tie the button’s geometryto the safe area guide.It only took a few lines of code, and now my button sits nicelyalongside the corner.Next, I’ll introduce the scroll edge effect.The new design encourages flowing your content edge-to-edge,with Liquid Glass elements floating atop.To provide separation between the glass and the content,the system applies a visual effect in the areas where these two overlap.This effect comes in two variants: a soft-edge-style,which progressively fades and blurs the content, and a hard-edge-style,which uses a more opaque backing to provide greaterseparation between the content and the floating elements.For scrollable content,the scroll edge effect lives inside NSScrollView.The scroll view varies the size and shape of the effectbased on the content floating above it.The effect adapts automatically as floating elements come and go.The scroll edge effect is applied automatically underneath toolbar items,titlebar accessories, and a new type of accessory, split item accessories.Split item accessories are very similar to titlebar accessories,except they only span one split within a split view controller,and they can be placed at either the top or bottom edge of the split.To add a split item accessory,create a NSSplitViewItemAccessoryViewController,and attach it to the split view item using the addTopAligned-or addBottomAlignedAccessoryViewController method.Split item accessories, along with titlebar accessories, are the best wayto incorporate floating content into the scroll edge effect.They influence the size and shape of the effect,and they inset the content safe area, simplifying content layout.Now, no design system is complete without my personal favorite - controls.Controls have an all new look in macOS Tahoe.The new design creates a stronger family resemblance across devices,unifying the appearance of elements like buttons,switches and sliders between macOS, iOS and iPadOS.These changes have been thoughtfully applied to retain the characterand capability that you expect from Mac controls.macOS controls are available in a variety of standard sizes,ranging from mini all the way up to large.These sizes establish varying levels of densityand hierarchy among your controls.macOS Tahoe adds one more size to this list -extra large - for emphasizing your most important actions.The extra large size is idealfor showcasing the most prominent actions in your application.These are the actions that people launch your app to get done,like queuing up some music in a media playeror placing a call in a communications app.In addition to the new size,we’ve also taken the opportunity to rethink the heights of controls.Compared to previous releases of macOS,the mini, small, and medium controls are now slightly taller,providing a little more breathing room around the control labeland enhancing the size of the click target.To adapt to varying control heights,use Auto Layout and avoid hard-coding the heights of controls.For compatibility with existing high-density layouts,like complex inspectors and popovers,AppKit provides an API to request control sizesthat match previous releases of macOS.Use the new prefersCompactControlSizeMetricsproperty on NSView.This property is inherited down the view hierarchy,and when it's set to true,AppKit controls will revert to sizing that is compatiblewith previous releases of macOS.The new design system introduces some new control shapes as well.The mini through medium sizes retain a rounded-rectangle shape,which enables greater horizontal density,while the large and extra-large sizes round out into a capsule shape,making use of all that extra space.To achieve concentricity in your custom designs,you can override the preferred shape of a control.In this example, I’ve built a custom call-out barfor spell-checking using medium-sized controls.The container for the bar has a capsule shapebut it doesn’t fit well with the rounded rectangle controls inside.This is a perfect use case for the new borderShape property.This API allows you to override the shapes of buttons,pop-up buttons and segmented controls.By overriding these controls to use a capsule shape,they fit nicely within my custom container.In addition to the shape, you can also customizethe material of a button using the new glass bezel style.This bezel style replaces the standard button backingwith the Liquid Glass material,which is perfect for buttons that need to float atop other content.The glass bezel style is compatible with the existing bezelColor property,which tints the glass using the provided color.The new design system also introduces the idea of control prominence to AppKit.By varying the prominence of a button, you can control the level of visual weightgiven to its tint color.This allows you to add color to a button without upstaging higher-prominencecontrols inside the same interface, such as the default button.This technique is used for destructive buttons.The distinctive red color is a helpful hint that the action is destructivebut with a level of prominence that doesn’t overpower nearby controls.The tint prominence type has four cases: automatic,which indicates that the control should choose a levelof prominence appropriate for its style and configuration;none, which indicates minimal or no tint color;secondary, which indicates a more subdued application of the tint color;and primary, which applies the tint at the most prominent level.To apply a lower prominence tint to a button,set the tintProminence property to secondary.By default, this will display using the accent color.In this example, I’m treating the Play button a little differentlybecause I want it to behave as the default button,so I’ve given it the return key equivalent.This ensures that the button responds to the keyboard in a predictable way,and since it’s the default button, it’ll automatically applythe most prominent level of tint.Tint prominence also has a function with sliders.The tintProminence API allows you to choose whether the trackis filled with the accent color.A slider set to none will avoid filling its track,whereas a slider set to secondary or primary will fill it.The slider fill has learned one more trick in macOS Tahoe.It can anchor itself at any location along the track,rather than just the minimum end.Use the new neutralValue propertyto set a value that serves as the anchor for the track fill.In this example of a playback speed control,I’ve set the neutralValue to 1x, so that when the speed is made sloweror faster, the blue fill helps communicate the differencebetween the selected value and the default value.The new design system also brings an update to menuswith a refreshed appearance and a significant expansionin the use of icons.Both menu bar menus and context menus now use iconsto represent their key actions.Within each section of a menu,the icons form a single column that’s easy to scan through.Adding clear, recognizable symbols to your menu items helps people quicklyfind the most important actions in the menu.The “Get to know the new design system” video provides a ton of additional guidancefor choosing symbols for your menu items.Be sure to check it out.Finally, integrating Liquid Glass elements into your app.Before you integrate the Liquid Glass material into your custom UI elements,it’s important to think about the design intent behind this new material.Liquid Glass elements float at the top level of the UI,elevating the controls and navigation into a distinct functional layer.With that in mind, limit your use of Liquid Glassto the most important elements in your app,the controls that belong in this top level of hierarchy.Freeform’s inline editing controls are a great example.They float above the content rather than sitting alongside,and they work beautifully with the Liquid Glass material.To place your content on glass, use the NSGlassEffectView API.Setting a contentView allows AppKit to apply all of the necessary visualtreatments to keep your content legible as the glass adapts to its surroundings.So avoid placing the NSGlassEffectView behind your content as a sibling view.You can customize the appearance of the glass using the corner radiusand tint color properties.I’ll take you through an example of adopting NSGlassEffectViewfor an existing element.In this example, I have a fitness app which shows daily training statsand a custom control for picking the type of workout.I’m displaying them using a horizontal NSStackView.Now, this is a prominent part of my UI,so I’m going to put both parts of it on glass.Adopting the Liquid Glass material takes just a few new lines of code.First, create an NSGlassEffectView for each glass elementthat you want to displayand set each one’s contentView property to the desired view.The glass effect view ties its geometry to the contentView using Auto Layout,so you don’t have to worry about keeping them in sync.Then, put the glass effect views into the view hierarchy.In this example, I updated the stack view to swap in the new glass effect views.If you have multiple glass shapes in close proximity,group them together using NSGlassEffectContainerView.The glass effect container view combines multiple glass elements togetherinto a single rendering effect.This has a few benefits.First, grouped glass elements can fluidly joinand separate using a liquid visual effect.The glass shapes meld together based on their proximityand the value of the spacing property,which is available on NSGlassEffectContainerView.Second, the adaptive appearance of the glassis shared across the grouped elements,which ensures that they maintain a uniform appearanceas the underlying content changes.And grouping is important for visual correctness.The Liquid Glass material reflects and refracts light,picking color from nearby content.To create this effect,the glass material samples content from an area larger than itself.But what happens if that sampling region includes another glass element?Well, glass can’t directly sample other glass,so the visual results in this case will not be consistent.Using a glass effect container allows these elementsto share their sampling region.Not only does this provide a more consistent visual resultbut it also improves the performance of the glass effect,since it only needs one sampling pass for the entire group.Revisiting the sample from earlier,these two glass effects are part of a logical group,so they need to be inside a glass effect container.It’s straightforward to set one up.In this example, I create an NSGlassEffectContainerViewand set the stack view as its content view.The container and its content view are also constrained togetherusing Auto Layout,So I can cleanly swap this container into my existing layout.The Liquid Glass material is a powerful tool for elevating your app’s key controlsand enabling your content to flow seamlessly from edge to edge.It’s a great way to highlight the functionality that makesyour app unique.So what's next?As a first step, build your app with Xcode 26.A lot of the new design will start working right away.Extend your content edge-to-edge wherever possible,taking full advantage of the floating glass toolbar and sidebar.Then, adapt to the new control sizes by auditing your appfor hard-coded control heights or inflexible layout constraints.Enhance your menu actions with symbol iconsand identify key elements of your interface to elevatewith the Liquid Glass material.Thanks for watching and thanks for making great Mac apps.

First, create an NSGlassEffectView for each glass elementthat you want to displayand set each one’s contentView property to the desired view.The glass effect view ties its geometry to the contentView using Auto Layout,so you don’t have to worry about keeping them in sync.

Then, put the glass effect views into the view hierarchy.In this example, I updated the stack view to swap in the new glass effect views.

If you have multiple glass shapes in close proximity,group them together using NSGlassEffectContainerView.The glass effect container view combines multiple glass elements togetherinto a single rendering effect.This has a few benefits.

First, grouped glass elements can fluidly joinand separate using a liquid visual effect.The glass shapes meld together based on their proximityand the value of the spacing property,which is available on NSGlassEffectContainerView.

Second, the adaptive appearance of the glassis shared across the grouped elements,which ensures that they maintain a uniform appearanceas the underlying content changes.

And grouping is important for visual correctness.The Liquid Glass material reflects and refracts light,picking color from nearby content.

To create this effect,the glass material samples content from an area larger than itself.But what happens if that sampling region includes another glass element?Well, glass can’t directly sample other glass,so the visual results in this case will not be consistent.

Using a glass effect container allows these elementsto share their sampling region.Not only does this provide a more consistent visual resultbut it also improves the performance of the glass effect,since it only needs one sampling pass for the entire group.

Revisiting the sample from earlier,these two glass effects are part of a logical group,so they need to be inside a glass effect container.It’s straightforward to set one up.In this example, I create an NSGlassEffectContainerViewand set the stack view as its content view.The container and its content view are also constrained togetherusing Auto Layout,So I can cleanly swap this container into my existing layout.The Liquid Glass material is a powerful tool for elevating your app’s key controlsand enabling your content to flow seamlessly from edge to edge.It’s a great way to highlight the functionality that makesyour app unique.

So what's next?As a first step, build your app with Xcode 26.A lot of the new design will start working right away.Extend your content edge-to-edge wherever possible,taking full advantage of the floating glass toolbar and sidebar.

Then, adapt to the new control sizes by auditing your appfor hard-coded control heights or inflexible layout constraints.Enhance your menu actions with symbol iconsand identify key elements of your interface to elevatewith the Liquid Glass material.

Thanks for watching and thanks for making great Mac apps.
