SwiftUI Accessibility: Beyond the basics

Search this video…Hello, I’m Nicholas, an engineer on the Accessibility team.Accessibility empowers everyone to experienceand love the apps that you create.Today I’m going to go beyond the basics to explorehow you can make your Mac app more accessible.Mac apps are primarily designed for keyboard and mouse interactionswith denser user interfaces and powerful multitasking.These Mac-specific qualities bring important accessibility considerationsthat I will go over today.This includes representing your app’s layout to accessibility,accelerating navigation in your app,and making interactions in your app more accessible.On Mac, your app has a lot of space to display controls and content.Just as you visually lay out your interfaceto be understandable and intuitive,it is important to think about the way that this is conveyedto accessibility technologies.SwiftUI conveys the individual views that make up your appas accessibility elements.Accessibility elements contain the informationthat is needed for accessibility technologies to understandand interact with your app.If you are not familiar with accessibility elements,I recommend checking out Catch Up on Accessibility in SwiftUI from WWDC 2024.I have been building a new Mac app in SwiftUI to edit text documents.There’s a sidebar where I can switch pagesand mark the important ones with bookmarks.There’s also an inspector with controls I can use to format selected text,including a list of style presets that I can useto apply multiple formatting options at once.I really want this to be a great Mac app,and I know that means making it accessible to everyone.So from the beginning, I’ve been doing the accessibility basicsand testing new features I add with VoiceOver.As a reminder, VoiceOver is a screen reader that enables peoplewith varying levels of vision to use your app.VoiceOver allows the interface of your app to be heard as speech.VoiceOver on accessible text editor.Or felt as braille.Using VoiceOver is also a fantastic way to test the accessibility of your appbecause it makes full use of all the accessibility informationyour app provides.If your app works well with VoiceOver,you are well on the way to having a great experiencewith other accessibility technologies like Voice Control and Switch Control.On Mac, VoiceOver is primarily controlled by keyboard shortcuts.For example, there are keyboard shortcutsto move to the next and previous element on screen.Using these keyboard shortcuts,I can move the VoiceOver focus by one element at a timeto hear a description of it.Minimize, button, full screen, button, toolbar,my text document, sidebar, table, vertical splitter,edit text, insertion at end of text, vertical splitter,format inspector, scroll area.What may take a quick mouse movement across the screencould take someone who uses VoiceOver many key presses.Behind the scenes, VoiceOver is moving to the next accessibilityelement provided by SwiftUI.To make navigation faster with VoiceOver, SwiftUIcan group accessibility elements into a container accessibility elements.keyboard shortcuts to focus in and out of these containers.By default on Mac,VoiceOver navigates by container so that it is quickerto move across your app and only focus into a container when needed.A key difference with accessibility on Mac from other platformslike iPhone and iPad is that containers on Mac often contain nested containers.This creates a tree-like structure of accessibility elementsrepresenting your app’s interface.In your app, group related elements into containers,to make navigation quicker with VoiceOver.At the same time, be mindful of creating too many levels of nested containers.Sometimes this can make it harder to find elements in your appand adds time spent repeatedly focusing into containers.To refine containers in your app,use the accessibility element children modifier.When you apply the modifier to a view, the supplied behaviordetermines how the view and its subviews are represented to accessibility.There are three different behavior options.Contain will represent the view as an accessibility containerwhere the subviews are the accessibility elements within it.Combine will represent the view and its subviews asone accessibility element that merges all their attributes and actions together.Ignore will represent the view as one accessibility elementthat completely ignores the subviews.When I was testing my app with VoiceOver,I notice a couple areas I want to revisit.First, I will move VoiceOver one by onethrough the formatting inspector on the right.In Format Inspector, scroll area,22 items, heading styles.Title, Apply - button,Subtitle, Apply - button,Heading, Apply - button,Body, Apply - button,Bold, Toggle - button.I noticed I have to navigate through every single style presetbefore I get to the “Bold, Toggle - button”.These style presets are displayed using a VStack.I can use the accessibility element children modifierwith the contain behavior on the VStack to create a container.I can also use the accessibility label modifier to give this container a name.Now I will once again try moving VoiceOver one by onethrough the formatting inspector on the right.In Format Inspector, Scroll Area, 15 Items, Heading Styles,Style Presets, Group, Bold, Toggle Button.This is great. I don’t need to go through every style presetunless that's what I'm looking for.I want to make sure navigating within this style presets container works.I will focus VoiceOver into the style presets container,then move VoiceOver one by one.In style presets, Group, eight items title, Apply, Button, Subtitle,Apply, Button, Heading, Apply, Button, Body, Apply, Button.This is working, but I notice that the VoiceOver focuses onto the titleand the apply button of each style preset separately.A style preset is represented as a H stack containing a title view and a button view.I can use the accessibility element children modifierwith the combined behavior on the age stack to create one accessibility elementthat merges the properties of the title view and the button view.Now I will once again try moving VoiceOver one by onewithin the style presets container.In style presets, Group.For items, Title, Apply - button.Subtitle, Apply - button.Heading, Apply - button.Body, Apply - button.I can now go through each style preset as one element.This is easier to navigate and understand.Another aspect of the accessibility structure you can refineis the ordering of elements.In this example, visually Book Author is before Book Title.But I want the Book Title to be read first by VoiceOver,as it is easier to quickly skim through a lot of books.I can change the order of accessibility elementsusing the accessibility sort priority modifier.If I give the book title view a higher priority, it will be sorted first.By default, views have a sort priority of zero.The views with equal priorities are then sortedbased off their visual position.Now the book title will be spoken by  VoiceOverbefore the author and description.When testing your app with VoiceOver, if the ordering doesn’t feel right,use the accessibility sort priority modifier.Now that the accessibility structure of my app has been refined,I want to take navigation even further with rotors.With the bookmarks feature in my app, someone may be ableto quickly visually scan through the list of pages to see which are bookmarked.However, someone using VoiceOver would insteadhave to navigate over every page just to know if they have any bookmarks.Page 2 bookmarked.Page 3.Page 4.Page 5 bookmarked.Page 6.Page 7, Page 8 bookmarked, page 9, page 10.To make this as easy as the visual experience,someone using VoiceOver needs the ability to navigate by only bookmarked pages.To do this, I can use rotors.Rotors are an essential way to accelerate navigation for someone using VoiceOver.Rotors allow you to define collections of viewsor text ranges in your app that can be quickly moved between.To add a rotor of bookmarks to my pages list,I will use the accessibility rotor modifier,giving it the name Bookmarks.I can conditionally declare which of my pagesI want included in the Bookmarks rotor.Now when I focus VoiceOver on the Pages list in the sidebar,I can open the rotor menu with a keyboard shortcut,where I can go through all of my bookmarks quicklyand jump right to the bookmark page I want.Bookmarks menu.Page 2.Page 5.Page 5 bookmarked.Accessibility routers make what would have been time-consuming orcomplex navigation for someone using VoiceOver  into a great experience.When I navigate around my app with VoiceOver,I’m moving what’s called the VoiceOver focus.Accessibility technologies like VoiceOver maintain their own focus stateseparate from keyboard focus.In macOS and iOS 26, your app can suggest an initial focusfor accessibility technologies like VoiceOverusing the accessibility default focus modifier.When a new scene appears, SwiftUI will suggest the viewwith the modifier become focused,while still allowing the accessibility technologyto make the best decision based on someone’s preferences.Now that navigating to all the elements in my app is a breeze,I want to make sure that I can easily interact with them as well.In my app, I added the ability to bookmark a pagewith a button that appears when I hover the pointerover a page thumbnail.Visually, this is nice as the thumbnails are not obstructedwhen I don't need the button.However, since someone using VoiceOver isn’t moving the pointer,they would never be able to access the button.In your app, any interaction that requires hovering the pointeror performing a trackpad gesture may not be accessible to everyone.You should provide other ways of discoveringand performing these interactions.Fortunately, SwiftUI provides an easy way to do this.You can add accessibility actions to a viewthat accessibility technologies like VoiceOver can performin a way that is accessible.To add an accessibility action to a view, use the accessibility action modifier.I use this modifier to add a bookmark action to the views in my pages list.It's as simple as adding a button.Now I will use VoiceOver to focus on a page thumbnailand use my new bookmark accessibility action.Page 3.Actions menu.Two items.Show alternate items.Bookmark page 3.Bookmark page 3.I was able to open the Actions menu with a keyboard shortcutand easily bookmark the page.Other accessibility technologies like Switch Control and Voice Controlalso rely on these accessibility actions.Another quick way to improve interaction with your app is keyboard shortcuts.Adding keyboard shortcuts for common tasks in your appis not only a great power user feature,it also has a huge impact on accessibility,especially for anyone who may not be able to use a mouse.Lastly, if you create your own custom controls,they may not have the accessibility informationthat other controls have built in.To learn how to easily make controls accessible in SwiftUI,I recommend checking out “SwiftUI Accessibility: Beyond the basics”from WWDC 2021.Now it’s your turn to try your app with VoiceOver on Mac,refine the containers in your app,and investigate where you can add custom rotors.And finally, you can showcase the great accessibility of your appwith accessibility nutrition labels.To learn more, check out“Evaluate your app for Accessibility Nutrition Labels”.Thank you for watching.

Hello, I’m Nicholas, an engineer on the Accessibility team.Accessibility empowers everyone to experienceand love the apps that you create.

Today I’m going to go beyond the basics to explorehow you can make your Mac app more accessible.Mac apps are primarily designed for keyboard and mouse interactionswith denser user interfaces and powerful multitasking.These Mac-specific qualities bring important accessibility considerationsthat I will go over today.

This includes representing your app’s layout to accessibility,accelerating navigation in your app,and making interactions in your app more accessible.

On Mac, your app has a lot of space to display controls and content.Just as you visually lay out your interfaceto be understandable and intuitive,it is important to think about the way that this is conveyedto accessibility technologies.SwiftUI conveys the individual views that make up your appas accessibility elements.

Accessibility elements contain the informationthat is needed for accessibility technologies to understandand interact with your app.If you are not familiar with accessibility elements,I recommend checking out Catch Up on Accessibility in SwiftUI from WWDC 2024.I have been building a new Mac app in SwiftUI to edit text documents.

There’s a sidebar where I can switch pagesand mark the important ones with bookmarks.

There’s also an inspector with controls I can use to format selected text,including a list of style presets that I can useto apply multiple formatting options at once.

I really want this to be a great Mac app,and I know that means making it accessible to everyone.So from the beginning, I’ve been doing the accessibility basicsand testing new features I add with VoiceOver.

As a reminder, VoiceOver is a screen reader that enables peoplewith varying levels of vision to use your app.

VoiceOver allows the interface of your app to be heard as speech.

On Mac, VoiceOver is primarily controlled by keyboard shortcuts.For example, there are keyboard shortcutsto move to the next and previous element on screen.Using these keyboard shortcuts,I can move the VoiceOver focus by one element at a timeto hear a description of it.

Minimize, button, full screen, button, toolbar,my text document, sidebar, table, vertical splitter,edit text, insertion at end of text, vertical splitter,format inspector, scroll area.What may take a quick mouse movement across the screencould take someone who uses VoiceOver many key presses.

Behind the scenes, VoiceOver is moving to the next accessibilityelement provided by SwiftUI.

To make navigation faster with VoiceOver, SwiftUIcan group accessibility elements into a container accessibility elements.

keyboard shortcuts to focus in and out of these containers.By default on Mac,VoiceOver navigates by container so that it is quickerto move across your app and only focus into a container when needed.

A key difference with accessibility on Mac from other platformslike iPhone and iPad is that containers on Mac often contain nested containers.This creates a tree-like structure of accessibility elementsrepresenting your app’s interface.In your app, group related elements into containers,to make navigation quicker with VoiceOver.

At the same time, be mindful of creating too many levels of nested containers.

Sometimes this can make it harder to find elements in your appand adds time spent repeatedly focusing into containers.

To refine containers in your app,use the accessibility element children modifier.

When you apply the modifier to a view, the supplied behaviordetermines how the view and its subviews are represented to accessibility.

There are three different behavior options.

Contain will represent the view as an accessibility containerwhere the subviews are the accessibility elements within it.

Combine will represent the view and its subviews asone accessibility element that merges all their attributes and actions together.Ignore will represent the view as one accessibility elementthat completely ignores the subviews.

When I was testing my app with VoiceOver,I notice a couple areas I want to revisit.

First, I will move VoiceOver one by onethrough the formatting inspector on the right.In Format Inspector, scroll area,22 items, heading styles.Title, Apply - button,Subtitle, Apply - button,Heading, Apply - button,Body, Apply - button,Bold, Toggle - button.

I noticed I have to navigate through every single style presetbefore I get to the “Bold, Toggle - button”.

These style presets are displayed using a VStack.

I can use the accessibility element children modifierwith the contain behavior on the VStack to create a container.I can also use the accessibility label modifier to give this container a name.

Now I will once again try moving VoiceOver one by onethrough the formatting inspector on the right.

In Format Inspector, Scroll Area, 15 Items, Heading Styles,Style Presets, Group, Bold, Toggle Button.This is great. I don’t need to go through every style presetunless that's what I'm looking for.I want to make sure navigating within this style presets container works.I will focus VoiceOver into the style presets container,then move VoiceOver one by one.

In style presets, Group, eight items title, Apply, Button, Subtitle,Apply, Button, Heading, Apply, Button, Body, Apply, Button.

This is working, but I notice that the VoiceOver focuses onto the titleand the apply button of each style preset separately.

A style preset is represented as a H stack containing a title view and a button view.

I can use the accessibility element children modifierwith the combined behavior on the age stack to create one accessibility elementthat merges the properties of the title view and the button view.

Now I will once again try moving VoiceOver one by onewithin the style presets container.In style presets, Group.For items, Title, Apply - button.Subtitle, Apply - button.Heading, Apply - button.Body, Apply - button.I can now go through each style preset as one element.This is easier to navigate and understand.

Another aspect of the accessibility structure you can refineis the ordering of elements.In this example, visually Book Author is before Book Title.But I want the Book Title to be read first by VoiceOver,as it is easier to quickly skim through a lot of books.I can change the order of accessibility elementsusing the accessibility sort priority modifier.

If I give the book title view a higher priority, it will be sorted first.By default, views have a sort priority of zero.The views with equal priorities are then sortedbased off their visual position.

Now the book title will be spoken by  VoiceOverbefore the author and description.

When testing your app with VoiceOver, if the ordering doesn’t feel right,use the accessibility sort priority modifier.

Now that the accessibility structure of my app has been refined,I want to take navigation even further with rotors.

With the bookmarks feature in my app, someone may be ableto quickly visually scan through the list of pages to see which are bookmarked.However, someone using VoiceOver would insteadhave to navigate over every page just to know if they have any bookmarks.

Page 2 bookmarked.Page 3.Page 4.Page 5 bookmarked.Page 6.Page 7, Page 8 bookmarked, page 9, page 10.To make this as easy as the visual experience,someone using VoiceOver needs the ability to navigate by only bookmarked pages.
