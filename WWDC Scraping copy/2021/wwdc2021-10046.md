Meet the new Photos picker

Search this video…♪ ♪Hi. My name is Justin.I'm a Photos engineer.Together with my colleague, Adam, we will talk aboutways to improve access to Photos in your app.First, I will talk about the improvements we madeto the system Photos picker.Then, Adam will show the new cloud identifier APIsand how you can use them to identify the same assetacross different devices.Lastly, he will also discuss changesto the limited library access mode.Let's start with the Photos picker.In iOS 14, we introduced PHPicker,the modern replacement for UIImagePickerController.The PHPicker API ensures privacywhile providing your app the features you need,like multiple image selection and search.If you haven't heard of PHPicker,you can watch our WWDC 2020 "Meet the new Photos picker"session to learn more about it.In iOS 15, the system Photos pickerhas four major improvements.First, privacy.We believe it's important to let people know what informationyour app can access, which increases trust.In iOS 14, some people may assumethat your app has access to their entire photo library,even if it only presents the out-of-process Photos pickerand only has access to photos they selected.To help people understand the difference,we added a new section to Settings > Privacy > Photos.The new section contains apps that only use the systemPhotos picker, explaining that those appsonly have access to photos people selected.We really encourage you to replace your custom pickerwith the system one if you haven't done so already.Next, let's talk about ordered selection.Sometimes, people may want to controlthe order of photos when selecting them.In iOS 15, your app can configure the pickerto show the selection order, as shown here.By default, we will still show the selection checkmark.To opt in to the new ordered selection behavior,you only need to enable multiple selectionand set "selection" to "ordered."The PHPicker API works greatwhen all someone needs to do is to select new photos.But what if people also want to deselect photosusing the picker?In iOS 15, a new preselection API is available for you to use.But before we talk about the new API, let's revisithow the PHPicker API is used currently.You just need to create a PHPickerConfiguration objectand use it to initialize the picker.When the picker session is completed,selected photos will be returned to your app.Suppose the configuration is initializedwith a PHPhotoLibrary object, picker results will containboth item providers and asset identifiers.Your app can use the item providerto load and display selected photos.In iOS 15, you can also present the pickerwith some photos initially selected.It allows people to select more photosor deselect those photos preselected by your app.To do it, you need to create a new configuration object.You can give the configuration an array of asset identifiersyou retrieved previously, ID: 1 and ID: 2 in this case.When a new PHPickerViewControlleris presented, photos with ID: 1and ID: 2 will be selected by default.People can deselect them or select additional photos.You still want to keep the old picker results for nowbecause you will need to use them later.Let's say the photo with ID: 2 is deselected,but a new photo with ID: 3 is added to the selection.When the picker session is completed,selected photos will be returned.But the first result only has the asset identifierwithout the actual asset data.Why?Because it was selected by your app.All results not selected by peopleusing your app have empty item providers.Old picker results have actual asset data,so you can use the old ID: 1 result to replacethe one with the empty item provider.Because ID: 2 is no longer selected,you can discard the old ID: 2 result.OK.Now we can continue handling selected photos like before.To summarize: if a picker session is completed,all selected assets, including preselected assetsthat haven't been deselected, will be returned.And keep in mind, returned item providersfor preselected assets will be empty.In the case a picker session is canceled,only preselected assets will be returned.All item providers will be empty.All right, let's take a look at the code.To set preselected assets, you only need to initializethe configuration with a photoLibrary objectand enable multiple selection.You can set preselected assets using the newpreselectedAssetIdentifiers API.In the delegate callback, you need to retrievethe existingSelection from the previous picker session.Then, you can iterate through allof the newly returned picker results.You should replace new results with the old resultsif they are part of the existing selection.Finally, you can save the updated selection.Last but not least, let's talk about progress reporting.It can take some time to download a large assetif it's not available locally on the device,which can happen if iCloud Photosand Optimize Storage are turned on.Previously, you can only show a spinner while loading,which is not always the ideal user experience.I'm happy to announce that in iOS 15, your app canretrieve the actual loading progress from the picker.The loading progress is availablevia the existing NSItemProvider API.You can use the returned progressto show a loading UI accordingly.That's all for the Photos picker update.Now I will hand over to my colleague, Adam,to talk more about the new cloudIdentifier APIs.Thanks, Justin.With the new features and APIs we've added,Photos picker is the best way for most developersto use Photos in their apps.But we know there are special categories of applicationsthat require a deeper level of access and integrationfor managing or editing photos,custom cameras, or apps that give people a wayto browse their photo library in a unique way.For those apps, PhotoKit provides a rich setof APIs for accessing and updating photos,videos, and albums stored in the photo library.Assets and albums are given unique identifiersby PhotoKit that can be saved in your appand then later used to retrievethe same records from the photo library.Every photo library and its identifiers are specificto the device they are running on,even when those devices are syncinglibraries with iCloud Photos.So let's turn our attention back to your app.People love the way they can use apps on an iPhonewhen they're out and about and then, back at their desk,use a laptop or iPad to take advantage of the larger format.Your customers want a seamless experiencewhen switching from one device to another.For example, let's say I've builta photo journaling app for peopleto document experiences with pictures and comments.It's perfect as an iPhone app for capturing content on the go.They should be able to pick up working on that journalright where they left off when they open my appon an iPad or Mac, with all the photosand content they added on their phone.So how does that work?How do you find the same assets when each device hasits own photo library and distinct identifiers?It works by using the new cloud identifier APIs.They give you a way to find the same assetsand albums between devices.You use cloud identifiers to look up the local identifiersthat are unique to each photo library.And these new APIs are available on every platformthat supports PhotoKit: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS.The goal is to give you a simple way to map assetsbetween devices without having to worry about the cloud.It's designed to work best when running on an accountsigned in to iCloud Photos, but cloud identifiers will workeven if the account is signed out or runningon a system that has never been signed in to iCloud.It's all based on identifier mapping, so let's be clear.There are two kinds of identifiers.Local identifiers are what I talked about earlier,the identifiers you use on the devicethat are specific to that library.If you've used PhotoKit before,you've seen them called localIdentifiers in the API.Cloud identifiers are the new API, which are usedto look up local identifiers on one device or another.They are represented by a newly available classcalled PHCloudIdentifier.Let's dig in to how to use them.We'll start on the source device, where your app hasgathered a list of local identifiers for some assets.From that array of local identifiers,we want to get the corresponding cloud identifiers.Here's an example of how to use the API to get them.This call to the photo library returns a dictionarywith cloudIdentifierMapping objectsfor each localIdentifier.We'll iterate through that dictionary and geta cloudIdentifier from the cloudMapping object.I'll talk about error handling in a bit.For now, we should have our cloud identifiersand we're ready to use them.And the biggest benefit of cloud identifiersis using them everywhere, so we need to share themto other cloud-connected devices.You want to make them available to your appwhen it runs on any deviceconnected to this iCloud account.You can archive cloud identifiers to a stringand share that data using CloudKitor another network data service.How you package up this data is really up to youand your app's needs.Think about how you'll use the informationon a second device.How do you reconstruct the application state to includethe content referenced by those cloud identifiers?Now, on a second device, once you've downloaded and unarchivedthe cloud identifiers, we want to use them to look upthe library-specific local identifiers.Working in the other direction, this call to the photo libraryreturns a dictionary with localIdentifierMapping objectsfor each cloudIdentifier.Again, we'll iterate through the dictionary and this time geta localIdentifier from the localMapping object.Once I have all the localIdentifiers,I can use them to fetch and displaythe assets I had on the source device.You can see how the API makes it easy to look up identifiersin both directions, but the reality of differentdevice configurations, account settings,network states, and countless other variablescan mean things aren't always that simple.To handle that complexity, the API uses a pairof helper objects to hold a valid identifieror an error indicating why the mapping failed.There are two kinds of errors you should handlewhen looking up identifier mappings.If the photo library isn't able to resolve an identifier mappingbecause the underlying record isn't present or the appdoesn't have access to it, the mapping object returnedby the API will contain the Identifier Not Found error.Here you can see how we're getting the error codefrom the localIdentifierMapping objectif the identifier isn't set.For an Identifier Not Found error, it makes senseto keep track of the unresolved cloudIdentifier so we can puta placeholder in the UI to indicate the photocouldn't be found on this device.The other type of error happens if we can't resolvean identifier mapping uniquely.In other words, there are multiple assetsthat match the provided cloud identifier.This can happen if the cloud state isn'ttotally in sync on this device and the library has to relyon the image content to find a match.In this case, the mapping object will havea Multiple Identifiers Found error, and the erroruser info will contain the matching identifiers.With the Multiple Identifiers Found error code,we can get the matching local identifiersfrom the error user info using the LocalIdentifiersErrorKey.In this example, we've stashed themin a dictionary so we can later fetchand show the matching assets and let the customer decide.That's an overview of cloud identifiers and how to use them.Keep in mind that looking up the mappingsbetween local and cloud identifiers can be expensive,so use local identifiers in your app interactionswith the photo library, perform the mapping workat load and save points, and then store and sharethe cloud identifiers to make them available on other devices.Next up, limited library.Before we dive into the updates to limited library,let's quickly review how photo library access works.When someone launches an app and requests accessto photos data using PhotoKit,the system requires their permissionbefore granting the app access.And the first time this happens,they'll see an alert like this one.This is really important to our customers.It gives them the control over how much accessto give this application:to allow access to a limited selection of photos,full access to their entire library,or to deny access completely.If they choose the Select Photos option,then the app is granted limited library access.You can refer to our WWDC '20 session"Handle the Limited Photos Library in your app"for a more complete description of limited library modeand how to design your app to work best with it.For now, it's enough to know that limited library accessis designed to be transparent to the app developer.In general, PhotoKit APIs should worklike normal, behaving like the libraryonly contains the photos that were selected.It works conveniently with common workflows.For example, when an app adds a phototo the library, that photo is automaticallyincluded in the app's limited library selection.There is another workflow we see in appsusing a custom album to keep trackof the assets they've added.But in iOS 14, limited library modedid not allow creation or access to custom albums.I'm happy to tell you that in iOS 15, we've addedsupport for applications to create, fetch,and update their own albums when running in limited library mode.Now let's turn our attention to a different workflow,and for this, I'm going to refer backto my example photo journaling app.Since I want to give my customers a great experiencewhen they've chosen limited library access for my app,I've customized the interfaceto present limited library pickeras part of creating a new journal.This provides a natural step during journal creationfor them to choose more photos.But once the selection is updated,it would be great to know what photos were added,since they're the ones my customer wantsto use in this journal.With a new presentLimitedLibraryPickerAPI in iOS 15, I can pass ina completion handler that gives me the identifiersof the photos they just selected in the picker.This lets me know when the selection update is doneand which assets they added.That covers our updates for limited library,support for apps to create and work with their own albums,and a new API to give apps a way to trackwhat was added to the limited library selection.That's most of what we had to talk about today,but before we go, I'd like to leave you with the following.For those who haven't updated your code in a while,it's time to move away from Assets Library.It's been deprecated since iOS 9,and we're planning to remove it in a future SDK.This is the time to move to the new Photos pickeror PhotoKit for a deeper integration with photos.And one more reason to make the move to PhotoKit:we know we've had long-standing gaps in error handling,and I'm so happy to tell you that we've finallyaddressed those with new error codes to identifythe underlying issue during change request processing,resource requests, and library access calls.We can't wait for you to check out all the great new featureswe've added to Photos picker and PhotoKit in iOS 15.Thank you.

When a new PHPickerViewControlleris presented, photos with ID: 1and ID: 2 will be selected by default.People can deselect them or select additional photos.

You still want to keep the old picker results for nowbecause you will need to use them later.

Let's say the photo with ID: 2 is deselected,but a new photo with ID: 3 is added to the selection.

When the picker session is completed,selected photos will be returned.But the first result only has the asset identifierwithout the actual asset data.Why?Because it was selected by your app.All results not selected by peopleusing your app have empty item providers.

Old picker results have actual asset data,so you can use the old ID: 1 result to replacethe one with the empty item provider.Because ID: 2 is no longer selected,you can discard the old ID: 2 result.

OK.Now we can continue handling selected photos like before.To summarize: if a picker session is completed,all selected assets, including preselected assetsthat haven't been deselected, will be returned.And keep in mind, returned item providersfor preselected assets will be empty.

In the case a picker session is canceled,only preselected assets will be returned.All item providers will be empty.

All right, let's take a look at the code.To set preselected assets, you only need to initializethe configuration with a photoLibrary objectand enable multiple selection.You can set preselected assets using the newpreselectedAssetIdentifiers API.

In the delegate callback, you need to retrievethe existingSelection from the previous picker session.Then, you can iterate through allof the newly returned picker results.You should replace new results with the old resultsif they are part of the existing selection.Finally, you can save the updated selection.
