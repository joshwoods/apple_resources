Introducing Accelerate for Swift

Search this video…♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Jonathan Hogg: Hello, and welcome to this sessionon the Accelerate and associated frameworks.I'm Jonathan from Apple's Vector & Numerics team,and today I'm going to talk to you brieflyabout the Accelerate frameworkbefore telling you what's new in our machine learning library,BNNS.I'll then cover improvements to simd.h,and introduce Apple Archive,and our new Apple Encrypted Archive containers.So let's get started with a brief overviewof the Accelerate framework.Accelerate provides high-performancenumerical computation across all Apple platforms:MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS.Accelerate also provides accessto the machine learning acceleratorsin Apple Silicon Macs and recent iPhone and iPad devices.The only way to leverage this hardwareis by calling Accelerate either directlyor through higher-level frameworks such as Core ML.Accelerate is composed of several parts.vDSP provides primitives for signal processingsuch as DFT and FFT routines.vImage provides routines for image processingsuch as format conversion and convolution.vForce provides vectorized versionsof transcendental functions such as sine and cosine.BLAS and LAPACK provide high-performance implantationsof the standard dense matrix algebra routines,while Sparse BLAS and our Sparse Solversprovide similar functionality for sparse matrices.Finally, BNNS provides support for machine learning.I'm also going to talk to you todayabout some related frameworks.simd.h provides computational small vectors and matrices,such as those covered in graphics programming,whilst Compression and Apple Archiveprovide support for lossless data compression.In order to use these frameworks,simply add the relevant include or import statement to your codeand add the framework to your Xcode project.Now, let me tell you about BNNS in more detail.BNNS stands for Basic Neural Network Subroutinesand provides performance primitives for machine learningon the CPU.For those of you unfamiliar with Apple's machine learning ecosystem,this diagram shows the lay of the land.There are three main hardware blocks:the CPU, which includes the machine learning acceleratorsI mentioned previously;the GPU; and the separate neural engine.BNNS provides performance primitives on the CPUin the same way as MPS provides performance primitiveson the GPU.Above this layer, there are a number of frameworksthat run on one or more of these backends.These include Apple's high-level machine learning frameworks --Core ML and Create ML --as well as the specialist frameworkslike Vision and Natural Language.BNNS provides support for both training and inferenceacross a wide range of layer types,as well as support for the optimizers shown at the bottom.In this release,we have added support for several new layer types:embedding, random fill, and quantization;as well as support for AdamW optimizer.We've also improved existing layers,adding two new activation functions:SiLU and HardSwish,as well as support for new arithmetic functions:ternary select, multiply add,as well as element-wise minimum and maximum.Layer fusions provide the abilityto consume the output of one layer immediatelyas the input to a subsequent layer,avoiding the need to write it out to memoryand read it back in again.We've added layer fusions of convolutionand fully connected layers with the new quantization layer,as well as a fusionbetween the arithmetic and normalization layers.Other improvements include improved supportfor gradient clipping in the optimizer,which can also be used as standalone functions,as well as AMSGrad support for our Adam-based optimizers.Together, these improvements have expanded the rangeand network architectures we can accelerate even further.Now, let me tell you about some improvements to simd.h.simd.h provides computational primitives on small vectorsand matrices that fit into the CPU's registers,including support for functions such as sine and cosineas well as useful geometric operations,including support for quaternions.The thing I really like about simd.h is it lets us jump inand get 90 percent of the benefit of vectorizationwith 10 percent of the effort.Here, let me show you.Here's a neural network activation functionI just invented.As you can see, it has three different branches.If the input is less than minus pi,I just return zero.If it's between minus pi and pi,I return two times the exponent of x,multiplied by x plus pi over two.Otherwise, if it's greater than pi,I return two times the exponent.That's great, but if I have a large amount of data,I may want to run it faster than a scalar loop allows.So let me show you how to implement that in simd.I already have some boilerplate in place,an extension which allows me to easily write vectorsto a buffer,and a simple loop that iterates over our output arrayin increments of one length eight vector at a time.The interesting part is how to translate our scalar functioninto a simd equivalent.Let's start by looking again at our scalar code.I see it has several branches.These don't work well for vectorization.Instead, let's construct this out of parts we can mergebased on a mask.Looking more closely, if x is less than minus pi,I just return zero.If it's greater,I return an expression involving two times exponent of x.Let's pull that out.Now, we want to construct a vector from that y,replacing with zero everywherethat x is element-wise less than minus pi.Next, we can look at a greater than case.Here, we are either multiplying by one in the high region,or by x plus pi over two in the middle region.So let's write that in the same way.We take our x plus pi over two expressionand this time we're replacing with one everywherethat x is element-wise greater than or equal to pi.Now all that remainsis to multiply these two quantities together.Obviously, if a zero element, multiplying by either value of bstill returns zero.So let's run that and see how it looks.Now, I can see -- looking down the console --that my new simd version is almost three times fasterthan the previous scalar code.So how is simd improved in this release?We've improved usability for C++ programmers using templates.We have added types and traits structuresto allow you to move between the underlying scalar typeand vector length and the concrete simd typewithout complicated code structuresor needing to implement similar types yourself.To simplify their use, we have also added convenient aliasesto reduce the need for C++ boilerplate.Here's an example of what they look like in use.The vector and matrix types allow us to gofrom an underlying type -- such as float or int --and a vector length to a concrete typeand also have members providing access to related types,such as the unaligned versionand the mask type resulting from comparisons.The Vector_t and Matrix_t aliasesprovide simplified syntax to access the same definitionsas we had before.The get_traits struct allows us to go in the other direction,moving from the concrete simd type to the generic one.And again, there are aliases to simplify the syntaxfor common use cases.We've also added templated versionsof the make and convert functionsto allow their use in templated code.These work the same as the existing functions,but their destination type is now a template parameterrather than part of the function name.In addition to our C++ improvements,we have added several new functionssupported across all our languages.These are classification functions --like isfinite and isinf --that provide vector versions of the scalar functions in libm,as well as new functions for calculating the gamma function,as well as the trace of simd matrices.Now, introducing Apple Archiveand our new Apple Encrypted Archive formats.Apple Archive has been powering our system updatesfor the better part of a decade.In the macOS 11 release,we gave you access to the compressed containerand archive format.New in macOS 12,we have added APIs for encryption to this support.The archive format itselfprovides a modern, modular approach,allowing you to select exactly which file attributesand metadata you want to store.It is streamable, which means you don't have to worry aboutfitting the entire data in memory at once.It also supports separate manifest filesfor indexing into large archives like file system images.The new Apple Encrypted Archive builds on this,combining compression, authenticated encryption,and a digital signature into a single secure package.It gives you state-of-the-art cryptographythat's been designed and audited by our Security team,as well as outside experts.Data confidentiality means that your data stays secret.Data authenticity means that you can be sureit hasn't been corrupted in transit.Sender authentication means you can be sure who sent it.Signature privacy means that in a public key context,only you and the sender know who has signed it.We also obfuscate metadata -- such as the file lengths --and include resigning attack protection.Together, this means you can be confidentthat your data remains private and secure.In order to facilitate correct deployment,we offer a number of different profilesfor different use cases.The basic profile is to have a digital signaturewithout encryption.This can be used for things like software updateswhere the contents are not secret,but you want to be sure the data hasn't been tampered with.Next, we have symmetric encryption,with or without a signature,using a securely shared binary key.This is similar to the next optionwhich uses a password rather than a binary key.Finally, we have full-blown public key encryption,again with or without signature.In all profiles, compression is optionaland data is always authenticated.To work with these formats,we provide a number of command-line tools.For working with the compressed archive portion of the format,there is compression_tool,and for the encrypted archive, there is aea.The aa tool handles the entire container.There is of course also an APIprovided by the Apple Archive framework in both Swift and C.It is stream-based,allowing for both sequential and random access.Its implementation is multithreadedfor blazingly fast performance.So, let's see this API in action.Here, we have a simple demo app we have put together.The top portion of the window acts as a drag-and-drop targetfor things we want to encrypt,whilst the bottom part is a simple status pane.Let's say I want to encrypt this TopSecret directory.I just drag and drop this into the app.And, oh no! We get an error.We haven't implemented this function yet!Let's do that now.So, what do we need to do to encrypt this with Apple Archive?First, we need an encryption contextthat describes the algorithm and profile to use,along with our encryption secret.We also need a file stream we're going to write the archive to.We combine these to create an encryption stream.The encryption stream will encrypt a stream of bytes,so we need an adaptor that will translate the directorywe want to encrypt into such.This is the encoder stream.The data, of course, flows in the opposite directionto the object creation.We feed archive entries into the encoder stream,which transform them into bytes for the encryption stream,which then outputs the encrypted data to the file stream.Let's see how that looks in code.Here, we specify that we're using a symmetric profile.And the "none" tells usthat we're going to use no digital signature.The initial portion of the enumjust specifies the particular algorithm we want to use.Here, we're going to use "lzfse" to compress our data.With the context created,we just need to specify our symmetric encryption key.Next, we create those three streams.First, we create the file stream,then we combine it with a contextto create the encryptionStream.Finally, we derive the encoderStream.Now, it's important that we rememberto close these streams in the correct order.In particular, closing the encryptionStreamdoes a lot of work behind the scenes,as it signs and seals the archive.Finally, all that remainsis for us to feed our files into the encoderStream.I specify the file attributes I want to encodeand then call the writeDirectoryContents method.All that remains is print a status message to the consolewith the encryption key.Let's see if that worked.If I drop our TopSecret directory into the app,it succeeds, encrypts it, and prints out our encryption key.Now, if I drag and drop our encrypted archive into the app,it tries to decrypt it and asks for the encryption key.So let's copy and paste that encryption keyand let's see what's inside.Mmm, delicious!That's everything I have for you on Apple Encrypted Archive,so let's wrap up.Today, I talked to you about improvementsto the Accelerate framework,including support for new layer types in BNNS,as well as expanded C++ supportand other functionality in simd.h.I then gave you an introduction to the Apple Archiveand new Apple Encrypted Archive formatsand their support in the frameworks.Thank you and enjoy the rest of WWDC.♪
