SF Symbols in SwiftUI

What's new in UIKit

Search this video…Hi, I'm Tom, and I'd like to welcome youto "SF Symbols in UIKit and AppKit."Today I'm going to take you on a tour of how to implementthe new features of SF Symbols in your app.First, we're gonna go over the different color modesand how to use them.Then, we'll talk about how to combine configurationsto get the effects that you want.And finally, we're going to explore usingthese colored symbols in attributed strings.You will see examples that apply both to AppKit and UIKit.The new APIs are identical for both frameworks,so what applies to one, also applies to the other,with the exception of some framework-specific nuances.The new features center around adding colors to SF Symbols.While AppKit added multicolor symbols in macOS 11,UIKit is adding them in iOS 15.For this year's releases, additionalcolor rendering modes for SF Symbols are being added.And to be clear, these rendering modes work on all platforms.In order to support the new rendering modes,symbols now have different layers,each having a different color.These layers are defined in a hierarchy,meaning that one layer is more prominent than another.This means we've got three layers: primary,secondary, and tertiary.On iOS, symbols require template modefor the new rendering modes to take effect.On macOS, applying the new configurationswill automatically set the correct template mode.And if you're new to SF Symbols, check out"Introducing SF Symbols" from WWDC19.The first rendering mode we're going to look atare monochrome symbols.Here's a Voicemail app.In this UI, a couple symbols are being used.There's one monochrome symbol,and a few other symbols using a different color mode.But let's focus on the monochrome symbol first,and we'll come back to the others later.As the name implies,a monochrome symbol only has one color:usually the tint or accent color of the view.And in order to accomplish this result,we create a new symbol image,assign it to the image view, and set a tintor accent color to configure the color of the symbol.And nothing has changed here: we don't needany extra configuration to render a monochrome symbol,as it is the default behavior.So, monochrome was the only rendering modebefore iOS 15 and macOS 11.To specify a color, all we have to do is set the tintor accent color on the image view, and that's it.Now that we have the previously-existingmonochrome mode out of the way, we can talk about a new mode:hierarchical color symbols.A good example of hierarchical symbols on a Macare the icons used in Control Center.There are a few places where symbols are being usedin Control Center, but let's zoom in on the Display section.There are a few symbols being used here:the row of toggle buttons in the center,and the icons in the list of devices.The device symbols are tinted differentlythan the toggle buttons above them,and these are hierarchically-colored symbols.The hierarchical color modeuses the layer hierarchy of a symbol to color each layer,and the provided color is used as the primary layer color.The secondary and tertiary layersget variations of the primary colorwith progressively reduced opacity.You specify the color mode through a new typeof symbol configuration, which works exactly likethe existing types of symbol configurations.And by setting the symbol configuration of an imageViewto this type of configuration,the symbol will be displayed as a hierarchical color symbol.The color scheme of a hierarchical color symbolis based on one color, with the other colorsderived from that one color by reducing opacity.The layer hierarchy is important here.If one layer is missing,the associated derived color will not be used.There's also a third color rendering mode: palette.As we will discover, it's much like hierarchicalcolor rendering mode, but also different.Let's go back to our Voicemail example.The three buttons on the right each have multiple colors,and each have different colors.We're going to build these buttons one step at a time.First, we're gonna initialize our buttonswith the desired images.We're using a new button configuration for this.But these plain images isn't what we want at all.The images should have a circle shape and be filled in.We used to be able to do this by appendingthe desired modifiers to the symbol name,but now there's a better way: image variants.As the name implies, when using image variants,you can request a different variant of an imagewithout manually changing the name.First, let's turn our images into circles.Then, we'll add a nice fill to those circles.Since we are specifying the variantson the button container view, those variants areapplied to all the images in all the buttons.If an image doesn't have that variant,the originally-specified image will be used.The variant specification will propagate downthe view hierarchy, and the image viewin that hierarchy will pick them up to do their magic.Now that we have the shape out of the way,how do we specify the colors for each of these symbols?Well, we can create a new type of symbol configuration,one that specifies a palette of colors.These colors are applied to the layer hierarchysimilar to the hierarchical color configuration.But we're using colors here that are specifiedexplicitly versus using derived colors.And we're also using a new type of colorin the list of palette colors: tint color.This means that the view will automaticallyapply its tint color to the appropriate layer.And for the next button, we do exactly as before.Load the base image, build the right color configuration,and apply them to the button configuration.And in this case, it looks exactly the same as before,but there's a catch here, and I'll explain that later.And the same scenario also works for the last button,but just with different colors.And like before, you might wonder whywe explicitly have to specify white here.Couldn't we just use a monochrome symboland tint them correctly?The answer is no, we can't, and this is the catchI mentioned before.Our designer specified that the inner partsof these symbols should always be white.And up until now, we would've gottenthe correct result by accident,even when using monochrome symbols.Why? We were in light mode.But when we switch to dark mode,monochrome symbols do not give us the desired results.This is because the monochrome versionsuse knockouts for the inner parts,and so the background bleeds through the gaps.Now, by using a palette rendering mode,we make sure these buttons appear correctlyfor different user interface styles.I mentioned a new color before: tintColor.This is a new dynamic color in UIKit that willresolve to the tint color of the view it is used in.This is especially handy when specifying symbol layer colors,but you can also use this coloreverywhere where you can use any other color.However, keep in mind that the rulesaround dynamic colors still apply.See "Implementing dark mode on iOS" sessionof WWDC19 to learn more about how dynamic colors work.Some symbols only have two layers.For instance, there's a bunch of symbolsthat are missing a secondary layer.How do we handle palette mode for these kinds of symbols?A good example of these are the device symbols,which only have a primary layer and a tertiary layer.How do we color this iPad symbol with two layer colors?Since symbols can have up to three layers,you can just specify three colors, one for each layer.In this case, the secondary color is not usedbecause the layer isn't there.However, there's another way to do thisfor symbols with only two layers.For those symbols, we can specify just two colorsin your configuration, and the colors will beapplied to the available layers in sequence.The former methodallows for consistency on howto specify palette colorsfor related symbolswith a mixed number of layers,because the colors directly map to the correct layer.The latter method is a convenience for whenyou know for surethat the symbol only has two layers.The palette configurationspecifies an explicit set of colors that areapplied to the layer hierarchy of the symbol.Unlike the hierarchical rendering mode,the palette rendering mode doesn't create derived colors.And similar to hierarchical rendering mode,the hierarchy level of each symbol layer is important.There's also a convenient solutionfor symbols with less than three layers.This brings us to the last color rendering mode: multicolor.Like I mentioned before, this color modewas added to AppKit and SwiftUI last yearbut is introduced to UIKit this year.Some of these categories have images with multiple colors.These are multicolor symbols.Let's see how we would implement this.First of all, we need to load the images for each cell.For now, these are regular symbols,and we get the monochrome mode by default.Then we need to indicate that we want multicolor symbols.We do this by creating a configurationrequesting the multicolor variant of a symboland assigning that configuration to the image view.But one icon didn't change:its symbol does not support multicolor.So, how do you figure outwhich symbols support multicolor or not?An easy way to find out is to use the SF Symbols app.Search for the symbol, then use the inspector to seewhich color rendering modes the symbol supports.For instance, our flame symbol only supports monochrome.But the lung symbol supports all four color rendering modes.Additionally, you can also play with the color mappingfor each layer here,in order to get a better feel of how the symbol would appearwithout having to write one line of code.Let's go back to our example.So, since not all of these symbols support multicolor,we need to manually set the tintColor to the right valuein order for the symbol to display correctly.Some multicolor symbols have a tint layer,and they will be affected by the tintor accent color of the view.Symbols without such layer won't be affected.In our example, none of them do, so everything remains as is.As you might have guessed from the name of the configuration,the multicolor configuration indicatesa preference for a multicolor rendering of a symbol.As I mentioned before,not all symbols have a multicolor variant.You can combine a multicolor configurationwith one of the other color configurations,but more on that later.And the result is a configuration that supportstwo color modes: multicolor when it is available,and the other color mode otherwise.Note that combining hierarchical mode and palette modewill result in the last-specified mode,as they are mutually exclusive.If, in turn, that color mode is not supported,the system uses monochrome mode.So, multicolor symbols have a fixed set of colorswhich aren't modifiable in code.Additionally, some symbols have a layerthat will be rendered using the tint or accent color.And you don't have anything to do in order for this to work.The symbol picks up the right tint or accent colorfrom its imageview when it is displayed.Now, we've covered all four modesand how to use them in your code.But can we do the same in Interface Builder?Fortunately, the answer is yes.Xcode has added similar functionality to configurecolor rendering modes right from the IDE.Here we have Xcode Open displayinga storyboard for the Planets app.The ImageView UI has been expandedto enable specifying a color rendering mode.And the resulting color configuration is also combinablewith the previously-existing configurations.If you want to learn more about all these new featuresin Interface Builder, check out this year's"Build interfaces with style."Now that we have talked aboutall these different color modes, how can we combine themwith other configurations to get more complex effects?Luckily, it's not that hard.Let's check out another example,this time from the Shortcuts app.The icons of each of the actions are quite large,but they also appear to havea hierarchical color rendering mode.So, we need two configurations: one for specifying a point size,and one for specifying a color configuration.But we can only apply one.How do we combine them?Turns out there's an easy way to do this.There's a method to combine two configurations,resulting in a configurationthat has the elements of both configurations.In the example here, we create two configurations:one for specifying a point size,and another one for specifying a hierarchical color.We then combine them using the applying methodsto create a final configuration.And that configuration is applied on the image viewdisplaying the image, giving us the desired result.Note that this mechanismis not limited to color configurations only.You can also use thiswith the other types of configurations.For instance, combining text, style, and weight.Now we know how to combine different configurations.We've got one topic left:using color symbols in attributed strings.Take this last example.This is an imaginary app that lists various hotelsand information about their available rooms.There's a few places where symbolsare combined with text.But let's focus on the room amenitiesand how we would implement this text.It's fairly simple, but a bit elaborate.We have to build an attributed string with an image attachment.First, we load the image, using the correct color configuration.In this case, we're using a hierarchicalcolor configuration.We use this image to create a text attachment,and then we use that attachmentto complete our attributed string.And this is then repeated for all the available amenities.On the label displaying the text,we also specify the correct fontand the same text color as we usedfor the hierarchical color configurations.Monochrome symbols pick up the text color automatically,but for symbols with a color configuration,we have to specify the colors explicitly.And color symbols do pick up the font sizesspecified in the string, just like monochrome symbols.After these steps, we have the result that we want:a label with the right content, color, and size,thanks to the integration of symbols in attributed strings.We introduced three new color modes for SF Symbolsin addition to the existing one,and we explained how to use them in your app.Symbols are a great way to add high-quality images to your app.Colored symbols expand on that,allowing for even more possibilities.If you enjoyed this session, be
