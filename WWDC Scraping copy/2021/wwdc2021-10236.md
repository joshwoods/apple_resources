Search this video…Hi, my name is David, and I'm an engineeron the Documentation Tools team here at Apple.In this session, you'll learn abouthosting DocC documentationand automating documentation builds.First, I'll talk about building documentation in Xcodeand how you can hostthe built documentation archives on a server.Next, I'll go into more detailof how documentation builds workand how you can automate building documentation.Throughout this talk,I'll be showing you SlothCreator,a project that my colleagues and I have been working on.We made a website to help people get started.And now, we're really excited about usingthe new documentation features in Xcodeto build a version of our documentationthat we can host right on our website.That's going to make it even easierfor people to get started.So let's look at how we can accomplish that.The new documentation featuresin Xcode 13 makes it really easyto build documentationfor your Swift frameworks, libraries, and packages.You can start using it right awaywithout any setupand then expand your documentationwith additional material over time.And it's just as easyto export your documentationfrom the Developer Documentation window.You can share the exported documentationarchive with othersso that they can import and read the documentation in Xcode,or you can host the documentation archive online.If you want to learn more about documentation in Xcodeand about authoring documentation for your symbols,my colleagues Victoria and Ethantalk about just that in the"Meet DocC documentation in Xcode" session.In the second half of this presentation,I'll talk about how you can automate building documentationon the command line.But for now,I'll use the documentation archivethat I exported from Xcode to host on our server.The documentation archive itself is a containerthat holds all the datato both read the documentation in Xcodeand to host it online.It is structured as a single pageVue.js web appthat's used to renderboth your reference documentation and articlesand your rich and interactive tutorials.There are two different types of requeststhat the server needs to handleto host the documentation archive.Requests for documentation and tutorial pageswhere the request URL starts with/documentation/ or /tutorials/and requests for additional files and datathat is loaded by the web app,where the request URL matches the relative file pathfor one of the files in the documentation archive.Let's look at an example of the requeststhat make up a pageand how the server should respond to them.When a developer goes to read your hosted documentationand the browser requests a page,if the request starts with /documentation/ or /tutorials/then the server should respond with the index.html filethat's located in the documentation archive.That file references CSS and JavaScriptwithin the documentation archive,which the browser requests to load the rest of the web app.Once that is loaded,the web app requests the content for that pageand any images or other media that it references.Both the filesthat is referenced by the index.html fileand the content and media that is loaded by the web appuse request URLs that match the folder structureof the documentation archive.Now that you've seen how the hosting serverneeds to respond to incoming requests,let's look at that in a demo.Many of you may already have a serverthat hosts your website.For our project, we're using an Apache server,but you can use any server that allows for custom routing.This is our website about SlothCreator.We've added this "Read Documentation" buttonbelow the introductory text in the center of the page,but the button doesn't work just yet.So let's fix that.I've already copied the documentation archiveinto the directory where we're hosting our websiteand added an empty .htaccess file.But I haven't set up any of the routing in it.There are two routing rules that I need to add:one for the documentation and tutorial pagesand one for the additional files and data.For the first rule,the pattern that I want to matchis any URL that starts with "documentation" or "tutorials"as its first path component.Any request that matches this pattern,I want to reroute to the index.html filewithin the documentation archive.Lastly, I'll end the rule with a flagto stop evaluating rulesif the request matches this rule.For the second rule,I'm going to be more explicit about the pattern.Since we're also hosting our website with this server,we don't want to reroute requestsfor the website to files in the documentation archive.If I look inside of the documentation archive,you can see that there are a handfulof top-level files and foldersthat I can match in a pattern.So I'll add a pattern that matches all of those.In this case, the request URLis a relative file path for one of the filesin the documentation archive,so I'll reroute the request to the matched patternbut prefixed with SlothCreator.doccarchive.And just like before,I added the same flag to stop evaluating rules.Now, if I reload the webpageand click on the documentation link,you'll see that the server now hostsboth our website and our documentation.The main SlothCreator pagegroups important symbols into topicsrelated to higher level tasks.And each of those group related symbolsinto more specific topics.DocC comes with a built-in, clean designthat's made to fit in well with a variety of projects.This makes it really easy to have good-looking,elegant documentation for your projects,like our SlothCreator documentation here.Now that we host a copy of our documentationon our website,let's look at how to automatebuilding and updating the documentation archive.To do that, I'm going to write a scriptthat calls xcodebuild.Once I have a script that does this,I can run it whenever new changes are madeso that the hosted documentationis always up to date.New in Xcode 13,you can build documentation on the command linewith xcodebuild's new docbuild action.When you build documentation in Xcode or xcodebuild,it works like a standard buildthat also builds documentation.During the build,the Swift compiler gathers detailed informationabout all the public symbols, their relationships,and in-source documentation commentsand passes this as a file called a symbol graphto the documentation compilerto produce a documentation archivewith all the necessary datato both read the documentation in Xcodeand to host it online.If the target has an associated documentation catalogwith additional articles, media, or tutorials for your project,then the documentation compileris going to combine all of that contentwith the symbol informationwhen it produces the documentation archive.If you want to learn moreabout documentation catalogs, check outthe "Elevate your DocC documentation in Xcode" sessionwhere my colleagues Bea and Jacktalk about the different types of documentationand how you can leverage each of themto offer developers a great wayfor learning about your project.Building documentation doesn't just apply to your targets.If your target has dependencies to other Swift frameworks,libraries, or packages,then the same process is applied to all of those as wellso that you get all the relevant documentation for your projectall in one place.Since I'm looking to automate building and updatingour hosted documentation with a script,xcodebuild on the command lineis going to be perfect for that.The new docbuild action in xcodebuildworks just like the default build action,but it also builds documentation.Like the build action,you pass it the scheme that you want to buildand the project or workspace that it's a part of.You can also call xcodebuildfrom within the directory that contains your project,workspace, or Swift packageand only pass it the scheme.Depending on your project and scheme,you may want to pass other flagssuch as sdk, destination, or configurationto customize how your project is built.It's not required to do so.But to make it more easy to follow,I'll specify a custom derivedDataPath,where the build products and the built documentationwill be written.After the build has completed,I can find all of the built documentation archivesusing the .doccarchive file extensionand copy each of themto another location or to another machine.Let's take a look at that in a demo.This is our hosted documentation from before.It groups related symbols into topicsso that it's easy for developersto find the core types for a specific task.In the time since we built this version,my colleagues have added some new articlesand tutorials that appear in the Essentials section.So now is a great time for me to write that automation scriptthat builds the latest documentationand updates our website.Like you just saw,we build documentationby calling xcodebuild's docbuild actionand update our website by finding and copyingthe documentation archive into the directorywhere we're hosting our website from.I already know what scheme I need to passbecause it's the same as I see in the scheme selector in Xcode.If I didn't already have Xcode open,I could also run xcodebuild -liston the command line to list all of the available schemes.Again, the custom derivedDataPathis not required, but it makes it easier to followwhere the built documentation is written and found.After the build has completed,I can find all of the documentation archivesand copy each of them into the directorywhere we're hosting our website from.And with that done, I'm ready to run the script.Now, if I refresh,you can see the added article and tutorialin the Essentials section.With these latest changes,our documentation looks more complete.And people who are new to SlothCreatorhave a great place to get started,whether they prefer the content of an articleor the step-by-step instructions in one of our tutorials.Now, updating our hosted documentationis as easy as running a script.And if we run it as part of a post-merge hookon our continuous integration server,then we can ensure that our hosted documentationalways stays up to date.To recap what we talked about in this session,you can share documentation archivesor host them onlineto give a great documentation experienceto consumers of your framework,even before they've started using it in Xcode.And building documentation on the command lineallows you to include documentationin your automation workflows.If you want to learn more about DocC documentation,"Meet DocC documentation in Xcode"is a fantastic introductionto the new documentation features in Xcode."Elevate your DocC documentation in Xcode"goes deep into how you can enhanceyour documentation with DocC catalogs.And "Build interactive tutorials using DocC"details how you can structure your
