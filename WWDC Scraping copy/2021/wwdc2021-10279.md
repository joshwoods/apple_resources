My name is Caleb.I'm a software engineer on the tvOS team.Today, I'm excited to share some great improvementswe've made to sign-ins in tvOS 15.We want everyone using Apple TVto be able to get to their content quickly,and with as little friction as possible.That means the process of signing in to your appsshould be fluid and painless.One of the most common ways to sign inis by using a password.Users are encouraged to have strong or unique passwords,but these can be frustrating to type.In tvOS 15, we have a great new featurethat makes it easier than ever to performpassword-based sign-ins in your apps.It starts with the new system sign-in view.This view does a few really important things.First, it provides a consistent sign-in experience across tvOS.Second, it tells users they can use their iPhoneor iPad to complete the sign-in.Third, it gives users options for other sign-in typesyour app may support.I'll talk more about that later.For now, I wanna focus on using your iPhone or iPad to sign in.If a user begins a sign-in in your app,then wakes their iPhone,they'll see a notification like this from the Apple TV.When they tap the notification, iPhone will guide themthrough the process of signing in.It will suggest a credential from iCloud Keychain.And they can use Face ID to confirm the sign-in.The credential is then sent back to the Apple TV.Now, the app can finish the sign-inand take the user right to their content.I want to take a moment to point outthat this is not a text-entry experience.It's a first-class sign-in experience,where both the Apple TV and the iPhone or iPadcooperate to guide the user through the sign-in process.Adopting this new sign-in experience is really easy.There's a high-level API on all Apple platformsthat's designed to help people sign in to your apps.It's especially powerful in tvOS 15.With just a little bit of code, you can take full advantageof the great sign-in experience I just showed you.I'd love to walk you through it now.Let's start with configuring your app's associated domains.Associated domains establish a secure linkbetween your app and domain.This allows the Apple TV and the iPhone or iPadto work together to safely suggestcredentials to use for signing in.First, make sure the Apple app site association filehosted by your domain lists your tvOS app'sapplication identifier inside the web credentials key.Next, add the Associated Domain capabilityto your tvOS app in Xcode.And finally, add your domainto the Associated Domains capabilitywith the web credentials prefix.To learn more about configuringweb credentials domains in your apps,see the "Introducing Password AutoFill for Apps" videofrom WWDC 2017.Next, I'd like to show you how to requesta credential using AuthenticationServices.Let's take a look at some code.Here we have the basic ingredientsneeded to request a credential.If you're already using the AuthenticationServices APIin your iOS or macOS apps,this code should look very familiar.I'll start by creating an instanceof ASAuthorizationController with a password request.Something really powerful about this APIis that it lets you specifymultiple different kinds of requests.If your app also supports Sign in with Apple,you may include an Apple ID requestin the authorization requests array.When you specify multiple requests,iPhone and iPad will let the user decidewhich type of credential they would like to useto sign in.Next, I'll set myselfas the delegate of the authorization controllerand call performRequests to start the sign-in.Now, I need to implement a few methodsfrom ASAuthorization- ControllerDelegate.When the user has selected a credentialthey want to use on their iPhone or iPad,the system will call didCompleteWithAuthorization.Now, I can use the user and password propertieson the credential to finish the sign-in.If the sign-in fails, the system will call didCompleteWithError.If the user canceled the sign-in,I'll return from this method so the app can go backto the main sign-in UI.Otherwise, I should let the user knowsomething went wrong and that they should try again.Next, I'd like to show you how you can customizethe system sign-in view.The custom authorization methods API allows you to showbuttons for other sign-in types your apps may support.The ".other" value provides a great deal of flexibility.You may use this option to navigate directlyto a manual sign-in flow,like asking for a username and password.Or you may use it to navigate to your own UIthat allows the user to selecta different type of sign-in to perform.If your app allows users to sign inusing their TV provider account, you should usethe .videoSubscriberAccount value.And finally, the .restorePurchase valueallows users to sign in by restoring an in-app purchase.When the user selects one of thesecustom authorization methods, it is up to your appto begin the requested sign-in flow.Let's take a look at how this works.First, I'll go back to the ASAuthorizationController codeI showed you earlier.In order to show custom sign-in options,I'll set the customAuthorizationMethodsproperty on my authorization controller.In this example, I'm using the .otherand .restorePurchase values to display "Sign in Manually"and "Restore Purchase" buttons in the system sign-in view.You should choose the valuesthat are appropriate for your app.When the user selects a custom authorization method,the system will call didCompleteWithCustomMethodon my authorizationController delegate.In this method, I can check the value that was passed inand perform the type of sign-in that the user requested.Finally, I want to take a momentto talk about some best practices.The best sign-in experience on tvOSstarts with a single "Sign In" button.It guides the user through the sign-in process,offering a limited number of clear choices.By replacing your existing sign-in experiencewith the new system sign-in view,users will always have the option to sign inwith their iPhone or iPad.And the custom authorization methods API is a great wayfor you to offer your users additional sign-in options.tvOS 15 makes it easier than everto build great sign-in experiences.The system sign-in view allows usersto sign-in with their iPhone or iPad.And the powerful new API in AuthenticationServicesmakes it easy for you to get started.For a more in-depth look at some of the examples I sharedin this presentation, see the sample code projectfor this session in the developer app.To learn more about how the AuthenticationServicesframework can help you build great sign-in experiencesacross all Apple platforms,see the "What's new in Authentication" videofrom WWDC 2019.Thanks for watching, and enjoy the conference![upbeat music]
