Embrace Expected Failures in XCTest

Search this videoâ€¦Hello and welcome to WWDC.I'm Jeremy Goldman, an engineer on the XCTest team.In this session, we're going to exploresome exciting new ways to interact with devicesfrom UI Tests in Xcode 13.In particular, we're going to focuson three new interactionsacross three different platforms:the iPadOS Pointer,the watchOS Digital Crown,and the macOS trackpad.Let's start with the iPadOS Pointer.In iPadOS 13.4,Apple introduced mouse and trackpad support,providing users with a brand new wayto interact with iPad,using accessories like the Magic Keyboard.Many developers have taken full advantage of thisby adding pointer-specific behavior and interactionsto their iPad apps,like custom hover animations.In Xcode 13,we're providing a powerful new APIfor controlling the iPadOS Pointer in UI Tests.This API will enable you to create robust automated testsfor multiple types of pointer interactionsin your iPad appsand will be available for usewith devices running iPadOS 15 and later.Let's examine this new API in more detail.First, we're adding a new property on XCUIDeviceto indicate whether or nota device supports pointer interaction.Next, we're adding new methods on XCUIElementfor performing different pointer interactions,like hovering, multiple types of clicking,and two-finger scrolling.We're also adding methodsfor more advanced click-and-drag use casesas well as a class method for executing blocks of codewith one or more modifier keys held down.These methods are also available on XCUICoordinate,if additional precision is required.Let's explore how these new APIs work in practiceby creating a new UI Test for a pointer interactionin an iOS app.In this demo, I'll be using the Fruta app,which has a sidebarthat's initially hidden on launch.I recently added pointer-specific functionalityon iPad, where a horizontal two-finger trackpad swipeopens the sidebar.Let's add a UI Test for that.Here I have an empty UI Test class,which is where I'll add my new UI Test.Let's quickly walk through what this test is doing.It starts by launching the appand then asserting that the sidebaris not initially present on launch.Then it performs a horizontal two-finger trackpad swipeand asserts that the sidebar is now present.One other thing I'd like to point outis this availability attributeI've added on the test method.This is necessary whenever you're using methodsthat are only available starting with a specific iOS version.In this case, the pointer interaction APIswere introduced in iOS 15.0.Let's try running the test on the iPad simulator.You can follow along with the cursor indicator,which is the dark circlenear the bottom left corner of the screen.Great! It looks like our test works on iPad.However, this app is also available on iPhone,which does not support pointer interaction.Let's try running this test on the iPhone simulator.So it appears the test failedwith an error message that"Pointer events are not supported on this device."To resolve this, we need to modify our testso that it only executes on devicesthat do support pointer interaction.We can do this by usingXCTSkipUnless with the newsupportsPointerInteraction property on XCUIDeviceto skip the test on unsupported devices, instead of failing.Now let's try running the test on the iPhone simulator again.Perfect. So now this test will be skippedon devices that don't support pointer interaction.Let's talk about some new waysto interact with devices on other platforms,more specifically, watchOS and the Digital Crown.As you may already know,Xcode 12.5 introduced UI Testing supportfor watchOS apps.This support includes methods newly available on watchOSfor synthesizing touch eventsas well as hardware button events,like clicking the crown.In Xcode 13, we're expanding this supportwith a new methodfor synthesizing Digital Crown rotation.This method requires just one parameter,the number of rotations,and has an optional velocity parameterto specify the speed at which the crown should be rotated.This velocity parameter has type XCUIGestureVelocity,which means you can either use one of the preset values,like slow, fast, and default,or you can specify a custom decimal valuein rotations per second.Let's see how this new method works in practice.Say I have a simple weather app for watchOSthat displays the current temperature outside.The app has a featurewhere users can scroll the digital crown forwardto see forecasted temperatures at future timesor scroll backwardto see the recorded temperature at past times.Let's walk through a basic UI Testthat makes sure this crown rotation functionalitybehaves as expected.The test starts by launching the appand then asserting that the forecast time labelinitially says Current Temperature.Then, we rotate the digital crown one full rotation forward,and assert the label updated to say "One hour from now."After that, we rotate the crown two full rotations backward,and the test finishes by assertingthat the label updated to say "One hour ago."Finally, let's talk about the macOS trackpad.More specifically, let's focus on scrolling.Scrolling can be broken down into two different categories:discrete and continuous.Discrete scrolling has precise incremental movement.Think about rotating the scroll wheelon a physical mouse.The on-screen content moves in uniform incrementsfor each tick on the scroll wheel,and the movement is non-inertial,meaning it stops moving immediatelywhen you stop rotating the scroll wheel.On the other hand, continuous, or phased scrolling,has fluid and dynamic movement.Picture swiping with two fingers on a trackpad.The on-screen contentscrolls smoothly while you're swiping,and the movement is inertial,meaning it continues moving after you lift your fingers offuntil it gradually comes to a stop.XCTest currently provides a scroll method on macOSthat enables you to perform discrete pixel-precise scrollingin your UI Tests.This method requires two parametersto specify the exact horizontal and vertical distancein pixels to scroll.In Xcode 13, we're introducing new methodsfor synthesizing continuous or trackpad-like scrollingon macOS.These methods accept an optional velocity parameterto specify the speed at which you'd like to scroll.This velocity parameter has type XCUIGestureVelocitywhich means, just like inthe rotateDigitalCrown method we explored earlier,you can either use the presetsor you can specify a custom decimal valuein pixels per second.Xcode 13 introduces APIs across multiple platformsto enable automation of new input methodsand provide support for more specialized use cases.Use this new functionality to create UI Testsfor pointer-specific interactions in your iPad apps,automate digital crown rotation in your watchOS UI Tests,and perform continuous, trackpad-like scrolling on macOSwith the new swipe methods.If you're interested in learning more,make sure to check out these related sessions.Thanks for watching and enjoy the rest of WWDC.[music]

XCTest currently provides a scroll method on macOSthat enables you to perform discrete pixel-precise scrollingin your UI Tests.This method requires two parametersto specify the exact horizontal and vertical distancein pixels to scroll.

In Xcode 13, we're introducing new methodsfor synthesizing continuous or trackpad-like scrollingon macOS.These methods accept an optional velocity parameterto specify the speed at which you'd like to scroll.This velocity parameter has type XCUIGestureVelocitywhich means, just like inthe rotateDigitalCrown method we explored earlier,you can either use the presetsor you can specify a custom decimal valuein pixels per second.

Xcode 13 introduces APIs across multiple platformsto enable automation of new input methodsand provide support for more specialized use cases.

Use this new functionality to create UI Testsfor pointer-specific interactions in your iPad apps,automate digital crown rotation in your watchOS UI Tests,and perform continuous, trackpad-like scrolling on macOSwith the new swipe methods.If you're interested in learning more,make sure to check out these related sessions.
