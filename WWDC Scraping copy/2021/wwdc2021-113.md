Designing Award Winning Apps and Games

Search this video…♪ ♪Design is one of the most challenging thingsthat you can do in software.You have to identify the problem really well.♪ ♪Oh!Design can be certainly how something looks,but we are really preoccupied with how something works.App and game design enables our deviceto be what it is and what it can becomein your hands.♪ ♪Designing an app or a gameis actually quite an intimate experience.I need to empathize.I need to have some-- try and understandwhat your experience might be like using that thing.The person on the other sidereally can feel the attention and carethat's been put into it, but the challenge thereis simplifying it so that somebody can lookat something and just, like,you know, understand immediately.Developers, the ones that figure out a wayto achieve these things in their designare the ones that usually stand out.♪ ♪For us to celebrate the best of the best,those apps that were designed in such a waythat are deserving of an Apple Design Award,you know, nothing is biggerin this community, in our community.It's always easy to rememberthe really big moments in life,and winning an Apple Design Awardwas definitely one of those momentsthat I'll never forget.I mean, I had to pinch myself,like, really hard to be assured that I'm not dreaming.Pretty much everyone that win Apple Design Awardis somebody who has made somethingthat I would use or play.It really gave the team a chance to pause and reflectand acknowledge all that we'd accomplished.It's elevated it to this other levelwhere we've just got a lot more users,and we get a ton of feedback from peoplein all different countries.I can't say it's more like a dream come truebecause I-- this was beyond my dreamand really can't express those things.This year with the Apple Design Awards,we're bringing back categories.There are six categoriesfor the Apple Design Awards this year.-They're inclusivity. - Delight and fun.- Interaction. - Social impact.- Visuals and graphics. - And innovation.The thing that I love about what we're doing this yearis that we're able to really zero inon some particular qualitiesthat are really important and to talk about them directly.♪ ♪Apps and games are hugely powerfulbecause they can create environments where, you know,all are welcome.♪ ♪Design is inherently aboutunderstanding and catering towards people,so this idea of inclusivity, it's not anything new,but it is just making sure that the goalis always to support more people,to enable more people.Well, obviously ethnicity and age and genderare some of the big ones, but all the time,we're finding more thingsthat are personally important to people.Being inclusive and being diverseis being accepting of those categoriesand making sure that they're representedin a way that's equitable to the user.Apps and games that excel at inclusivityinclude as many people as possible in the experience.This can be done through localizationwith a ton of languages.It can be done by supporting a wide varietyof accessibility features like voiceover and dynamic type.It can be something as simple as turning on reduced motionin a game so people with motion sensitivitiescan still have fun and experience the game fully.♪ ♪The winning app in the Inclusivity categoryis Voice Dream Reader.Voice Dream Reader makes it so easy to bring text to speech.Mr. Bennet was so odd.A mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humor,reserve, and caprice...It has probably one of the best implementationsof voiceover that we have ever seen.It has a lot of text customization settings,so it can increase contrast or decrease contrast,space out lines, words, and highlight certain phraseswithin a written material to make it easy for peoplewho may have low vision or dyslexia,and it's also localized into 26 different languages.This year's winner in Inclusivity in gamesis "HoloVista.""HoloVista" is a mixed reality gamewhere you use the gyroscope to photographthese really beautiful 3D spaces."HoloVista" has a pretty thorough setof accessibility controls that make itso that you can control text legibility,color legibility, motion sensitivity,and the way that you want to control the cameraas you're panning around or not.This app has got some really great visual warningsabout potential sensory and cognitive needs.It's also very good at presenting those controlsand those warnings upfront.♪ ♪It's easy to know what it feels liketo be delighted and to have fun.Putting it into words is a lot more difficult.It's an interesting one because you can feel delighthaving an experience with a more serious app or game,or you can have delight and funwith, obviously, a game that's just fun to play.Delight and fun is when you use all of the toolsat your disposal in an unexpected way.I think the reason that it's importantis because it's really memorable for people.People understand that using the appthat time kind of brightened up your day.They're gonna return to itand use it again and again and again.For a game, what really stands outin terms of delight and fun a lot of the timeare these moments in the game.Maybe it's something that catches you by surpriseand just creates this little moment of,like, "Oh, I love that."People are seeking experienceswhere they can escape a lot of the time,things that might make you laugh,make you smile, and just have fun.The winner for Delight and Fun for gamesis "Little Orpheus."My mission was clear, to find Little Orpheus."Little Orpheus" is just such a delight to play.And deep below the Earth's surface,prehistoric monsters still roam freely.There's these little moments in the gamethat just have to get you.Everything from the music--the character's story is wonderful.It's like a Jules Verne novel come to life.Perhaps Little Orpheus was not lost at all.This year's winner in the Delight and Fun categoryfor apps is "Pok Pok."It is just the definition of a joyful experience.The first time I played with this app,I honestly spent over an hour just fiddlingwith all of the different little sandbox toys,and I know it's meant to be designed for children,but it definitely brings out kind of this childlike wonder.The thing that I really loved about itwas that this app came from a mother and father,them just wanting to build somethingthat was delightful for their children.It puts a smile on everyone's faceswhen they use it, and it's just the clear winner here.♪ ♪If I poke you, there is a reaction, right?There's an action and reaction,and that dance is where interaction stands.Ooh, look, parallax.Interaction is all about how an app or a game works,how the user relates to it,how they make their way through the applicationand experience it.In our world, nothing's more critical.Interaction always has a result to what you doeven if the result is letting you knownothing happened.Apps that stand out in the Interaction categoryare extraordinarily easy to use.They are kind of using the right methods of input,so whether that's keyboard or jester or pencil.If design can almost-- can get out of the wayof someone's intention of what they are trying to do,that's almost where it's best design.You don't think about the app,or you don't think about roadblocks in the app,and you don't think about anything else really.It becomes invisible.When you're interacting with a game,and you are just seamlessly moving,and you're not thinking, "I'm moving my left thumb up.I am moving my right thumb down."It's just--it is intuitive.You just understand what you're gonna need to do.You feel like you're at onewith the device that you're holding,and it just becomes second nature.The winner in the Interaction categoryfor apps is CARROT Weather.I think the real magic of it is in the way that it manifestsin the other places in my life that I need.CARROT Weather allows me to put a widget on the home screen.I can also go in, add-- oh, there's four faces.To add any one of these four faces,and just add it to my watch, and there it is.Can you show us?Yeah.What I love about CARROT Weather is just how much its personalityinfuses every part of the experience.Depending on your outlook on life,it's either partly cloudy or partly sunny.So if you do like your forecasts snarky,you can set it for snarky.If you want them a bit more professional,you can dial it down a little bit.And now all the way up.Okay.Well, there may be unprintable words in there,but we'll see.The winner in the games categoryfor Interaction is "Bird Alone.""Bird Alone" won the interaction categorybecause it is so easy to use.You instantly know what you're doingwhen you launch the game. You know where to tap.You know where to swipe.I really like the balancebetween a story that's being toldand then engaging me and asking me to do a task.So I just drew a pictureof something that makes me happy.You're able to explore a little bit,and if you touch onscreen, you're given visual feedback.What's really unique is that it only asks youto interact with the game a little bit at a time.So you can only play for a little bit per day,which is such a different spinon what games typically are asking you to do.♪ ♪I think being a developerand being a creator in general, we have the responsibilityof making sure that the things that we create,the tools that we make are helpingmake the world a better place.Social impact to me represents an awarenessthat we have a responsibilityto do things for others in our community.I mean, I think a lot of people, hopefully, share that sense,This is when, like, technology is at its best--when it's used to amplify people's voicesand voices that are not often heard.I think there's lots of ideas still out thereabout how technology can impact social change.A couple ways that we think about social impactis does it improve lives in meaningful ways?Does it have lasting value or impacton the community as a whole?The winning app in the Social Impact categoryis Be My Eyes.Be My Eyes wonbecause it's so clearthe benefit that's being provided,that you're there as a volunteer at least.to help someone who can't see identify objects around them.There's just countless stories of humans helping humansthat I think it just resonates deeply with us.This year, we saw several gamestake a really active approach toward social impact,which is not something we've seen in previous years,at least to the degree we've seen this year.The winner of the Social Impact category for gamesis "Alba: a Wildlife Adventure."♪ ♪"Alba: a Wildlife Adventure"is just a tremendously charming gamewith incredible personality.It follows a young girl who's 11 years oldwho's trying to save this natural preserveas the city is trying to build a resorton top of the natural preserve.She learns to pick up trash in the local community,start a petition to help out the area.She takes pictures of wildlife and then repairs the signsaround the natural preserve so that people beginto take interest in the natural preserve again.All of these things contribute to this incredibly charming,terrific experience.♪ ♪The visuals and the graphicsare the front door into an experience.♪ ♪Visuals and graphics are at the coreof design and at the core of communication,so as developers and as we as designerswant to communicate, we do it through visuals.♪ ♪You haven't read anything, done anything,really interacted with it, but just through colorsthat you're seeing, the style of the icons,the choice of typeface, if it's a game,the quality of the graphics, the 3D models,how they're rendered, what the frame rate is.All of these things tell you so muchabout the experience that you're about to have.The winning app in the category of Visuals and Graphicsis Loóna♪ ♪Start with its tailand slowly color the dragon's body.Loóna is a appthat helps you slow down, calm down, forget about thingsthat are stressing you out, and just focuson coloring in a model while hearinga really nice story told by a really talented voice actor,and it just helps to relax and maybe help you fall asleep.Wonderful.The winner for visuals and graphics for gamesis "Genshin Impact."There's just so many things to see in this game.These huge, beautiful vistas looking out over the terrainor inside temples and seeing the special effectsfor the magic and combat encounters.The look of the characters themselvesand how they have this anime quality to themthat really fits the style of the game.Huh? Look at that!♪ ♪I've always seen innovationas the association of remote ideas,and they come together into somethingthat is both familiar because they were already existing ideasbut also something new because the combinationhas never been here before.It's not new for new's sake.It's not technology for technology's sake.It's a new way of solving an old problem.If you can remove frictionfrom something and make it just a little bit easier,that is really innovative.The trick to, I think, fostering good ideasis this state of openness.Apps are not a monolith.They keep evolving with the world and with people.When I use an innovative app,my first reaction is "This can't be possible,"or, "Why hasn't it always worked like this?"The winner in the innovation category for appsis NaadSadhana.What really distinguished it--it's not only a music practicing app,but it's also a music improvisation app,and it's for Indian classical singing.Giving me real-time feedback about whetherI'm hitting the notes or not.♪ This is NaadSadhana ♪♪ It is the winning app ♪I'm currently not hitting the notes.♪ Hey, yeah, yeah ♪That's definitely not on pitch.But it's also using the tone of your voiceand the intensity of your singing voiceto adapt the rhythm, so as you sing more intensely,the rhythm gets more intense.♪ ♪The winner in the innovation categoryfor games is "League of Legends: Wild Rift."It's an incredible achievementto bring the full-fledged "League of Legends" experienceto Apple's platforms.  Yeah, wow.The motion is very, very fluid. I love it.MOBAs--multiplayer online battle arenas--are incredibly complex, and "League of Legends"has a lot of nuance within that category,and to be able to bring that to iOSand not only fit it on iPhone and the iPadbut also be able to thrive on that platformis a terrific achievement.Oh, I was slain.All right, let's do this again.One of the really challenging thingsis bringing the controlsof a multiplayer online battle arenalike "League of Legends" to a touchscreenand a smaller form factor like an iPhone.But they do a terrific job with customized controls.Really interesting things like being ableto swipe an ability up to the cornerto cancel it mid-battle, and it allows youto have all the nuanced gameplay you would expectfrom "League of Legends" on a touchscreen,which is terrific.Victory.To anyone that's interestedin being a developer, I would encourage youto find the things you're passionate about.Find a thing that you want to create.Try things. Try again.Have the courage to go down a pathand turn round if it's not right.Being wrong, I think,is most of the process.Just accepting that is kind of hard at first,but, like, super freeing once you know that.I wish that somebody would tell methat this is gonna be a life journey.I just wanted to say congratulationsto all of the winners and thank you.I just want to thank you so much.Thank you so much.You know, when I won many years ago,it had a huge impact on me and my career,so I hope it does the same for you.Thank you for being out thereelevating the human experience.And we're so happy that you put your hard workinto the world.I'm not sure what the future holdsfor great apps and great games, but I am positivethere's a developer who's already building it.♪ ♪
