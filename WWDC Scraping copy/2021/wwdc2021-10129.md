What’s new in managing Apple devices

Search this video…My name is Lucy Zhang, and I'm a software engineeron the Installation and Software Update team.I'll be talking about managed software updatesfor macOS, iOS, and iPadOS today.Software updates are critical to everyoneusing Apple products.Updates bring new security enhancements,like notarization and the sealed system volumein macOS Big Sur.They enable all the latest features,and maybe most importantly,that's how you get all the new emojis.Our platform makes it easy to update your device.In fact, 86% of all iPhones introducedin the last four years use iOS 14.However, in managed environments,you need more control over this process.When managing a fleet of devices,you want to keep them up to date,but you need time to test updates before releasing them,to ensure that the OS is compatible with your software.After your testing is complete, you want to ensure thatupdates are installed as soon as possible,while minimizing disruption to the user.In this session, we will first explorethe programs and restrictions that allow you to testbeta and newly released software updates.Next, the MDM commands for deploying updates.And finally, I can't wait to tell you abouta new way you can ensure users get updatedto the latest version you're ready to support.Let's get started with testing updates.When Apple releases a beta OS, you have time and tools to testthe OS in your environment before it's released.AppleSeed for IT help you access and testnew Apple software while it's in beta.Any non-student Managed Apple ID from Apple School Manageror Apple Business Manager can participate in the program,which gives you access to pre-release Apple softwarefor testing in your environment,and includes detailed test plans and a way to provide feedback.Once the update is publicly released,you may still need time to test,and you don't want the update to be availableto all your users yet.For that, you have deferral.Deferral prevents supervised devicesfrom offering software updates to users,until a specified period of time has expiredsince those updates were published by Apple.When you apply a deferral restriction,the default delay is 30 days since update publication.You can also specify a custom value between 1 and 90 days.When an update has been available long enoughfor the specified delay to expire,that update is offered to users as part of the standardsoftware update notifications and update process.These restrictions give you more granular controlover the Software Update interface in System Preferences.The deferred updates restriction only affectsthe Software Update interface.It does not change the behavior of MDM commands.Even with a restriction set, MDM has the abilityto send specific updates to devices.For iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, deferring software updatesis available in iOS 11.3 or later,iPadOS 13.1 or later,and tvOS 12.2 or later.When you defer updates, you set the same deferral windowfor major and minor updates.For Mac computers, deferring software updatesis available in macOS 10.13 or later.In macOS 11.3 or later, an admin may now choose to delaymajor releases for longer than minor releases.That way, users can still benefit fromimportant security updates, while the admin worksto approve the latest major release for productionin their environment.These are the keys that you can set in a profileto install on the Mac computer.Use the forceDelayedMajorSoftwareUpdateskey to defer a major release.With this key, you can still receive minor OSand security updates, while deferring a major OS update.There may be times where you want to separatelydefer a minor release, and you'll usethe forceDelayedSoftwareUpdates key to do that.And for separately deferringsupplemental updates, you'll use theforceDelayedAppSoftwareUpdates key.If a deferral type is enabled, but there is no correspondingdeferral period set, we will fallback to usingthe old key, ManagedDeferredInstallDelay.When there are deferral restrictions in place,this is how the software update preference paneappears on macOS.Let's explore how deferral might work.Back to the timeline, you've now deferredan update and continued testing the new OSfor compatibility in your environment.Once you've confirmed the OS and completed testing,you're ready to push it to users.You want devices to update when users are ready,and it's not intrusive to their workflow.So let's explore deploying updates.There are a few steps to install the right updateon the right device, and with macOS Monterey,there's more parity than ever before between macOS and iOS.The first step in deploying updates for all platformsis to check for updates and confirm device eligibility.Here's how that was done for Mac prior to macOS Monterey.Available OS updates were only able to beevaluated on the user's device.You used the command ScheduleOSUpdateScan,which tells the Mac to query the serverfor available OS updates, and then evaluates the updatesto determine eligibility.Once the scan finished and was sent back to the MDM server,the MDM could then choose an update to deploy.However, Apple provides the Apple Software Lookup service,which provides a list of available OS versionsacross platforms.Here, we are presented with the iOS devices.You may already be using the feed for iPhoneand iPad to reduce the back-and-forth that comeswith the ScheduleOSUpdateScan for Mac.For iOS, MDM solutions use theApple Software Lookup Service to be aware of available updatesto push the command directly to the device.Here's how:First, the MDM Server can get a listof available updates, such as 12.1 or 12.2,from the Apple Software Lookup Service.When you're ready to deploy an update, the MDM serverwill send the update version to the device.Then, the device will reach the software update serverto verify that the update is eligibleand begin to download and install it.New with macOS Monterey, we are unifying this processfor macOS and iOS.We now support a new DeviceInformation query keycalled SoftwareUpdateModelID,which returns the hardware model string for iOSand macOS to MDM.The Apple Software Lookup Service will includethe appropriate hardware identifier for macOS,allowing MDM servers to determine the applicabilityof an update without the AvailableOSUpdates command.Just like on iOS, the MDM will be ableto determine update applicabilityby comparing the result from DeviceInformation queryto the device IDs listed in the JSON feed.Also, until now, macOS has ignored the ProductVersion keyand used ProductKey instead.As of macOS Monterey, the ProductVersion keywill be supported on macOS.iOS already uses this key to specify updates.For compatibility, if you specify both ProductVersionand ProductKey, then ProductKey will be used.If the device can't find an update eligiblefor that version, it will send the appropriate response.This removes the round trip for minor OS updatesas long as you have previously collectedthe supported device ID of the device.MDM administrators can automatically installand authorize software updates for macOS, iOS,and iPadOS, as long as the device is supervised.In macOS 11 or later, all Mac computers enrolledusing either Device Enrollmentor Automated Device Enrollment are supervised.For iOS and iPadOS, the user will be requiredto enter their passcode to proceed with the update.Mac computers with Apple siliconintroduce the concept of "ownership."Ownership can loosely be defined as the userwho has first claimed a Mac for configuring it for their useand is not tied to true legal ownership or chain of custody.Ownership defines who is authorized to make changesto the startup security policy for a specific install of macOS.On Apple silicon, the startup security policydefines the restrictions around which versionsof macOS can boot on Mac computers and permissionto use the bootstrap token for automated updates.macOS requires authentication to perform updates.For Mac computers with Apple silicon,authentication requires a user passwordor an MDM bootstrap token.A user password is required for user-initiated,interactive updates through System Preferences.An MDM Bootstrap Token is used for automatednon-interactive updates,which requires macOS 11.2 or later,and the update being installed must be signed by Apple.New in macOS Monterey, we have introduced supportfor the bootstrap tokenfor MDM-initiated install-later flows.This means that Apple silicon devices can scheduleand perform updates at a later time,when the device is not in use.Your users will appreciate that you're updatingtheir device while not disrupting their workflow.They can just wake up the next day to an updated machine.If you're already supporting the bootstrap token,this will just start working when you usethe InstallLater action in ScheduleOSUpdate.Once the MDM knows which update is applicable to devices,the ScheduleOSUpdate command is used to deploythe update to macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.Just note, an MDM command can be usedto install the update during the deferral window or after.There are several options when usingthe ScheduleOSUpdate command.One option that must be set is the install action,whose value significantly affectsthe behavior of the update.The InstallASAP install action is the primaryupdate mechanism for userless macOS devices.InstallASAP uses the bootstrap tokenfor authentication on Mac computers with Apple silicon.This action performs immediately,with an option for a user to cancel the update.Just note that InstallASAP command does not automaticallyclose applications that are actively in useunless the InstallForceResart option is used.DownloadOnly is useful for both users and userless devicesto download the update in the backgroundbefore the installation time.NotifyOnly is used to alert users that there isan action for installation.Neither command will start the install.InstallLater allows you to schedulean Install Tonight update.The device will choose a window of time,usually between 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.,based on machine learning, using conditions such aswhen the device is least used,for the install to occur.The device then schedules the update to occurin that window of time, given that you are plugged into power.Let's check out the notifications.With the InstallASAP command, or Default command,users can get a restart countdown notification.The user can choose to cancel the restartin the notification options.And in macOS Monterey, when you use InstallLater,the user will get this notification.Let's examine this more closely.This notification shows that the updatewill attempt to install that night.The user is reminded that the device must be connectedto power at the time it performs the update later.For iOS or iPadOS devices,Default is the primary update mechanism.DownloadOnly is useful for both userand userless devices to install the downloadin the background before the installation time.Here is what a user would be presented with.Non-passcode-protected devices install the versionimmediately after the command is sent from the MDM server.Passcode-protected devices requirea slightly different flow.Once the device receives the install command from MDM,we will schedule the installation alertto show on the next unlock.This gives the user the option to Install Now,or Install Tonight,or Remind Me Later.On iOS, this first install alert shown to the userallows you to choose Install Now, Later, or Details.Subsequent alerts shown will say that the updateis ready to install.For example, "iOS 15.0 is ready to install."And the provided options are Install Now or Later.Tapping Later in the previous screenwill show the passcode promptwith the Remind Me Later option at the bottom.The MDM server can also flag an update as required.This will let the user choose Remind Me Latera maximum of three times.After the third tap of Remind Me Later,the installation notification will be shownevery time the user hits the Home screen,and the Remind Me Later option is removed.Let's return to the timeline where we're now readyto install the update.For userless devices, you can usethe InstallForceRestart option with ScheduleOSUpdate.Those devices will do a hard restart to perform the update.And for user devices, once you send the install command,you relied on the user to perform the update.That is, until now.I'm excited to tell you about a new featurewe are introducing for macOS.After the admin update deferral period is over,you want to ensure that updates are installed quicklyafter you've made them available to users.You don't want the user to continue to cancelor defer the update.You need a way to enforce it.In macOS Monterey, you now gain more controlover the InstallLater policy to enforce the update.You can specify the number of times the deviceshould prompt to install before the update is enforced.This number is defined by the MaxUserDeferrals key.This MaxUserDeferrals key implies the existing key,InstallForceRestart, once the maximum numberof deferrals has been reached.When you enforce the number of maximum deferrals,the user will receive informative notificationsabout the remaining number of attempts leftbefore a forced update will occur.To change the maximum number of user deferrals,you simply need to issue a new InstallLater command.Here's what the user would be presented with.When you set the MaxUserDeferrals value,the notification shows the remaining number of attemptsbefore a forced install.The update is scheduled for tonight,but the user is given options.They can select Remind Me Tomorrow,which will defer the update again and decrementthe count of remaining number of attempts.They can install it now, or they can have itattempt to update later tonight.If the user does nothing, the updatewill attempt that night.When the number of maximum user deferrals is reached,the user is notified that this update will be forced.This means the machine will restart to perform the update,regardless if the user is still using the device.With these new changes, admins gain more controlover enforcing the macOS update and ensuring thatdevices are updated in a timely manner.There is one more thing I want to tell youabout managing software updates.New this year, iOS and iPadOS now offer users a choicebetween two software update versionswithin the Settings app.For example, you can update to the next major OSas soon as it's released, for the latest featuresand most complete set of security updates.Alternatively, continue on the current major releaseand still get important security updates,until you're ready to jump to the next major versionof iOS or iPadOS.A new option on the Settings command lets you controlwhat OS update is presented to the user.You specify this by providing a SoftwareUpdateSettingsdictionary, which has a key called RecommendationCadence.This key can have three values.Here's what's shown if you have RecommendationCadence set to 0.This is the default view, which is what you would getif no MDM restrictions are in place.Both the major and minor versionsof updates are available.Here's what's shown if you have RecommendationCadence set to 1.If two software update versions are available,the device will show the software update versionwith the lower version number.Here's what's shown if you have RecommendationCadence set to 2.If two software update versions are available,the device will show the software updatewith the higher version number.Just note, if a deferral is set with the existingenforceSoftwareDelayUpdate key,the device will take that into accountand filter by the RecommendationCadence.The two update choices will eventually converge.To recap, on macOS, we will now support deploying updatesusing an OS version so MDMs can determinewhat updates are needed for devicesand push them in a timely manner.We have also automated InstallLater flowson Mac computers with Apple siliconusing the bootstrap token.We will allow the MDM to enforce updates with MaxUserDeferrals,allowing for users to stay informed aboutwhen updates occur, and scheduling updatesat times least likely to disrupt their workflows.Finally, on iOS, we have added support to managewhat versions of updates are shown in Settings.We look forward to you gaining this additional controland providing a great update experiencefor users in macOS Monterey and iOS 15.Thank you, and have a great WWDC.[percussive music]
