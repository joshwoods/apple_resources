I’ve been deaf my whole life.My world experience, my lived experiencehas been deaf all the way.So my world is visual.There’s no audio in my life.The way that influences my work is that it forces meto look at how apps run and consider the experienceof running them without audio.I’m blind, and, day-to-day,I develop code just like anyone else would,using the same tools plus a screen reader.Each day I’m motivated by the power of technologyto improve people’s lives,and for people with disabilities,you can really close the gapbetween what someone is capable of doingand what their current environmentand situation allows them to do.When you’re developing and driving accessibilityinto products, attention to accessibilityhas more impact and reach than any of us can imagine.And with a billion people in the worldwith some form of disability, it’s not a niche audience.And you want them all to walk up to the appand use it the same way.You don’t want the blind version of Pro Toolsfor these other guys.You want to have one universally accessible versionof the tool that everyone can walk up and use.The biggest misconception that people haveabout making apps accessibleis thinking that it’s a lot of workand it’s really difficult, but it’s not.Yeah, I remember once there wasan app that was completely inaccessiblebecause there weren’t labelson any of the graphical buttons.And I got in touch with the developer,and I pointed them to some resourcesand explained why this was a problem.And with, you know, just a day’s work,he was able to add those labels,and the app became mostly accessible.It’s a long-term investment in good designfor usability and accessibility.Takes a lot of input from all over the companyand from external beta testers.It’s really important to have your teamsbe reflective of all the different typesof people in the world because if you havethat diversity on your team,you’re going to solve problems in better waysand create better products.One thing I’d like to emphasizeis that the tools themselves need to be accessible.I can give you an example.I received a bug report regarding a problemwith the VoiceOver feature on our app.It happened to be the first bug assigned to me on this job,and I wondered for a moment--how can I test this if I can’t hear it?So I checked the settings on the phoneand found that VoiceOver provides a caption bar.Tweets and replies, Button.Media, Button. Likes, Button.My point is that someone at Applerecognized this and made a decisionto add that caption bar, which allows meto do my work, and, in turn,improve the experience for more people.The Seeing AI project, in many ways,was born out of that personal need.It describes the world around youincluding reading text and identifying peopleand objects around you.Chair, laptop, table.Plant, cup, chair, chair, plant.Early on we realized that we needed to providemore audio guidance on how to point the camera,and so, one of our team members came up with the idea,when scanning a barcode, to use a kid’s gameof “hot or cold” so that the beepsget faster the closer you are.Processing.Smucker’s seedless blackberry jam.Back when I was taking cabsfrom wherever I was to return home,I’d use the Notes app to communicate to the driver,but the text was so tiny, and the drivershad a hard time reading it, and I thought,"I really need something that can enlarge the textand make it easy to read and speed up our communication."So I developed an app called Cardzilla.The thing that makes me excited is peopleusing our tools that have disabilitiesbut they’re using them with the same facilityand energy and proficiency as sighted people.So, let’s make some music!Okay, so here we have the interface.A really nice note we received is from a fatherwho took his son to the zoo, and they were having a nice day,but the father said it really became magicalwhen he could use Seeing AIto read the signs, and therefore he was listeningto information about the orangutans,and now he could tell his son about that,and they could share that experience together.Or from parents who used it to recognizetheir children’s handwritten homework.And I love this.It’s one of the most favorite partsof my job is hearing from users.We had a family gathering,and my grandmother was there.I had just finished developing the app at the timeand I showed it to her,and she was really excited about it.She said, "Finally, I can really talk to you."She could just hit the dictate button and speak,and we could have an interactive conversation.By making tools more accessible,developers are making the worlda more inclusive and loving place.[upbeat music]
