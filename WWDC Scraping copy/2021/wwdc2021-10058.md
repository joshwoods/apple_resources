Search this video…♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Philippe Hausler: Hi, my name is Philippe,and I am really excited to introduce youto a cool new feature in Swift, AsyncSequence.Today we'll go over what async sequences areand the fundamentals behind them.Then we'll talk about how you can use them in your codeand go over a few of the new AsyncSequence APIs.And finally,we'll explore how you can build your own async sequences.So let's dive right in.This is a really simple tool I wrote to illustratesome of the cool new stuff you can do with AsyncSequence.In this tool, we start off with a URL to an endpoint.It lists recent earthquakes.Now, normally downloading stuff is really an asynchronous taskthat can take some time.But in this case,we don't want to wait for all the things to download;instead, we want to show things as they are received.So I decided to shake things up a bitand use the new async/await featuresto get the lines responded from this endpoint.The data that we're fetchingis formatted as comma-separated text,so each line is a complete row of data.Since the async sequence of lines is emitting each lineas it's received,that means we can potentially have a really large downloadahead of us.But by emitting them as we get them,the snippet feels really responsive,and the most awesome part about it is that you can usethe same things that you're familiar with usingfrom regular sequences in this new async context.That means that you can use the new for-await-in syntaxto iterate, and functions like map, filter, and reduce;or -- like in this sample -- the dropFirst functionto manipulate those values.So how does this work?Well, a lot of things that I'm going to talk about todayhave their groundwork based in the async/await talk.But let's recap a few key points.Async functions let you write concurrent codewithout the need for callbacks, by using the await keyword.Calling an async function will suspend and then be resumedwhenever a value or error is produced.AsyncSequence, on the other hand,will suspend on each element and resumewhen the underlying iterator produces a value or throws.Basically, as the name implies,they're just like regular sequencesbut with a few key differences.Namely, each element is delivered asynchronously.But because they are an asynchronous delivery,that means that failure is definitely a possibility.Some async sequences throw,but if failure is not an option, others do not.Just like functions that throw,the compiler will help make sure that errors are handledwhen iterating or composing.Generally speaking,asynchronous sequences are a descriptionof how to produce values over time.So an async sequence may be zero or more valuesand then signify completionwith returning a nil from its iterator,just like sequences.When an error occurs, that's also a pointat which the async sequence is at a terminal state,and after an error happens, they'll return nilfor any subsequent calls to next on their iterator.So let's take a dive into how that definition worksby first starting off with regular iteration.Here we have a pretty familiar pattern.This is a for-in loop.In this case, it's iterating quakes from a sequenceand then calling a functionwhen the magnitude is above a certain value.The compiler has knowledgeof how this iteration should work,but what it does isn't magic.The compilation stepreally just does some straightforward transformations.Let's examine those transformationsso you can understand what the asynchronous form of this is.This is roughly what the compiler doeswhen building the previous code.It first starts off by creating an iterator variableand then uses a while loop to get every quakeproduced by the iterator when next is invoked.To use the new async/await functionality,there is one slight alteration that can be made.It's as simple as changing that next functionto be an asynchronous one.We can now have the iteration participate in Swift concurrencyby awaiting the next quake.Let's rewind back to uncover what this would have been likeif the loop was on an async sequence.As previously mentioned,we need to await each item out of the async sequence.This is reflected in the new for-await-in syntax.This all means that if you know how to use Sequence,you already have a good idea on how to use AsyncSequence.There are a few ways you can utilize async sequences.As we just covered,you can use the new for-await-in syntax;or if the async sequence throws,you can use the new for-try-await-in syntax.This lets you easily iteratethe values produced asynchronously --without having to muck about with closures --and use the syntax you are already familiar withto iterate through them.Even things like break and continue just work.Now you have now had a good introductionto the theory of async sequences.Let's explore that iteration just a bit further.Given a source that is an async sequence,you can await each valueby using the for-await-in syntax.This means that it will await each itemproduced by the iterator,and when it would hit a terminal,it completes the loop.When iterating async sequences,breaking is obviously a good way to terminate iteration earlyfrom inside the loop.This works just like regular sequences.Here we're breakingwhen the location data is not present for the quake.Or if we have some of value we want to skip,we can use continue.In this case, if the depth is greater than some value,we're skipping thoseand continuing on to await the next quake.This next iteration from the downloadworks just like before, but in this case,the source that we have can throw an error.Just like throwing functions,try is required to process each elementwhen the AsyncSequence being iterated can throw.And also just like throwing functions,the compiler will detect when you're missing a tryand offer you a Fix-it to correct the mistake.This means that when an async sequence can produce errors,you're always safe,because the language forces you to either throw that erroror catch it.This second iteration runs sequentiallyafter the iteration of the first loop.Running code sequentially isn't always what's desired.If it's useful to run the iterationconcurrent to other things going on,you can create a new async task that encapsulates the iteration.This can be useful when you know the async sequences you're usingmight run indefinitely.Now, even though that sequence could potentially be indefinite,it's considerably less common to occur.But in the world of asynchronous behavior,it is something much more commonand something that you need to consider when using them.Thankfully, the facilities for concurrency in Swiftmake this really easy and safe to do.This can be also really helpfulwhen you want to potentially cancel the iteration externally.Here we can run the two iterations concurrentlyand terminate the iteration later on.It's pretty easy with tasks to scope the workof an iteration that might be indefiniteto the lifetime of some container.Let's next take a tour of some of the AsyncSequence APIsthat are available as of macOS Monterey,iOS 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8.There are a lot of them,but I'll show you some of the highlights.Reading from files is often a prime use casefor asynchronous behavior.FileHandle now has a new bytes property that gives accessto an asynchronous sequence of bytes from that FileHandle.This can be used in conjunction with the new extensionon AsyncSequencethat converts asynchronous sequences of bytes into lines.But dealing with files is so commonthat we decided that URL should have accessorsfor both bytes and lines.This is that same APIthat I used in the initial example.It's a convenience property on URLto return an AsyncSequence of lines from the contents,either from a file or from the network.I'm certain this will make a numberof previously really complicated tasks easy and safe.Sometimes getting things from the networkrequires a bit more control over the responsesand authentication.So URLSession now has a bytes functionto fetch an async sequence of bytes given a URL or URLRequest.If you want to know more, you should definitely check outthe session "Use async/ await with URLSession"for some more details on this and a whole lot morenew asynchronous capabilities with URLSession.But files and networks are not the only thingthat makes sense for AsyncSequence.Notifications can be now awaited with the new notifications API.And iteration is not the only wayto interact with an AsyncSequence.In this example, we're awaiting the first notificationfor remote changes that has a store UUID that matches.Using methods like firstWhere,along with the notifications async sequence,allows for some really neat new design patternsthat can make code that was previously expressingcomplicated logicnow compact and easier to read.And if all of those weren't cool enough,there are a whole lot of new APIsfor asynchronously manipulating values from async sequences.These should be pretty familiar,because they're some of the same functionsthat are available on Sequence.We've already covered a few so far,like dropFirst and firstWhere,but there are a whole lot more than just those.Pretty much anything you can think of for using on Sequencenow has an asynchronous counterpartfor working with AsyncSequence.Now that was a lot to take in, and you might be thinking,"Hey, those new APIs are really cool,and that syntax is super neat,but how can I make my own async sequences?"Well, let's do exactly that!There are a few ways of implementing an async sequence,but I'm going to focus in on how to adapt your existing code.Particularly, there are a few design patternsthat work really well with AsyncSequence,and we have some fantastic facilitiesfor making what you already have interact with this new concept.Some of those design patterns are like closuresthat are called multiple times,but also some delegates can work nicely too.Pretty much anything that does not need a response backand is just informing of a new value that occurscan be a prime candidate for making an async sequence.These design patterns are really commonand you likely already have a few in your apps today.This is an example of a common handler pattern.It's a class that has a handler propertyand a start and stop method.It seems like a perfect candidate for AsyncSequence.Existing usage might be something like thiswhere a monitor is created,and a handler to get values is assigned,and then the monitor is startedso that quakes can be sent to the handler.Later on, the monitor might be stoppedto cancel the events being produced.We can use the same interface to adapt the usageto the new AsyncStream type.It takes only a small bit of code to use itand allows you to build an async sequence.When constructing an async stream,an element type and construction closure is specified.The closure has a continuationthat can yield values more than once, finish,or handle termination.So this means, in this case,the monitor can be created inside the construction closure.And then the handler can be assigned to yield quakesto the continuation.And then the onTermination can handle the cancellationand cleanup.And then we can start monitoring.The same monitor code that we had beforecan easily be encapsulatedwithin the async stream's construction.This reduces the need to replicate the same logicin every use site.And this is how the usage of this async stream would work.You can use the powerful transformation functions --like filter --and the new for-await-in syntax.This lets you focus on the intent of your codeinstead of needing to worry aboutreplicating the bookkeeping,since everything is wrapped up into one place.There's a lot of flexibility with AsyncStreamto create your own async sequences.This is really just one exampleand there are likely numerous others that you can adaptin your own code.AsyncStream is a great way to adapt your existing codeto become an async sequence.It handles all of the things you would expectfrom an async sequence, like safety, iteration,and cancellation;but they also handle buffering.AsyncStream is a solid wayof building your own async sequencesand a suitable return type from your own APIs,since the only source of elements being producedis from the construction.And if you need to represent errors being thrown?Well, we have a type for that!AsyncThrowingStream that is just like AsyncStreambut can handle errors.It offers the same flexibility and safety as AsyncStreambut can handle failures by throwing from its iteration.AsyncSequence is a really powerful toolthat is both safe and familiarfor dealing with more than one asynchronous value.If you know how to use Sequence,you already know how to use AsyncSequence.We've gone over what async sequences are,and how they're used,and introduced you to AsyncStream.We've dived into the theory and what defines them,and a few of the newly introduced async sequences,and finally, how to build your own.I eagerly await what you do with them next.♪
