What’s new in SF Symbols

Search this video…Hello. My name is Luke Larson,and I'm an Xcode engineer.Later, I'll be joined by my colleague, Youssef Elabd.Interface Builder provides a simple and intuitive wayto build app user interfaces visuallywithout writing any code, allowing developers to focuson what's important in making their app stand out.Today we're going to show you what's new in Interface Builderin Xcode 13 that makes it easier than ever to utilizethe latest platform features, including new system providedcontrol styles, to make your app stand out even more.In this video, we're going to cover improvementsto the Interface Builder canvas and authoring supportfor button styles, table content styles,hierarchical symbols, and accessibility.Let's start with canvas improvements.One of the first things you'll notice with Interface Builderin Xcode 13 is the completely redesigned canvas bottom bar.The controls to the left of the bar provide all the samefunctionality as before, but in a more compact form,reserving more space for the canvas.There's a popover to choose a devicewhich contains a variety of devices organized in groups.Clicking a different device group expands itand causes the previous group to collapse,making it easier to find the device you're looking for.There are also buttons to configure scene layout,orientation, appearance,and all-new accessibility optionsthat we'll show later in the video.Other improvements include refinementsto the canvas outline view.And to show them, let's jump into Interface Builder.I'm working on a Booking Scene in a hotel app,and I noticed that it isn't positionednext to the Promotions Scene in the outline view to the left.Which is what I expect, since the Booking Scenesegues to the Promotions Scene.It's now possible to move and rearrange one or moreselected scenes in the outline view using drag and drop.So I'll drag the Booking Scene down to be positionedjust above the Promotions Scene.Great. Now the two scenes are positioned next to each otherand are easier to navigate between.You can also copy entire scenesby holding the Option key while dragging.Another refinement to the outline viewis that outline groups like Constraints are now selectable,allowing for keyboard navigation and easy modificationor deletion of entire groups of objects.To show this, I'll select a constraint groupin the outline view.This is equivalent to selectingall the constraints in the group.I'll press the Right Arrow key to revealthe four edge constraints contained in the group.Now I can easily modify the constantsfor all group constraints in the inspectorOr delete the entire constraint groupby selecting it and pressing the Delete key.Next, let's continue to new button styles.Interface Builder in Xcode 13 supports authoring buttonswith new preset styles,including the familiar Plain style,and three new styles: Gray, Tinted, and Filled.These new styles make it easy to create beautifuland consistent looking buttons directly in Interface Builderthat automatically provide support for system featureslike dynamic type, multiline titles, and accessibility.Additionally, button styles support further customizationwith options like preset button sizes and corner styles.I'll go into more style customizationlater in the video.Check out the video "Meet the UIKit button system"for more information on button styles.Let's jump back into Interface Builder to showthese new styles in action.There's a Book Room button at the bottom of the scenethat could use some attention.I'll use pinch-to-zoom to get a closer look.I'd like this button to have a fill colorand rounded corners to draw more attention to it.In Xcode 13, it's now possible to create buttons like thisdirectly in Interface Builder using button styles.Let's focus on the inspector.There's a new Style property near the topof the Button inspector.When a non-default style is selected,a button will be opted into the new button system,automatically getting supportfor dynamic type, multiline titles, and accessibility.I'll go ahead and open the Style pop-up menu in the inspectorand select the Filled style for my Book Room button.The button now has a blue fill color and rounded cornersthat look just right.And all I had to do was make a single change.Button styles are greatfor quickly getting the look you want.After selecting a style, new properties appearin the Button inspector,enabling further style customization,including Subtitle, title alignment,and color options,image positioning, Corner Style,and more advanced background configuration options.As the name suggests, the Filled style uses the app tint to seta button's fill color,giving it a prominent look and making it appropriatefor important buttons in a user interface.And corner styles mean you don't have to worry aboutsetting a specific corner radius.The default corner style is called Dynamic,which provides a great-looking corner radiusthat automatically scales with dynamic type,maintaining the appearance of the button at any size.Alternatively, the Fixed corner style's radiusremains the same as button sizes change.For cases where more control is needed,both Dynamic and Fixed corner styleshave customizable corner radiuses.Additionally, a range of preset corner stylesare provided, including Small, Medium, Large,and Capsule, all supporting dynamic corner scaling.Buttons with styles also gain access toa new Button Size property in the Size inspectorcontaining preset button sizes,including Small, Medium, and Large.Let's go back to the hotel app to lookfor more opportunities to adopt button styles.The Check in and Check out buttons are looking a bit plain.To make them more visible, I'll use the Tinted button style,which has a transparent tint-colored backgroundand is great for buttons that are important but don't quiteneed the prominent look that the Filled style provides.I'll select the Check in and Check out buttonsin the outline view by holding the Command key.And choose Tinted from the Button Style menuin the inspector.This is exactly what I was looking for for these buttons.Moving on, the Promotions Scene in this app has a few buttonsthat would also be perfect for the new Tinted style.Let's segue on over and take a look.Using the canvas Minimap, I'll double clickon the Promotions Scene to jump directly to it.This scene displays a list of active hotel promotionsguests can choose from by tappingthe appropriate Get button.Each Get button overlays an image and will benefitfrom the extra contrast provided bythe transparent background of the Tinted style.I'll go ahead and select the three Get buttonsin the outline view by holding the Command key.and choose Tinted from the Style menu in the inspectorto change all the button styles at the same time.That looks great.Tinted button title and background colorsare based on the app's tint color and providethe appropriate level of contrast.I'd also like the Get buttons to toggle and changetheir appearance after being tapped to indicatewhich promotions have been selected.I'll configure them to be toggle buttonsto achieve this behavior, which are new in iOS 15.In the inspector under Menu,I'll toggle the "Selection as Primary Option" propertyto make the selected buttons toggle buttons.Before continuing, I'd like to add a new buttonto the Booking Scene to allow customers to request help.I'll go ahead and open the object library...which now has buttons preconfigured to usethe new style system, including buttons with the Plain styleand three new styles: Gray, Tinted, and Filled.The Gray style has a transparent gray backgroundwhich provides a bit more contrast,so I'll drag out a new Gray button to actas a "Get Help" button and position itin the navigation bar.I'll select the new button in the outline view...and use pinch-to-zoom to get a closer look.I'll set the button's Title and Subtitle...its Image to a question mark symbol...and to add a bit more space between the image and titles,I'll set the image Padding.One of the advantages of using Interface Builderis being able to try out changesand quickly check the result.I'm not sure which Corner Style to use here,so I'll try the Capsule style to see how it looks.That looks good, but it's not what I'm looking for.Instead, I'll choose the Large Corner Styleto get the desired look.That was easy. Everything needed to creategreat-looking buttons is now available directlyin the Button inspector.For cases where more advanced style customization is desired,setting a custom Background Configuration enablesmore fine-grained control by revealing additional properties,including Corner Radius, Stroke, and Background Image.One of the steps before booking a room should be selectingthe number of guests expected to stay in the room.I'd like this scene to have the optionto choose between 1 and 4 guests.iOS 15 now supports Pop Up Buttons,which are perfect for this feature.A pop-up button is a button that when clickeddisplays a menu with a list of items.A single item can then be selected from that menu,which becomes the new label of the pop-up button.I've already created a Guests label,so all I need to do now is add a Pop Up Button.I'll open the object library and drag one out.Pop Up Buttons also support button styles,so I'll choose the Tinted style to match the Check inand Check out buttons.Then, I'll create two more menu items using Option-dragto copy the existing menu items in the outline view.Finally, I'll configure the menu itemsto have values from 1 to 4.Note that when an app is running on a Macwith Mac Catalyst 15, buttons with stylesautomatically map to native macOS variants,making it easier to get your app looking great on the Mac.iOS pop-up buttons are also now supported on Mac Catalyst 15,as well as tooltips, which provide more informationwhen the mouse cursor hovers over a control.I'm planning to have a Mac Catalyst versionof this app, so I'll go ahead and set a Tool Tipfor the new Pop Up Button in the Control inspector.And we're done.Note that menu items must be connected to actionsto display at runtime.Now that I've adopted new button styles across the app,let's build and run.Here's the app running with the new Gray styledGet Help button, Tinted room optionsand Filled "Book Room" buttons.And finally the Tinted promotion buttons, and they look great.Next, I'll hand it off to Youssef,who will cover table content styles,hierarchical symbols, and accessibility.Youssef?Thanks, Luke.The next workflow we'll be visiting is stylingyour Table View Cells using Table View Cellcontentconfiguration styles.Most great hotels also have a great restaurant.This hotel is no different.Recently, I've been working on adding a few views to the appto let guests check out the restaurant's menu.Let's pick up where I left off.I'll two-finger doubletap on his Table View controllerto focus in on it.This static Table View shows a list of the amenitiesat the hotel, and I've recently addedanother Table View row for the restaurant.I want the title labels in the cells here to stand outabove the subtitle labels underneath them.One of the new Table View Cell content configuration stylescan give us the appearance that I want.Here are some of the cell layouts you getwith the new cell styles like grouped header,value cell, and grouped footer.These new styles work great with imagesand also get some functionality like dynamic type for free.So let's head back to Interface Builderand restyle the cells in this Table View.I'll select all of the cells in the document outline,and I'll click on the Styles drop down near the topof the Attributes inspector, showing meall of the new content configuration styles.I'll select Subtitle Cell.Since we're now using one of the new styles,we can change Image Padding right from the inspector.Let's do that here to put some breathing roombetween the cell's labels and their images.Our cells now have larger, clearer title labels.This is exactly what I wanted, and a good visual improvement,but I still think the cells could do with some more color.Next, let's go over how hierarchical symbolscan help us out here.New in iOS 15, symbols can have multiple layersthat I can specify the color for on a layer-by-layer basis.This rendering can add more color and depth to my symbols.There are two new render modes that take advantage of this.The first is Hierarchical, which lets you specify the colorfor the symbol's primary layerand derives the colors for the symbol's other layersas reduced alpha versions of the primary layer color.The other mode is Palette,which lets you independently set the colorsfor the symbol's layers.You can learn more about the new symbol rendering modesin the "What's new in SF Symbols" video.The symbols in our Table Vieware currently rendering in Monochrome mode.However, I want to emphasize the symbol's primary elements.The Hierarchical rendering mode is perfect for this.Here are our symbols rendered using this new mode.The varied opacities between the symbol's layersgive it the emphasis that I want,so let's go ahead and adopt this in Interface Builder.Again, with all of the cells selected,I'll click on the Render Mode drop down for cells' symbols.I'll select Hierarchical and choose Tint Colorto match my app's color scheme.Great. We've given this Amenities viewa fresh new look by using one of the newcontent configuration styles for our cellsand the Hierarchical rendering mode for our symbols.Now that we've updated our Amenities view,let's go over accessibility.Let's turn our attention to the menu item detail view,which shows us some more informationon one of the restaurant's menu items.The Description Label here is using the subhead text style,which means it supports dynamic type.This label is already pretty wide,and I suspect we might run intosome layout issues with some of the larger type settings.New in Interface Builder in Xcode 13,you can now preview how your iOS scenes reactto Accessibility settingsright in Interface Builder at design time.As Luke mentioned before, the canvas bottom barhas all-new accessibility options.Clicking the Accessibility button brings upa popover showing me the different settingsthat I can adjust in Interface Builder.Some settings can change text sizes,frame values, and colors in my scenes.Now I can enable and preview those settings in my canvasto make sure my views react as intended.All right, let's get back to our Description Labeland verify that it works well in larger type sizes.To do this, I'll open up the Accessibility popover,activate the settings,and move the Dynamic Type slider.Notice that the Description Labelis now out of the view's bounds.I can fix this by opening up the Constraint popoverand adding a trailing constraint to my label.I'll also need to change the label's number of lines propertyfrom the Attributes inspector and set it to 0.This makes the label wrap around to as many lines as needed.With those changes, my label is no longer clippedand grows to fit its text.Dragging the Dynamic Type slider again,notice that the Description Labelnow fits great across all type sizes.Being able to preview Accessibility settingsat design time is really powerfulbecause it allows you to iterate fasterand stay within Interface Builder when adjustingyour views for the iOS Accessibility settings.Now that we've made all of those changes,let's check out our app running in the simulator.The cells in our Amenities Table Vieware using one of the Table View Cellcontent configuration stylesthat gave us the new layout that we wanted.The cells have the symbols we configured to usethe Hierarchical rendering mode,making the symbol's primary elements more prominent.Clicking through to our menu item detail view,the Description Label fits in great here.To recap, we started off by touring the more compactdevice bar and improvements to the outline view.We took a look at how you can customize your app's buttonsusing the powerful new button style system.We went over how to adopt pop-up buttons for bothiOS and Mac Catalyst, as well as how to quickly giveyour Table View Cells a new layoutusing content configuration styles.Your symbols can also get a lot more colorand emphasis with the new rendering modes.Finally, we also went over how previewingAccessibility settings at design time makes it much easierto ensure that your app's views work as intendedfor the many iOS Accessibility settings available.We made all of these changes without writinga single line of code, letting you spend more timefocusing on what makes your app stand out.We invite you to use all the tools we talked about todayto refresh, stylize, and modernize your app.And be sure to sure to check outthe "Meet the UIKit button system"and "What's new in SF Symbols" videos.Thanks for watching, and have a great WWDC21.[percussive music]
