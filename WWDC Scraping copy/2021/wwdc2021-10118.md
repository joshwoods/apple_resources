Search this video…Hi, I'm Rusty.I'm an engineer on the CloudKit team,and I'm excited to introduce a new CloudKit developer tool,as well as a brand-new CloudKit schema language.In this session,I'll talk about why integration testingcan be challenging for an applicationthat integrates with the cloud.Then, I'll demonstrate cktool,our new command line developer tool for CloudKit.You'll find out how cktool can be usedinside of Xcode to automate test setup.You'll learn about CloudKit's new declarative schema language.And then, I'll wrap things up with next steps.Let's get started.When you write applications that depend on cloud services,there are explicit contractsbetween your applicationand the services you depend on.Integration tests can help you validatehow you interact with these services,but properly automating setupof these integration tests can be challengingfor a few reasons.First, it's not always easy to keep the serverup to date with the data modelyour app is using.As you iterate on your schemaduring development of your app,it's important that the schema on the serverexactly matches the schema your app is usingwhen your tests run.Also, it can be difficultto ensure that your tests are runningagainst a consistent set of sample data in the cloudeach time the tests run,particularly if your tests modify that dataas part of the test.The CloudKit team has just made all of this easier for you.With the new CloudKit schema language we've just introduced,you can declare your CloudKit schemain a file right alongside your application code,and then check it into version controlso that you can track changesalong with all other changes in your project,and always ensure that your app's data modelis consistent with your CloudKit schema.And with the new cktool command line developer tool,you can easily automatethe process of sending this schema declarationto the CloudKit server,while also creating a consistent set of sample dataon the server right before you run your tests.Let me jump right in and start using cktool.First, cktool is installed with Xcode 13.Once you install Xcode 13,you can start using cktool from the Terminal right away.cktool is invoked with xcrun.It offers several commands.For example,it can create records on the CloudKit server,query records that already exist on the server,import and export the new schema language files,manage authorization for the tool itself, and more.Before using cktool,there are a few things to understandabout authorization with CloudKit.Since cktool communicates directlywith the CloudKit server,it's necessary to first get the tool authorized.You can choose to only authorize cktoolto perform container-management functions like schema import,or you can additionally authorize the toolto access data in your container.CloudKit has introducedtwo new concepts for this purpose.The first is called a "management token,"which is used by cktoolto manage your CloudKit container.The management token is tied to a single developer accountand can be used across developer teamsif that developer is a member of multiple teams.A management token is intendedfor configuration use cases only,like schema import and export.This token doesn't provide any accessto data in the container.So, we've also introduced a user token,which can be used to authorize the tool to write datainto the user's private database of an app's containeror to the public database of an app's container.I can get a management tokenand also a user token from the CloudKit Console.For more information on the CloudKit Console,you can check out "Meet CloudKit Console,"another WWDC21 session.Now that I've obtained both a management tokenfor my developer account and also a user token,I can add them to the tool,which will store them securely in my macOS Keychain,and I'm ready to proceed.I can now start doing some interesting things.For example, I'll ask for a listof my Apple developer team memberships.And I get back a list of teamsthat I'm a member of. Great.Now let's say that I have a database schemadefined in my container,and I want to commit it to my source code repositoryprior to making changes.With cktool, that's easy to do.Using this export-schema command,I can pull down my development schemato a file called “schema.ckdb.”This file is formatted in the newCloudKit schema language I mentioned earlier,and we'll explore this file in detail in just a minute.With cktool, I can add data to my container, too.Here, if I have sample values expressed as JSON,like for this sample Book record here,I can use that JSON as input to the tool,just like this, to create a recordin my public database.Okay, so now that you have a basic senseof how the tool operates,I'll make a simple three-step scriptto delete all the data from the development environmentof my app's CloudKit container,then send my schema declaration to the server,and finally, load some test data.That way, I can run this scriptas part of a test pre-action in Xcodeand ensure that my CloudKit containeris always in a consistent state,with the exact schema my application is usingbefore each time that I run my tests.So, here in Xcode,I'll edit the scheme for my project's applicationand choose Pre-actions in the Test phase.Now, I can add a New Run Script Action.I'll provide build settings for my app target,so that the script has a path to the schema filein my project.Right here, I'll paste a cktool commandto reset my container,and then, one to import schemafrom the file in my application project,and finally, one to create an example recordin my container's public database.Note that since these commands are synchronous,they will execute one after another,and any failure will stop execution,just in case something doesn't go as expected.In that case, I can take care to resolveany pre-test issuesbefore actually running my tests.That's it.Now, when I run my Xcode tests,cktool will prepare my CloudKit containerright before they run.Perfect.So, what if I need to changethe data model for my application?Let's talk more about CloudKit schema language.In fact, let's examine that schema.ckdb filethat I downloaded earlier.Inside the fileis the new CloudKit schema language,which is a powerful way to describethe record types in my schema.It's easy to read and write,and to include right here in my projectwith my application code.Here inside the schema section,there are record types.These exactly mirror the record typesas shown for my container in the CloudKit Console.Each record type has multiple fields,and each field has a name and data type.The triple-underscore field names are system fields,which are created by CloudKit for every record type.Below these system fields are my custom fields,which represent my custom application datafor this record type in CloudKit.I can create an index for a field,like a Queryable, Searchable, or Sortable index,just like I can do in the CloudKit Console.I do this in CloudKit schema languageby declaring the indexright after the data type for the field,like for this "title" custom fieldin my Book record type here.Below the field definitionsare the security role settings for the record type.This is where permissions can be grantedto each named security role,like for each of these three built-insystem security roles here.“_creator" includes only the user that created the record,“_world" includes all users,and “_icloud" includes any authenticated user.Note that in CloudKit schema language,you can include both single and multi-line commentsto make the schema files even more readablefor you and your team.Comments will be ignored by the CloudKit serverwhen the file is processed,so feel free to put comments wherever you'd like.Now that CloudKit schema languageprovides developers a fast, flexible wayto declare and modify schemas,it's important to remember a few core conceptsaround CloudKit schema evolution.First, you have full control over record typesin the development environment of your container.You can add and remove record types in development,and also add and remove custom fieldsinside those record types, with no limitations.Of course, new record typescan always be promoted to production,and new fields can be added to existing record typesin production, as well.But once record types have been promotedto the production environment of your container,they can't be deleted or renamed,and custom fields inside record typesthat have been promoted to productioncannot be deleted or renamed, either.The reason for thisis to ensure that the CloudKit serveralways understands record types and fields,which older versions of your app might still be using.This means that while you canmake destructive changes to your schema declarationin the development environment of your container,you will not be able to promotethese destructive changes to production.Note that it is possible to add and removeindexes in production,and security role settings can be modified, too.All of these schema promotion conceptsare not new to CloudKit,but the flexibility you getfrom this new file-based schema declarationmeans that it's important to review and understand them.Now that you've gotten a sense of what cktool can doand how CloudKit schema language works,I encourage you to try out both in your own projects.Authorize cktool with a management tokenand user token from the CloudKit Console,and explore its commands.Export your existing CloudKit schemainto a CloudKit schema language file,and add it to your project,making sure to check it into version controlwith the rest of your project.Compose some setup steps for your integration testsusing cktool,and add the script as a test pre-actionto your Xcode scheme.The ability to administer certain elementsof your CloudKit container from the command linecan be really powerful.Maintaining a declaration of your CloudKit schemain a file, right alongside all of your other application code,can help you keep it consistent with your data modelthroughout your development life cycle,and tying all of this togetherto automate cloud setup of your integration testsis even better.We're excited to find outwhat you do with these new tools.Thanks for taking the time to learn more about CloudKit,and for your interest in WWDC21.[music]
