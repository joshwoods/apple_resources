Search this videoâ€¦Hi.My name is Mahesh Molakalapalli.I'm an engineering manager from the App Store team.In this session, I am excited to introduce youto the newly redesigned App Analyticsand highlight a number of updates.Our goal with App Analytics is to maximize your opportunityon the App Store by providing unique insights.We do this by sharing metrics about your appacross the entire App Store ecosystemwithout requiring you to add any code.Today, I will tell you four new ways that App Analyticsgives you the data you need to grow your business.I will talk about the new metrics that allow youto monitor transactions better than before.Then I will show you how you can measure macOS usage,including for iPhone and iPad apps on Mac.After that, I will talk about how you canuse data to analyze your App Clips performance.I will end with how you can enhance your presenceon the App Store with Custom Product Pages,In-App Events, and Product Page Optimization.Let's start with monitoring store transactions.Later this year, we will be addinga lot of new metrics to App Analytics,helping you better understand transactionsfrom pre-orders to total downloads.To help bring this data to life, I will be usingmy favorite test app, Mountain Climber.This app helps customers viewlivestreams of hikes at famous mountainsso that people can enjoy the outdoorswhile staying at home.Let's pretend you are the developer of Mountain Climber,and you are about to launch your appfor the very first time.Your app will be live-streaming a climb up Half Domeas your inaugural event, and you want to getas many people onto the app as you canin anticipation of the climb.In order to generate that excitement,you set up a pre-orderto drive people to your product page,as you want to make sureyour customers have the app on day one.Later this year, App Analytics will let youmonitor how your pre-order campaignis driving interest in your appwith a brand-new pre-order dashboard.This dedicated dashboard will let you see how manyImpressions, Product Page Views, and Pre-Orders you have.And you will be able to view your pre-ordersby device and by source type.You can also view by territory.This will help you to seewhere your pre-orders are coming fromand focus your marketing efforts on those areas.And on the Metrics tab, you will be able to seehow your pre-orders are rolling in over time.It is common to see a large spike in the beginningwhen the pre-order is first launched.This is a good indicationthat some of your future customersare very excited about your app.When your pre-order is completeand your app becomes ready for sale,the dashboard will open upand show all of the metrics for your app.Once Mountain Climber goes live,it's time to see how many purchases you are getting.You are selling access to the Half Dome stream.And in this case, it costs $0.99to have unlimited access to the climb.The proceeds from this transactionwill be available in App Analytics.To view your proceeds,click on the drop-down and select Proceeds.This will pull up the Proceeds chart so you can track itover time and see if your overall revenue is increasing.Now, let's say you have just released a new updateto Mountain Climber, which you call version 1.1.And you want to see how many customershave updated to this latest version.Later this year, you will be able to go intoApp Analytics and see your app updates over time.The total number of updates tell youhow many customers have your new app version,allowing them to take advantageof the new features you just rolled out.Next up, re-downloads.We know that customers might remove apps from their devicesfor different reasons, and it's important for youto understand when and how your app gets those customers back.So later this year, we're excited to introducere-downloads to App Analytics.You will be able to view re-downloads by territory,device, and more, so you can pinpointwhere your re-downloads are coming fromand adjust your re-engagement strategyto maximize your customer base.But it doesn't end there.We are going even furtherby providing total downloads as well.Total downloads represent first-time downloadsplus re-downloads and will give youthe most complete picture of how many customersare downloading your app from the store.Now that you know about all the ways you will be ableto monitor your store transactions,let's talk about how you can use macOS to reacheven more customers with your app.With the introduction of Mac with Apple Silicon,iPhone and iPad apps are now automaticallyavailable on the Mac with no additional code,which lets you reach more customers with your app.Now you can see how many customersare using your app on the Mac in App Analytics.By selecting the dimension drop-down at the topand clicking on Device, you can view data by deviceand see how many of your sessions are coming from MacOS,which falls under the Desktop category.Here we can see thatthere have been over 6 million sessions on Macin the last 30 days.Clicking on the metrics drop-down allows youto see a number of other new metrics for the Mac,including Installations, Active Devices,active in the last 30 days, Crashes, and Deletions.Let's take a look at crashes.Looking at the data, it looks like Mountain Climberhas very few crashes on the desktop.Considering how many sessions the app has,this is a good sign that the app is stableand working as expected on Mac.Now you know how to measure your macOS usageeven if your app wasn't originally built for the Mac.Next, let's talk about how you can analyze your App Clips.App Clips are a great way for customers to quicklyaccess and experience what your app has to offer.Whether your customers are ordering take-outfrom a restaurant, renting a scooter,or setting up a new connected appliance for the first time,they will be able to start and finish an experiencefrom your app in seconds, with App Clips.And now in App Analytics, you can learn all abouthow your customers are discoveringand using your app clip.Let's take a look.On the Overview page, we have a dedicated ribbonto help you get a high-level understanding ofhow your app clips are performingby viewing Installations, Sessions,and Crashes for your clip.If you click on View Details, you will be takento a more detailed Overview page for App Clips.Here, you can see how many Card Views your clip has.Cards are what pop up on the customer's phoneto confirm that they want to open a clip.We also show how many Sessions your clip has attractedas well as how many Crashes you have.Below that, we show you how many Installationsyour clip has and where those installations came from.The last part of the Overview page highlightsthe Top Territories where your app clip was found,which can be viewed by Card Views,Installations, and Sessions.As you can see, there are a ton of great waysto analyze your App Clips and see how your customers use them.Lastly, let's talk about how you can enhanceyour presence on the App Store.We have three new App Store features coming up in the fallthat we are very excited about -Product Page Optimization,Custom Product Pages, and In-App Events.Each of these features is designed to help youacquire more customers through the App Store.Let's talk about how you can use App Analyticsalongside each of these features.First, let's talk about Product Page Optimization.With this feature, you can set up and testdifferent variants of your default pageto determine which one best works withyour App Store visitors.As part of this,App Analytics will be releasing a brand-new dashboard.The new dashboard helps you determinewhich variant results in the best conversion rate.We will also perform statistical analysis on the resultsusing a Bayesian methodologyallowing you to monitor the test over time.And you will also be able to stop the test at any time.With this feature, you can be sure thatyou are using your best icons, screenshots, and preview videos.Next, let's talk about Custom Product Pages.With this feature, you will be able to customizethe content of your product pages and drive audienceto the page you think will be the most relevant.Then in App Analytics, you will be able to viewthe results of each product page across multiple metrics,including product page views, downloads,conversion rate, proceeds, retention, and more.You can learn about both Product Page Optimizationand Custom Product Pages in the session called"Get ready to optimize your App Store product page."One more existing feature that we announcedis In-App Events.This lets you promote app experienceshappening within your appson a particular date and time, such as a game competition,a live-streaming experience, and more.In App Analytics, you will be able to see how your eventis performing on the store, including how many impressionsyour event had on the store,how many people asked to be notified when the event begins,how many customers downloaded the app from your event page,and how many app openscame from the event page on the store.All of this will help you understandwhich events are catching your customers' attentionand making them excited about your app.You can learn more about In-App Events by viewingthe session "Meet In-App Events on the App Store."With that, I want to thank you for watching this presentation.To recap,
