Search this video…♪ ♪Hi. I'm Kate.I'm an engineer on the Safari and WebKit team,and today I'm gonna be telling youabout Privacy-Preserving Ad Attribution.I know a lot of you watching today's sessionare probably already experts on the history of ad attribution,but to make sure everyone's on the same page,I'll start with some backgroundon cookies, advertising, and tracking.Then, I'll introduce Private Click Measurement,a tool that allows you to privately measuread campaigns across websites.Then I'll show you how you can expand PCM even more,to measure ad campaigns that start in appsand convert on the web.Finally, I'll talk about improvementsin privacy-preserving app-to-App Store ad attributionusing SKAdNetwork.So, let's start with the history of cookiesand their role in web advertising.Cookies are useful to businesses because they provide supportfor something called ad attribution.Ad attribution is the process of linking an ad-related action,like a click,with a desired outcome, like a purchase.You'll also hear me refer to those desired outcomesas "conversions."This concept may seem a little abstract in words,so let's walk through an example.I happen to really like longboarding.Say I tap an ad for a longboard on my favorite search site,searchforlongboard.biz.searchforlongboard.biz can store something called a cookiein the browser.Cookies are useful little bits of textthat help sites remember data about your previous visits,like products in your shopping cart.The link on searchforlongboard.bizmight navigate me to a new site,longboardshop.biz,where I add the longboard to my cart.searchforlongboard.biz can reference the cookiethat it stored earlierto link my purchase with the initial ad tap I made.This is an example of ad attribution.The cookie data allows searchforlongboard.bizto measure the effectiveness of this particular ad campaign,which is really useful for its business.But what if I hadn't made an initial ad tap earlier?searchforlongboard.biz would still getthe cookie data about me,which can include clicks I've made,sites I've visited, time I've spent on a page,and other detailed informationabout my web history and behavior.Companies like searchforlongboard.bizcan use this informationto follow users across sites and build detailed profilesfor advertisers, all without a user's consent.We call this cross-site tracking.Most users don't expect to have an invasive experienceon the web, where their interests, behavior,and personal information is stored and tracked.Tracking can break trustand create a misalignment between users and businesses.And now, more and more users have started turningto mechanisms, like ad and content blockersto limit tracking on the sites they use.From a user perspective, content blockers are greatfor preventing tracking,but can often lead to compatibility issues.Additionally, since content blockers block all ads,there's clearly no possibility for any sort of ad attribution.The disconnect between users and businessesaround ads and trackingis hugely damaging to the web experience,and we wanted to find ways to protect user privacywhile maintaining web compatibility.So, in 2017, Apple built Intelligent Tracking Prevention,or ITP,which identifies trackers and protects usersagainst this sort of profiling on the web,without blocking ads.With ITP, I might tap the same adon searchforlongboard.biz,which stores a first-party cookieand navigates me to longboardshop.biz,where I add the longboard to my cart again.But now, ITP prevents cookies and other website datafrom being sent to third parties,like searchforlongboard.biz.So, they may know that I tapped an ad for longboards,but they won't be able to track my behavior on any other sites.ITP specifically mitigatescross-site tracking in the browser,but tracking is not unique to the web.The Identifier For Advertisers, or IDFA, has long been usedto perform similar profiling of iOS users across apps.In 2020, Apple launched SKAdNetwork,a part of the StoreKit framework.It collects and reports data about adsthat lead to app installs,and it was designed to give Ad Networksprivacy-preserving techniques for ad attribution.I'll talk later on about improvementsto SKAdNetwork over the last year.Tracking infringes on a user's privacywithout giving them the ability to identify, understand,or consent to what's being shared about them.And we aren't the only ones thinking about this.Regulations like CCPA and GDPRare requiring websites to inform their usersabout how their data is being used.Other browsers like Brave and Firefox are also shippingwith built-in tracking protections.It's becoming clear that business modelsthat rely on tracking aren't sustainable.We recognize the importanceof providing a more private way to measure adsto help you thrive in this changing ecosystem.So the rest of our session will focuson some of the exciting new solutions we've implementedto help you measure ads with privacy.The first case I'm gonna cover is web-to-web ad attribution,meaning both the initial click or tapand the final conversion event both occur in the browser.This year, we're so excited to introducePrivate Click Measurement, or PCM,which brings privacy-preserving ad attribution to the web.PCM is a proposed standardin the W3C Privacy Community Group.To be on track to become a full standard,it needs an implementation from another browser.We're working with other browsersto standardize PCM across the web.PCM is an entirely on-devicead-attribution reporting mechanism.Limited entropy in the reports prevents a sitefrom being able to identify a specific user.And when using PCM,the user isn't being tracked across sites.This means App Tracking Transparency requirementsdon't apply for uses of PCM.Currently, PCM web-to-web and app-to-webare fully supported in Safari.So, throughout the rest of this presentation,whenever I refer to "the browser,"I mean Safari.We are working towards adding supportfor other browsers as well,both those that use the WebKit engineand those that don't.Let's go back to our original longboard exampleto show how PCM works.Again, I tap an ad for a longboardon searchforlongboard.biz.With PCM, this link specifiestwo additional pieces of information:a Source ID, which is 8 bits of entropythat you can use to specify the ad campaign,and the site that the ad will convert on,called the attribution destination site.These are stored on-device in the browser.The ad link then navigates me to longboardshop.biz.When I tap Add to Cart,longboardshop.biz can specify informationabout the conversion event using an additional valuecalled the trigger data.The trigger data is 4 bits, and it might specifyan action like an Add to Cart or a purchase.This is stored on-device, in the browser, as well.So, what about reporting?Note that only the browser has both the click-sideand the conversion-side information.So, if the conversion matches a stored click,the browser can format this informationinto a report that's useful to the advertiser,while preventing any identificationof a user across sites.The browser then schedules the reportto be sent to both the sourceand the destination sites, randomly 24 to 48 hours later.The random delay prevents the reportsfrom providing any time-related datathat might link ad-clicks and conversions togetherto identify someone.As of iOS 15 and macOS 12,these reports also have IP address protection,which is crucial to prevent fingerprinting.You can find out more about IP address protectionin Apple's privacy pillars in focus WWDC session.OK, so how do you actually specify PCM datawhen running an ad campaign?On the source site, where the ad is being displayed,you can specify PCM data using link attributes.Here we see the Lemon Yellow Longboard campaignhas an identifier 55,and converts on longboardshop.biz.On the destination site,you can trigger an attribution eventby making an HTTP GET request to the source site,potentially specifying data about the conversion event.The source site gets this request,then needs to redirect it to this well-known location.Adding the longboard to my cart has a trigger data value of 15.And if you later on wanted to override this conversionwith a more important one, like a purchase,you might specify a higher 6-bit priority.This design was intended to support legacy pixelsto make adoption easy.The last step is reporting.The report will be sent in a JSON formatto this well-known location.The report provides the datathat links an ad click with a conversion,but you can see that there's no identifying informationabout the user included.In this case, what you learn is that someone, somewhereadded a lemon yellow longboard to their carton longboardshop.biz.You can use this information to measure ad campaignswithout needing to track specific users.And those are the basicsfor implementing Private Click Measurementto measure web-to-web ad campaigns.Now, I'll show you how you can expand PCM even more,to use in your apps.We've heard lots of feedbackabout the importance of measuring ad tapsthat start in apps and convert on the web.We realized how crucial it is that we bridge this gap,so we're excited to also be introducingPCM app-to-web attribution.Let's go through an example of how this works.Now, I open Social App, which is what I use to catch upwith all of my longboarding friends.And I tap an ad for a longboard.The Source ID and destination siteare stored on-device.Then, I'm navigated to longboardshop.biz in Safari.The conversion side is exactly the same as the web-to-web case.When I tap Add to Cart, longboardshop.biz can triggera conversion with the trigger data,which is stored in the browser.The browser combines the information into a report,then sends it to both the app reporting siteand the destination site on a random 24 to 48 hour delay.To use PCM app-to-web attribution,you should add an attribution reportdestination site to the app's info.plist,with the key NSAdvertising- AttributionReportEndpoint.This step is crucial,because we take the registrable domainfrom the report destination URLto form a well-known path for sending reports.This well-known path is exactly the same as the web-to-web case.For PCM app-to-web, you'll also need to make some changesin your app's code.We know that, in order to measure campaigns effectively,it's important to know that an ad tap has actually occurred.So, we've added a new data structurecalled a UIEventAttributionView.When you display an ad in your app,you'll create a new UIEventAttributionView.Then, you'll place it over your ad.The UIEventAttributionView verifiesthat a user gesture has happened before reporting an attribution,so that you know that the reported data is accurate.When the user taps the ad, you then need to createa new data structure called a UIEventAttribution,which is submitted when an app opens a URLto an external website.This gets populated with four things:the source identifier,which identifies the ad campaign,in this case, for a lemon yellow longboard;the destinationURL, where the ad will be converted;the sourceDescription,a description of the content that was tapped;and the purchaser,a description of the buyer of the content.If you're using a UIScene-based life cycle management,you'll create a OpenExternalURLOptions object.Then, you should assign your event attribution objectto the corresponding property and call the open function.If you're using UIApplication-basedlife cycle management,adding support for app-to-web campaignsis a bit different.You'll need to create a dictionarythat contains the eventAttribution object.Then you can call the open functionwith the dictionary as the value for the options parameter.And that's pretty much itfor implementing app-to-web attribution.Before we move on to SKAdNetwork improvements,I want to touch briefly on PCM fraud prevention.Since PCM reports carry no identifying information,there's no inherent way for the server to knowif a conversion report is trustworthy.So, PCM uses cryptographic signaturesto prevent fraud.To explain signatures,I'm going to use a popular envelope analogy.It works like this.When the ad tap occurs on searchforlongboard.biz,the browser fetches searchforlongboard's public key.It then creates a messagethat searchforlongboard will validate later on.However, since we don't want searchforlongboard.bizto be able to link a click and conversion together,we'll hide this message.Think of it like putting the message in an envelope.The browser will then send the hidden messageto searchforlongboard.biz.They sign the hidden messageusing an RSA blind signature schemeand send it back.You can think of this like carbon copy paper.The signature on the envelope will also apply to the message.So, when the browser removes the message from the envelope,it will have searchforlongboard'ssignature on it.When the attribution occurs,the browser sends the attribution reportwith searchforlongboard's signature.Now, the sourceand destination site can validatethat the click was deemed trustworthy when it happened,using searchforlongboard's public key.Since searchforlongboard.biz never saw the original message,it can't link it with the ad click.So, that's it on fraud prevention.And I also want to talk about testingbecause we know that it's importantfor you all to be able to have a simple, fast, and easy wayto test and debug.WebKit has an experimental featurecalled Private Click Measurement Debug Mode.You'll find it in the Safari Develop menu for macOS,under Experimental Features.On iOS, you can turn on Debug Modein the WebKit Experimental Features menu.Debug Mode has enhanced Web Inspector logging,and reports will go out every 10 seconds,as opposed to 24 to 48 hours later.That's it for using PCMto support your web-to-web and app-to-web campaigns.I now want to pivot to talk about how you can improveyour app-to-App Store ad campaigns,with recent updates to SKAdNetwork.First, let's start with a brief overviewof SKAdNetwork up to this point.Note that the basics of SKAdNetwork were coveredat WWDC in 2020,so it would be useful to reference those presentationsfor a more detailed overview of how it works.Essentially, SKAdNetwork involves three parties:ad networks, publisher apps, and advertised apps.Let's say I'm using Social App, and I'm served an adfor Longboard App by SocialAdNet.In SKAdNetwork terms, SocialAdNet is the AdNetwork,Social App is the publisher app,and Longboard App is the advertised app.If I tap the ad for Longboard App,this generates a reportwith the Ad network ID, Publisher app ID, Campaign ID,timestamp, and additional informationfor fraud prevention.This information is stored on-device, in the App Store.Let's say the ad for Longboard Apptakes me to the App Store,where I install and launch Longboard App.Now Longboard App calls one of two APIs offered by StoreKit:RegisterApp- ForAdNetworkAttributionor updateConversionValue.Both will trigger the SKAdNetwork reporting,and you can check out the documentationfor more information on when to use which call.StoreKit will combine the useful information into a reportand send it to the ad network.Now that we have some background on SKAdNetwork,I'll talk about some improvements we've madeover the last year.Since we launched SKAdNetwork,we've been listening to your feedbackand making changes.Each version introduced somethingto help you better meet your needswith ad attribution, whether that be more security,more ways to measure ads, or more attribution reporting.In this section, we'll talk about Signing Key improvements,support for View-Through Attribution,Multiple Postback and IP address Protection,and Postback to Developer.Also, note the minimum iOS versionneeded to utilize each new feature.First, in version 2.1, Apple introduced a strongerand more secure 256-bit public key.You should update the Apple public key you're usingto validate postbacks in order to utilize this.Detailed steps on how to verify Apple's signaturecan be found in the linkto SKAdNetwork's documentation associated with this session.Next, Version 2.2 added support for view-through ad campaigns.This involves creating a new SKAdImpression instance,generating a signature, and calling two new APIs:startImpression,when you start to present your custom ad to the user,and endImpression,when you finish presenting the ad.With view-through attribution, StoreKit also introduceda new parameter called Fidelity type.StoreKit-rendered click-through adshave a fidelity type of 1,while custom view-through ads have a fidelity type of 0.This gives view-through impressionsa lower priority than click-through ones,and a view-through postback will only be reportedif there's no competing impressionwith a higher fidelity.iOS 14.6 introduced multiple postbackand IP address protection.Now, SKAdNetwork supportssending reports to a winner networkand up to five runner-ups.The winning network is determinedby the last impression that occurred before the conversion.When a report is generated,the winner has the possibility to receivethe crowd anonymity controlled values,like the sourceApp and conversion value.Runner-ups will not get this information.Also new in SKAdNetwork is the postback to developer,where the winning postback gets reportedto the advertised app.In order to utilize the postback-to-developer feature,your app will have to specify the developer reporting sitein your Info.plist.This uses the sameNSAdvertising- AttributionReportEndpoint keynecessary for PCM app-to-web reporting.Just like with PCM, the registrable domainfrom the URL specified in the plistwill be used to form the well-known locationwhere the postbacks will be sent.Now, I'll give some best practicesfor successfully testingand debugging new SKAdNetwork technologies.First, a reminder that the nonce for each impressionshould be unique.This is important for fraud preventionand maintaining the integrity of your reports.Next, the order of the arguments matterswhen creating the signature.So, if you're encountering issues at this step,you can check out the documentationto make sure your argument order is correct.Next, for testing postbacks, you should always usea development-signed source app with a source app ID of 0.And lastly, a reminder that a testing profilewill speed up postback transmission timeand is available to downloadfrom the link associated with this session.So, that's it for SKAdNetwork improvements,and that concludes all of this year's updatesfor privacy-preserving ad attribution.As you can see, there's a lot of featureswe've implemented and improved over the last yearto help you adopt private ad attribution.So let's review what I covered today.First, I introduced PCM, an ad-attribution mechanismthat brings private ad measuring to the web.PCM supports not only ad campaignsmeasured entirely on the web,but also campaigns that start in apps and convert on the web.I also went over all the updates that have gone into SKAdNetworkover the last year,that give you an even more private,secure, and useful way to measure app installs.And lastly, I want to reiteratethat so much of the design and improvementsof these technologies has comefrom hearing from you all as developers.So, thanks. And we askthat you keep providing feedback.We welcome any thoughts on the PCM proposed standard,which can be found on the W3CPrivacy Community Group GitHub page.If you came into this with the ideathat privacy and advertising don't mix,I hope this session helped you see a futurewhere they actually align.Thanks for watching, and I hope you enjoy the rest of WWDC.[upbeat music]

This year, we're so excited to introducePrivate Click Measurement, or PCM,which brings privacy-preserving ad attribution to the web.

OK, so how do you actually specify PCM datawhen running an ad campaign?On the source site, where the ad is being displayed,you can specify PCM data using link attributes.Here we see the Lemon Yellow Longboard campaignhas an identifier 55,and converts on longboardshop.biz.

On iOS, you can turn on Debug Modein the WebKit Experimental Features menu.

Debug Mode has enhanced Web Inspector logging,and reports will go out every 10 seconds,as opposed to 24 to 48 hours later.

That's it for using PCMto support your web-to-web and app-to-web campaigns.

I now want to pivot to talk about how you can improveyour app-to-App Store ad campaigns,with recent updates to SKAdNetwork.First, let's start with a brief overviewof SKAdNetwork up to this point.Note that the basics of SKAdNetwork were coveredat WWDC in 2020,so it would be useful to reference those presentationsfor a more detailed overview of how it works.Essentially, SKAdNetwork involves three parties:ad networks, publisher apps, and advertised apps.Let's say I'm using Social App, and I'm served an adfor Longboard App by SocialAdNet.In SKAdNetwork terms, SocialAdNet is the AdNetwork,Social App is the publisher app,and Longboard App is the advertised app.If I tap the ad for Longboard App,this generates a reportwith the Ad network ID, Publisher app ID, Campaign ID,timestamp, and additional informationfor fraud prevention.This information is stored on-device, in the App Store.Let's say the ad for Longboard Apptakes me to the App Store,where I install and launch Longboard App.Now Longboard App calls one of two APIs offered by StoreKit:RegisterApp- ForAdNetworkAttributionor updateConversionValue.Both will trigger the SKAdNetwork reporting,and you can check out the documentationfor more information on when to use which call.StoreKit will combine the useful information into a reportand send it to the ad network.Now that we have some background on SKAdNetwork,I'll talk about some improvements we've madeover the last year.Since we launched SKAdNetwork,we've been listening to your feedbackand making changes.Each version introduced somethingto help you better meet your needswith ad attribution, whether that be more security,more ways to measure ads, or more attribution reporting.In this section, we'll talk about Signing Key improvements,support for View-Through Attribution,Multiple Postback and IP address Protection,and Postback to Developer.Also, note the minimum iOS versionneeded to utilize each new feature.First, in version 2.1, Apple introduced a strongerand more secure 256-bit public key.You should update the Apple public key you're usingto validate postbacks in order to utilize this.

Detailed steps on how to verify Apple's signaturecan be found in the linkto SKAdNetwork's documentation associated with this session.

Next, Version 2.2 added support for view-through ad campaigns.This involves creating a new SKAdImpression instance,generating a signature, and calling two new APIs:startImpression,when you start to present your custom ad to the user,and endImpression,when you finish presenting the ad.With view-through attribution, StoreKit also introduceda new parameter called Fidelity type.StoreKit-rendered click-through adshave a fidelity type of 1,while custom view-through ads have a fidelity type of 0.This gives view-through impressionsa lower priority than click-through ones,and a view-through postback will only be reportedif there's no competing impressionwith a higher fidelity.iOS 14.6 introduced multiple postbackand IP address protection.Now, SKAdNetwork supportssending reports to a winner networkand up to five runner-ups.The winning network is determinedby the last impression that occurred before the conversion.

When a report is generated,the winner has the possibility to receivethe crowd anonymity controlled values,like the sourceApp and conversion value.Runner-ups will not get this information.Also new in SKAdNetwork is the postback to developer,where the winning postback gets reportedto the advertised app.

In order to utilize the postback-to-developer feature,your app will have to specify the developer reporting sitein your Info.plist.This uses the sameNSAdvertising- AttributionReportEndpoint keynecessary for PCM app-to-web reporting.

Just like with PCM, the registrable domainfrom the URL specified in the plistwill be used to form the well-known locationwhere the postbacks will be sent.

Now, I'll give some best practicesfor successfully testingand debugging new SKAdNetwork technologies.First, a reminder that the nonce for each impressionshould be unique.This is important for fraud preventionand maintaining the integrity of your reports.Next, the order of the arguments matterswhen creating the signature.So, if you're encountering issues at this step,you can check out the documentationto make sure your argument order is correct.Next, for testing postbacks, you should always usea development-signed source app with a source app ID of 0.And lastly, a reminder that a testing profilewill speed up postback transmission timeand is available to downloadfrom the link associated with this session.So, that's it for SKAdNetwork improvements,and that concludes all of this year's updatesfor privacy-preserving ad attribution.

As you can see, there's a lot of featureswe've implemented and improved over the last yearto help you adopt private ad attribution.So let's review what I covered today.

First, I introduced PCM, an ad-attribution mechanismthat brings private ad measuring to the web.PCM supports not only ad campaignsmeasured entirely on the web,but also campaigns that start in apps and convert on the web.

I also went over all the updates that have gone into SKAdNetworkover the last year,that give you an even more private,secure, and useful way to measure app installs.

And lastly, I want to reiteratethat so much of the design and improvementsof these technologies has comefrom hearing from you all as developers.So, thanks. And we askthat you keep providing feedback.We welcome any thoughts on the PCM proposed standard,which can be found on the W3CPrivacy Community Group GitHub page.

If you came into this with the ideathat privacy and advertising don't mix,I hope this session helped you see a futurewhere they actually align.Thanks for watching, and I hope you enjoy the rest of WWDC.[upbeat music]
