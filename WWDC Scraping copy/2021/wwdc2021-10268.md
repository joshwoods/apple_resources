Search this video…Hello, and welcome to this sessionon Xcode Cloud workflows.My name is Justin, and I'm an engineerwith the TestFlight team, and along with my colleagues,Wesley and Kevin, we're here to introducethe ins and outs of creating your workflows in Xcode Cloud.Workflows are at the heart of Xcode Cloudand drive the continuous integrationthat enables you and your teamto automate building, analyzing, testing, archiving,and distributing your apps and frameworks.They are flexible and extensible,so you can customize workflows around your team'sexisting development and distribution processes.And with Xcode Cloud,workflow management is integratedinto the Apple developer tools you already use:Xcode and App Store Connect.In this session, let's break workflowsdown into their specific components.First, we'll walk through how to configure the conditionsthat automatically run your workflow.Then, we'll talk about the optionsfor setting up your environment.We'll also show you how to create multiple actionsfor the tasks you want to automate,along with actions to run afterward,like sending notifications about your builds,or automatically deploying those builds to TestFlight.Finally, we have some strategies for differentworkflows you may find useful and super convenientto boost your team's collaboration and productivity.We have a lot to cover, so let's get started.Let me hand it off to Wesley.Thanks, Justin!I'm collaborating on an app called Frutawith members of my developer team.It is already up and running on Xcode Cloud.If you haven't yet seen the session"Meet Xcode Cloud," be sure to check it out to learnabout setting up your first workflow.Right here, integrated in Xcode's Report Navigator,is a new Cloud tab,where I see the workflows and builds from my team.When I onboarded the Fruta app, it created a default workflowfor me that builds the main branch.This workflow has been working great for us,but because we're a team that also uses pull requests,I'd like to create a pull-request-specific workflowthat my team can leverage.I'd like it to run every time a pull request is createdby anyone on my team,analyze, test, and archive my app,notify my team when a pull-request build finishes,and deliver a version of my app to members of my teamso they can test out the features before they're mergedinto our main integration branch.Creating a workflow is easy to do.Under the Product menu, I can go to Manage Workflows,click Plus, and select my app.This will bring track a new workflow editor.A workflow is made up of several configurable components.Here's the general section, where I can name my workflow.I'm gonna name this "Pull Requests."If I were on a team where only a small numberof individuals are responsible for makingchanges to our workflows,I can choose to restrict editing to prevent unintended updatesthat might impact our team.By default,Xcode Cloud sets the primary repositoryand project information with the knowledgeof my local settings,but if I ever decide to move my primary repositoryor migrate from an Xcode project to a workspace,I can change those settings here.Next, let's take a look at the Start Condition section.This is where I can define when I want my workflow to run.Xcode Cloud has a number of condition types.For this workflow, I want to set its start conditionto run for all pull requeststhat intend to merge into the main branch.To do that, I can select from the Type menuand choose Every Change to a Pull Request.This condition type allows me to specify the sourceand target branch.I'll set the source branch to Any Branchand the target branch to Main.Now every time a team member creates a pull requestagainst Main and makes changes to it,Xcode Cloud will automatically run this workflow.When building pull requests, Xcode Cloud will now buildand test the merge of the source and target branch together,so my team members can be confidentand know the real impact of their changeswith the rest of the team.I can also narrow those conditionsto specific files or foldersand choose to set whether or not I want to auto-cancelany previously running builds when the workflow runs.This is useful if I push one commiton top of another in quick succession.Every Change to a Pull Request is just oneof the start conditions that you can set for a workflow,and depending on the needs of your team,we have other condition typesthat you can configure to meet those needs.Every Change to a Branch will always buildthe source branchand will ignore any pull-request states.Every Change to a Tag will build whenevernew tags are created.On a Schedule will build a branchof your choosing on a recurring schedule that you can choose.This is great if you have long-running teststhat you want to run on occasion.Now that I have configured the start condition,which dictates when this workflow will run,let's configure the Environment section,which dictates how the workflow will run.Xcode Cloud runs on Apple's Cloud Infrastructureand makes available various macOS and Xcode versions.To choose your Xcode and macOS version,you just need to select it from a menu.You can also set your workflow to point to the Latest Releaseor Beta version, so you could always buildor test on the latest software.As developers, we all care deeplyabout our productivity, and a large part of thatis the performance of the tools we use.Many of you will be working on large projectswith many files and deal with potentially long build times.Just as locally within Xcode,you have the option to build your changes incrementallyby just building the files that have changed.You also have this option in Xcode Cloud.This typically leads to faster builds.However, there are times when you mightwanna perform a clean build instead.This is important to make sure everything is functioningin your final build, and is also required to producebuilds that could be deployed to External Beta Testerswith TestFlight or to submit to the App Store.In the environment section,I have the option to select Clean.Since this is a pull-request workflow,I'll leave it unchecked so I can take advantageof the performance benefits.Every team works in its own unique way,and teams need their tools to have the flexibilityto be able to work the way they want to work.Xcode Cloud provides options to do what we believeare the most common development tasks out of the box.However, it also provides a rangeof options for extensibility.This extensibility allows you to connect Xcode Cloudwith the other tools and systemsyour teams use to get your work done.Xcode Cloud offers a comprehensive APIto access your data, configure workflows, and kick off builds.In addition to the existing scripting optionsthat Xcode provides,Xcode adds the ability to create custom scriptsthat run on the deviceswhich are performing your builds and tests.In the Environment section,I can specify environment variablesthat Xcode Cloud makes available to custom scripts.This is useful for configuration and secretsthat I don't want to check into the source code repository.I also have the ability to mark an environment variableas secret to provide an extra level of protection.You can find further information on thisin the "Customize your Advanced Xcode Cloud Workflows" sessionor in our documentation.So far, we've shown you howto configure when your workflows run and when they run.What environment should they run in?Next, let's talk about actions.Actions define the work that you want the workflow to dofor you and your team every time the workflow runs.The key actions you could ask Xcode to perform locallyare now all available to you within Xcode Cloud:building,running static analysis,testing,and archiving.The actions I want to set up are the Archive,Test, and Analyze actions.Let's start by adding the Archive actionby clicking the plus icon by Actionsand selecting Archive.I need to select the platform and the schemeI want to create an archive for.It already pre-selected the iOS platformand the iOS scheme, which is exactly what I wanted.I also have the option to registerfor TestFlight or make it ready for App Store distribution,but more on this later.You may notice that I didn't have to manageprovisioning profiles or code-signing identities.Xcode Cloud handles this automatically for you.To learn more about this,check out the session"Distribute Apps in Xcode with Cloud Signing."Now that the Archive action is set up,let's focus our attention on the Test action.Testing your apps is an incrediblyimportant part of the development process.Not only does it help ensure your users experiencefewer bugs, but it can speed up your development processby giving you confidence in the changes you are making.However, sometimes it can be cumbersome and slowto run your tests locally,and sometimes, you might just forget.By setting up a workflow with testing in Xcode Cloud,tests run in a stable, reliable, and reproducible environment.They run in the background while you are doing other work,freeing up your local environment,and they run automatically,freeing you up of having to remember to manually run them.To add a Test action,I just need to click on the Plus button and select Test.For Test actions, I can choose to make themrequired to pass or not.Marking the action as required means that the overall buildwill fail if this Test action fails.If I were building up my test suite,I may choose to set this as Not Required to Passso it doesn't affect the overall build state.When it comes to choosingwhich tests to run, I have a couple of options.I can choose Use Scheme Settingsto reference the settings in my Fruta iOS scheme,or I can select a particular test planif I want to hone in on a certain set of tests.Once I have that set, all that is left to dois to choose the simulators I want to run my tests on.Xcode Cloud provides a recommended option,which is a collectionof simulators with different screen sizes.The recommended option always tests against the Xcodeselected in the Environment section,but if I choose specific simulators,I can also select from a list of older OS versions.The last action I want to run is the Analyze action.The compiler is capable of automatically findingmany classes of bugs and warning us about them.Heeding and fixing these can save us a great dealof development time compared with tracking downthese issues at run timeand will give our users a much more stableand bug-free experience with our app.However, because running static analysisis not part of our typical local iterative development workflow,many of us forget to run it,only to see the issues mount up across the team over time.With Xcode Cloud, you could make sure thatstatic analysis runs every time you make a code change.To add an Analyze action, I'll click on the Plus button,and select Analyze.Like tests, I have the option to markstatic analysis issues as Required to Pass or not.Right now, I only want to monitor the resultsof static analysis, so I won't mark it as Required to Pass.The last action is the Build action.On occasion, you might need to runa simple Xcode Build action.This might be useful to make sure a particularsecondary build configuration or scheme still compiles,or perhaps to ensure that a framework that is partof your app can be built on its own.Now that I've set up the Archive, Test,and Analyze actions for my pull-request workflow,I'll hand it off to Kevin to add post-actions to this workflow.Thanks, Wesley.With Xcode Cloud workflows,you have the ability to configure post-actions.Post-actions run after all Build, Analyze, Test,and Archive actions have completed.The post-actions you can configure with Xcode Cloudare sending notifications and deploying with TestFlight.Let's first talk about notifications.There are two types of notification eventsyou can send.The first is when a build succeeds.You have the option to send notificationsfor all build successes; only fixes,which is when a branch or pull-request build transitionsfrom failing to passing;or don't notify.The other notification event is for when a build fails.You can send a notification for all build failures;only breaks, which is when a branch or pull-request buildtransitions from passing to failing; or don't notify.For this workflow, I want to notify my teamwhen pull-request builds finish.Below the Actions section is post-actions.To add a Notification action,I'll click the Plus button and select Notify.I'll leave All for Build Successand Build Failure.Below the Notification Events,I have a couple of options for where to send notifications.Xcode Cloud integrateswith the popular collaboration tool Slack.Once a Slack account has been authorized,I can click the Plus button to bring up a list of channels.I'll select the "ci-builds" channel and click OK.I also have the option to add email addresses.By default, all users automaticallyreceive notifications for the builds they kick off,so you don't have to add them to this list.However, if you have a group emailor if you have users who want to receive buildsthey did not kick off,you can add their email here.Finally, I'd like to share with youone of my favorite features of Xcode Cloud Workflows:the ability to automatically deploy with TestFlight.And now, with TestFlight on Mac,you can deploy to every platform Apple has to offer.There are two TestFlight deployment optionswith Xcode Cloud.Deploying to internal testers has been enhancedto quickly send buildsto members of your development team.Because they're members of your team,they can receive builds that were producedfrom pull requestsand builds without Clean selected.If you use TestFlight today,External Testing and App Store is equivalentto what you already know.It's recommended for candidate and release branchesand can be distributed to external testersand the App Store, subject to beta app review.TestFlight is a great way to get builds of your apponto devices of your teammatesand beta testers outside of your organization.You can configure a workflow to automaticallydeploy a build to any TestFlight group you have.You manage your TestFlight groupsthe same way you do today,in App Store Connect under the TestFlight tab.Here, I have multiple internal and external groups,and each one of them is available to me in my workflow.To automatically deploywith an internal TestFlight group,you'll need to do three things.First, you'll need to add an Archive action.Next, you'll need to set the Deployment optionon the archive to Internal Testing.Finally, you'll need to add a TestFlight Internal Testing post-action.Let's configure our workflow to do just that.I want this workflowto automatically deploy to my QA team.To do that, first, I'll click on the Archive iOS action,and select TestFlight Internal Testing Only.Doing this means my builds will be available in TestFlight.This is great if I don't want to automatically send buildsto anyone, but keep the option to do it laterfrom the TestFlight section on App Store Connect.For this app, I also want to deployto my colleagues automatically whenever a build is produced.To do that, I need to add a TestFlight post-action.I'll click the Plus button beside Post-Actions,and add TestFlight Internal Testing.The Archive iOS artifact is pre-selected,which is what I want.I'll hit the Plus button to add an internal group.Finally, I'll select the QA team.Now members of my QA team can verifyand test all features before they're mergedonto the Main branch.Sending a build to testers outside of your organizationwith TestFlight External Testingis a great way to get feedback on your appand its features before submitting to the App Store.This way, you can gain confidence in your changesfrom a wider set of usersand potentially make changes and fix issuesbefore it's released to the App Store.To deploy with TestFlight External Testing,a few more conditions need to be set.Select a single branch in the start condition.This ensures consistency in the buildsyou intend to send to your external beta testers.Next, select Clean in the Environment section.This guarantees your code will be builtfrom scratch, without using derived data.Lastly, set the Deployment settingin your Archive action to TestFlight and App Store.After all that is set,configuring the TestFlight External Testing post-actionis similar to configuring TestFlight Internal Testing.You simply add external groupsthat have been created in TestFlight.TestFlight External Testing also has the added abilityto deploy to individual testers.We've just created a pull-request workflowin Xcode,but you can also create, edit, and manage workflowsin App Store Connect.It's a great option if you're away from Xcodeand need to make changes to your workflows.Now back over to Justin to make a few recommendationson the types of workflows you can create for your team.Justin?Thanks, Kevin.I think the Fruta QA team will love accessing buildsfaster with our pull-request workflow.So as you've seen, workflows have a lot of powerand flexibility to model the way your teams work.You can create as many workflows as you needto get your work done.I know our team will create several.Kevin just showed you a workflow for pull requests,but here are a couple of ideasfor more workflows you and your team can try out.To show your app to usersoutside of your development team,you might distribute to an external TestFlight groupor submit your app to the App Store.The idea here is that I want to enforce high qualityso my app's users have a great experience.I need to run a workflow on the branchesdesignated for releases.It should execute a comprehensive battery of tests,archive the build, and, finally,deploy to an external TestFlight groupand into the hands of users.To better illustrate, let me show you my Release Workflow.To make sure my workflow will buildall of our future releases as well,I set the start condition to Every Change to a Branchon my Release branch.To be thorough, I want every buildfrom this workflow to be generated from scratch,so I checked Clean in the Environment section.Doing so typically increases build timessince everything is compiled again,but it gives us confidence that there are no issuescaused by caching.Notice that I also selected specific versions of Xcodeand macOS for this workflow.Pinning the tools down is an important partof converging and finalizing a release.To ensure that our app will workacross the range of users' iPhones and iPads,I run our tests on a variety of simulatorsin the Test section.To distribute the build of our app via TestFlight,I included an Archive actionand set the deployment preparationto TestFlight and App Store.To ensure our beta testersalways get the most up-to-date build,I set up a post-actionto deploy to our external TestFlight group.When new code is merged into our release branch,it gets automatically built, tested,and deployed to our beta testers.Now we can get feedback quickly on our changeswhile maintaining confidence that the quality remains high.Here's another workflow you might want to createthat performs a deeper set of testing every night.My Overnight Testing workflow runs periodically,testing against multiple simulatorsto cover as many platforms as I need.Any test failures get reported to the QA team,and since the focus is entirely on testing,there's no need to deploy a build anywhere.I set my start condition to run this workflowevery weeknight by choosing On a Schedule for a Branchas my start condition typewith weekly frequency.Then, I selected my days as Monday through Fridayat 1:00 a.m.In the Environment section,I selected the latest Xcode version to make sureour app builds successfully as new tools are released.I want to thoroughly test our app,so I selected a few test plansand simulators that are required to pass.I also want to run static analysis,so I added an Analyze action and also require that to pass.Should any of the previous tests fail,the QA team will find out with a Notify post-action.I set Build Success to Don't Notify,and Build Failure to All.My QA team has their own Slack channel,but I could also specify an email address.Either way, the QA team will find outabout any build failures by the following morning.Running a workflow like thisis a great way to save timesince you and your team can keep developing during the dayand leave Xcode Cloud to thoroughly test your appat night.And lastly, under the Product menu in Xcodeis Manage Workflows,where I can take a look at all the workflows our team uses.I see the Overnight Testing workflowthat I just createdalong with the workflowsthat Wesley and Kevin created earlier.As our project grows, I can add more, edit,or remove workflows to suit the team's needs.And that's it for our team's workflows.We've shown you how to create workflows for pull requests,how to configure actions for different platforms,how to distribute releases to TestFlight users,and how to set up overnight testing.But there are so many more thingsyou could do with workflows.On top of that,you can even create and manage those workflowsfrom App Store Connect.To learn even more about workflows,check out "Customize Your Advanced Xcode Cloud Workflows."If you haven't had a chance yet,watch "Meet Xcode Cloud"to learn how to onboard your project.There are also other great sessions that dive deeperinto cloud signing and Xcode's new support for pull requests.Xcode Cloud gives your team the ability to create flexible,extensible workflows that can adaptto the way you workand help make sure the team consistently followstheir development practices.I hope this session helps you create workflowsto leverage as you and your team iteratedevelopment and deliver a high-quality app.Thank you for watching, and enjoy the rest of WWDC.[music]

Hello, and welcome to this sessionon Xcode Cloud workflows.My name is Justin, and I'm an engineerwith the TestFlight team, and along with my colleagues,Wesley and Kevin, we're here to introducethe ins and outs of creating your workflows in Xcode Cloud.Workflows are at the heart of Xcode Cloudand drive the continuous integrationthat enables you and your teamto automate building, analyzing, testing, archiving,and distributing your apps and frameworks.They are flexible and extensible,so you can customize workflows around your team'sexisting development and distribution processes.And with Xcode Cloud,workflow management is integratedinto the Apple developer tools you already use:Xcode and App Store Connect.In this session, let's break workflowsdown into their specific components.First, we'll walk through how to configure the conditionsthat automatically run your workflow.Then, we'll talk about the optionsfor setting up your environment.We'll also show you how to create multiple actionsfor the tasks you want to automate,along with actions to run afterward,like sending notifications about your builds,or automatically deploying those builds to TestFlight.Finally, we have some strategies for differentworkflows you may find useful and super convenientto boost your team's collaboration and productivity.We have a lot to cover, so let's get started.Let me hand it off to Wesley.

Thanks, Justin!I'm collaborating on an app called Frutawith members of my developer team.It is already up and running on Xcode Cloud.If you haven't yet seen the session"Meet Xcode Cloud," be sure to check it out to learnabout setting up your first workflow.Right here, integrated in Xcode's Report Navigator,is a new Cloud tab,where I see the workflows and builds from my team.When I onboarded the Fruta app, it created a default workflowfor me that builds the main branch.This workflow has been working great for us,but because we're a team that also uses pull requests,I'd like to create a pull-request-specific workflowthat my team can leverage.I'd like it to run every time a pull request is createdby anyone on my team,analyze, test, and archive my app,notify my team when a pull-request build finishes,and deliver a version of my app to members of my teamso they can test out the features before they're mergedinto our main integration branch.Creating a workflow is easy to do.Under the Product menu, I can go to Manage Workflows,click Plus, and select my app.

This will bring track a new workflow editor.A workflow is made up of several configurable components.Here's the general section, where I can name my workflow.I'm gonna name this "Pull Requests."If I were on a team where only a small numberof individuals are responsible for makingchanges to our workflows,I can choose to restrict editing to prevent unintended updatesthat might impact our team.By default,Xcode Cloud sets the primary repositoryand project information with the knowledgeof my local settings,but if I ever decide to move my primary repositoryor migrate from an Xcode project to a workspace,I can change those settings here.Next, let's take a look at the Start Condition section.This is where I can define when I want my workflow to run.

Xcode Cloud has a number of condition types.For this workflow, I want to set its start conditionto run for all pull requeststhat intend to merge into the main branch.To do that, I can select from the Type menuand choose Every Change to a Pull Request.This condition type allows me to specify the sourceand target branch.

I'll set the source branch to Any Branchand the target branch to Main.

Now every time a team member creates a pull requestagainst Main and makes changes to it,Xcode Cloud will automatically run this workflow.When building pull requests, Xcode Cloud will now buildand test the merge of the source and target branch together,so my team members can be confidentand know the real impact of their changeswith the rest of the team.I can also narrow those conditionsto specific files or foldersand choose to set whether or not I want to auto-cancelany previously running builds when the workflow runs.This is useful if I push one commiton top of another in quick succession.Every Change to a Pull Request is just oneof the start conditions that you can set for a workflow,and depending on the needs of your team,we have other condition typesthat you can configure to meet those needs.Every Change to a Branch will always buildthe source branchand will ignore any pull-request states.Every Change to a Tag will build whenevernew tags are created.On a Schedule will build a branchof your choosing on a recurring schedule that you can choose.This is great if you have long-running teststhat you want to run on occasion.Now that I have configured the start condition,which dictates when this workflow will run,let's configure the Environment section,which dictates how the workflow will run.Xcode Cloud runs on Apple's Cloud Infrastructureand makes available various macOS and Xcode versions.

To choose your Xcode and macOS version,you just need to select it from a menu.You can also set your workflow to point to the Latest Releaseor Beta version, so you could always buildor test on the latest software.As developers, we all care deeplyabout our productivity, and a large part of thatis the performance of the tools we use.Many of you will be working on large projectswith many files and deal with potentially long build times.Just as locally within Xcode,you have the option to build your changes incrementallyby just building the files that have changed.You also have this option in Xcode Cloud.This typically leads to faster builds.However, there are times when you mightwanna perform a clean build instead.This is important to make sure everything is functioningin your final build, and is also required to producebuilds that could be deployed to External Beta Testerswith TestFlight or to submit to the App Store.In the environment section,I have the option to select Clean.Since this is a pull-request workflow,I'll leave it unchecked so I can take advantageof the performance benefits.Every team works in its own unique way,and teams need their tools to have the flexibilityto be able to work the way they want to work.Xcode Cloud provides options to do what we believeare the most common development tasks out of the box.However, it also provides a rangeof options for extensibility.This extensibility allows you to connect Xcode Cloudwith the other tools and systemsyour teams use to get your work done.Xcode Cloud offers a comprehensive APIto access your data, configure workflows, and kick off builds.In addition to the existing scripting optionsthat Xcode provides,Xcode adds the ability to create custom scriptsthat run on the deviceswhich are performing your builds and tests.In the Environment section,I can specify environment variablesthat Xcode Cloud makes available to custom scripts.This is useful for configuration and secretsthat I don't want to check into the source code repository.

I also have the ability to mark an environment variableas secret to provide an extra level of protection.You can find further information on thisin the "Customize your Advanced Xcode Cloud Workflows" sessionor in our documentation.So far, we've shown you howto configure when your workflows run and when they run.What environment should they run in?Next, let's talk about actions.Actions define the work that you want the workflow to dofor you and your team every time the workflow runs.The key actions you could ask Xcode to perform locallyare now all available to you within Xcode Cloud:building,running static analysis,testing,and archiving.The actions I want to set up are the Archive,Test, and Analyze actions.Let's start by adding the Archive actionby clicking the plus icon by Actionsand selecting Archive.

I need to select the platform and the schemeI want to create an archive for.It already pre-selected the iOS platformand the iOS scheme, which is exactly what I wanted.I also have the option to registerfor TestFlight or make it ready for App Store distribution,but more on this later.You may notice that I didn't have to manageprovisioning profiles or code-signing identities.Xcode Cloud handles this automatically for you.To learn more about this,check out the session"Distribute Apps in Xcode with Cloud Signing."Now that the Archive action is set up,let's focus our attention on the Test action.Testing your apps is an incrediblyimportant part of the development process.Not only does it help ensure your users experiencefewer bugs, but it can speed up your development processby giving you confidence in the changes you are making.However, sometimes it can be cumbersome and slowto run your tests locally,and sometimes, you might just forget.By setting up a workflow with testing in Xcode Cloud,tests run in a stable, reliable, and reproducible environment.They run in the background while you are doing other work,freeing up your local environment,and they run automatically,freeing you up of having to remember to manually run them.To add a Test action,I just need to click on the Plus button and select Test.

For Test actions, I can choose to make themrequired to pass or not.Marking the action as required means that the overall buildwill fail if this Test action fails.If I were building up my test suite,I may choose to set this as Not Required to Passso it doesn't affect the overall build state.When it comes to choosingwhich tests to run, I have a couple of options.I can choose Use Scheme Settingsto reference the settings in my Fruta iOS scheme,or I can select a particular test planif I want to hone in on a certain set of tests.Once I have that set, all that is left to dois to choose the simulators I want to run my tests on.Xcode Cloud provides a recommended option,which is a collectionof simulators with different screen sizes.The recommended option always tests against the Xcodeselected in the Environment section,but if I choose specific simulators,I can also select from a list of older OS versions.

The last action I want to run is the Analyze action.The compiler is capable of automatically findingmany classes of bugs and warning us about them.Heeding and fixing these can save us a great dealof development time compared with tracking downthese issues at run timeand will give our users a much more stableand bug-free experience with our app.However, because running static analysisis not part of our typical local iterative development workflow,many of us forget to run it,only to see the issues mount up across the team over time.With Xcode Cloud, you could make sure thatstatic analysis runs every time you make a code change.To add an Analyze action, I'll click on the Plus button,and select Analyze.

Like tests, I have the option to markstatic analysis issues as Required to Pass or not.Right now, I only want to monitor the resultsof static analysis, so I won't mark it as Required to Pass.

The last action is the Build action.On occasion, you might need to runa simple Xcode Build action.This might be useful to make sure a particularsecondary build configuration or scheme still compiles,or perhaps to ensure that a framework that is partof your app can be built on its own.Now that I've set up the Archive, Test,and Analyze actions for my pull-request workflow,I'll hand it off to Kevin to add post-actions to this workflow.Thanks, Wesley.With Xcode Cloud workflows,you have the ability to configure post-actions.Post-actions run after all Build, Analyze, Test,and Archive actions have completed.The post-actions you can configure with Xcode Cloudare sending notifications and deploying with TestFlight.Let's first talk about notifications.There are two types of notification eventsyou can send.The first is when a build succeeds.You have the option to send notificationsfor all build successes; only fixes,which is when a branch or pull-request build transitionsfrom failing to passing;or don't notify.The other notification event is for when a build fails.You can send a notification for all build failures;only breaks, which is when a branch or pull-request buildtransitions from passing to failing; or don't notify.For this workflow, I want to notify my teamwhen pull-request builds finish.Below the Actions section is post-actions.To add a Notification action,I'll click the Plus button and select Notify.

I'll leave All for Build Successand Build Failure.Below the Notification Events,I have a couple of options for where to send notifications.Xcode Cloud integrateswith the popular collaboration tool Slack.Once a Slack account has been authorized,I can click the Plus button to bring up a list of channels.

I'll select the "ci-builds" channel and click OK.

I also have the option to add email addresses.By default, all users automaticallyreceive notifications for the builds they kick off,so you don't have to add them to this list.However, if you have a group emailor if you have users who want to receive buildsthey did not kick off,you can add their email here.Finally, I'd like to share with youone of my favorite features of Xcode Cloud Workflows:the ability to automatically deploy with TestFlight.And now, with TestFlight on Mac,you can deploy to every platform Apple has to offer.There are two TestFlight deployment optionswith Xcode Cloud.Deploying to internal testers has been enhancedto quickly send buildsto members of your development team.Because they're members of your team,they can receive builds that were producedfrom pull requestsand builds without Clean selected.If you use TestFlight today,External Testing and App Store is equivalentto what you already know.It's recommended for candidate and release branchesand can be distributed to external testersand the App Store, subject to beta app review.TestFlight is a great way to get builds of your apponto devices of your teammatesand beta testers outside of your organization.You can configure a workflow to automaticallydeploy a build to any TestFlight group you have.You manage your TestFlight groupsthe same way you do today,in App Store Connect under the TestFlight tab.Here, I have multiple internal and external groups,and each one of them is available to me in my workflow.To automatically deploywith an internal TestFlight group,you'll need to do three things.First, you'll need to add an Archive action.Next, you'll need to set the Deployment optionon the archive to Internal Testing.Finally, you'll need to add a TestFlight Internal Testing post-action.Let's configure our workflow to do just that.I want this workflowto automatically deploy to my QA team.To do that, first, I'll click on the Archive iOS action,and select TestFlight Internal Testing Only.

Doing this means my builds will be available in TestFlight.This is great if I don't want to automatically send buildsto anyone, but keep the option to do it laterfrom the TestFlight section on App Store Connect.For this app, I also want to deployto my colleagues automatically whenever a build is produced.To do that, I need to add a TestFlight post-action.I'll click the Plus button beside Post-Actions,and add TestFlight Internal Testing.

The Archive iOS artifact is pre-selected,which is what I want.I'll hit the Plus button to add an internal group.

Finally, I'll select the QA team.

Now members of my QA team can verifyand test all features before they're mergedonto the Main branch.Sending a build to testers outside of your organizationwith TestFlight External Testingis a great way to get feedback on your appand its features before submitting to the App Store.This way, you can gain confidence in your changesfrom a wider set of usersand potentially make changes and fix issuesbefore it's released to the App Store.To deploy with TestFlight External Testing,a few more conditions need to be set.Select a single branch in the start condition.This ensures consistency in the buildsyou intend to send to your external beta testers.Next, select Clean in the Environment section.This guarantees your code will be builtfrom scratch, without using derived data.Lastly, set the Deployment settingin your Archive action to TestFlight and App Store.After all that is set,configuring the TestFlight External Testing post-actionis similar to configuring TestFlight Internal Testing.You simply add external groupsthat have been created in TestFlight.TestFlight External Testing also has the added abilityto deploy to individual testers.We've just created a pull-request workflowin Xcode,but you can also create, edit, and manage workflowsin App Store Connect.It's a great option if you're away from Xcodeand need to make changes to your workflows.Now back over to Justin to make a few recommendationson the types of workflows you can create for your team.Justin?Thanks, Kevin.I think the Fruta QA team will love accessing buildsfaster with our pull-request workflow.So as you've seen, workflows have a lot of powerand flexibility to model the way your teams work.You can create as many workflows as you needto get your work done.I know our team will create several.Kevin just showed you a workflow for pull requests,but here are a couple of ideasfor more workflows you and your team can try out.To show your app to usersoutside of your development team,you might distribute to an external TestFlight groupor submit your app to the App Store.The idea here is that I want to enforce high qualityso my app's users have a great experience.I need to run a workflow on the branchesdesignated for releases.It should execute a comprehensive battery of tests,archive the build, and, finally,deploy to an external TestFlight groupand into the hands of users.To better illustrate, let me show you my Release Workflow.To make sure my workflow will buildall of our future releases as well,I set the start condition to Every Change to a Branchon my Release branch.To be thorough, I want every buildfrom this workflow to be generated from scratch,so I checked Clean in the Environment section.Doing so typically increases build timessince everything is compiled again,but it gives us confidence that there are no issuescaused by caching.Notice that I also selected specific versions of Xcodeand macOS for this workflow.Pinning the tools down is an important partof converging and finalizing a release.To ensure that our app will workacross the range of users' iPhones and iPads,I run our tests on a variety of simulatorsin the Test section.To distribute the build of our app via TestFlight,I included an Archive actionand set the deployment preparationto TestFlight and App Store.To ensure our beta testersalways get the most up-to-date build,I set up a post-actionto deploy to our external TestFlight group.When new code is merged into our release branch,it gets automatically built, tested,and deployed to our beta testers.Now we can get feedback quickly on our changeswhile maintaining confidence that the quality remains high.Here's another workflow you might want to createthat performs a deeper set of testing every night.My Overnight Testing workflow runs periodically,testing against multiple simulatorsto cover as many platforms as I need.Any test failures get reported to the QA team,and since the focus is entirely on testing,there's no need to deploy a build anywhere.I set my start condition to run this workflowevery weeknight by choosing On a Schedule for a Branchas my start condition typewith weekly frequency.Then, I selected my days as Monday through Fridayat 1:00 a.m.In the Environment section,I selected the latest Xcode version to make sureour app builds successfully as new tools are released.I want to thoroughly test our app,so I selected a few test plansand simulators that are required to pass.I also want to run static analysis,so I added an Analyze action and also require that to pass.Should any of the previous tests fail,the QA team will find out with a Notify post-action.I set Build Success to Don't Notify,and Build Failure to All.My QA team has their own Slack channel,but I could also specify an email address.Either way, the QA team will find outabout any build failures by the following morning.Running a workflow like thisis a great way to save timesince you and your team can keep developing during the dayand leave Xcode Cloud to thoroughly test your appat night.And lastly, under the Product menu in Xcodeis Manage Workflows,where I can take a look at all the workflows our team uses.I see the Overnight Testing workflowthat I just createdalong with the workflowsthat Wesley and Kevin created earlier.As our project grows, I can add more, edit,or remove workflows to suit the team's needs.And that's it for our team's workflows.We've shown you how to create workflows for pull requests,how to configure actions for different platforms,how to distribute releases to TestFlight users,and how to set up overnight testing.But there are so many more thingsyou could do with workflows.On top of that,you can even create and manage those workflowsfrom App Store Connect.To learn even more about workflows,check out "Customize Your Advanced Xcode Cloud Workflows."If you haven't had a chance yet,watch "Meet Xcode Cloud"to learn how to onboard your project.There are also other great sessions that dive deeperinto cloud signing and Xcode's new support for pull requests.Xcode Cloud gives your team the ability to create flexible,extensible workflows that can adaptto the way you workand help make sure the team consistently followstheir development practices.I hope this session helps you create workflowsto leverage as you and your team iteratedevelopment and deliver a high-quality app.Thank you for watching, and enjoy the rest of WWDC.[music]
