Search this video…Welcome to "What's New in UIKit"in iOS 15.My name is Michael and later I'll be joinedby my colleague Jamie.iOS 15 is packed full of amazing new technology and features.We've updated UIKit in some exciting ways to help youadopt these new capabilities.Together, Jamie and I will cover productivity updates,UI refinements, API enhancements,performance improvements,as well as some new security and privacy features.Productivity is at the heart of iPadOS,and this year is no exception,with updates to iPad Multitasking,keyboard navigation, keyboard shortcuts,and iPad pointer, just to name a few.Let's start with a short demo of how we've updatedMultitasking to take iPad to the next level.In Mail, we are using the newcenter scene Multitasking feature to make iteasier than ever to focus on a single message.Just long press on a message to openthe context menu and select “Open in New Window."This will open the message in its own UIWindowScenein the center of the screen.This is a great way to focus on the task at hand.The new center scene can also be moved to Split Viewusing drag and drop,or by choosing the Split View option in the newMultitasking menu at the top of the window scene.Alternately, you can swipe down on the Multitasking menuand dock the scene in the new window shelf.Adding this functionality to your app is as simpleas creating a new window scene activation action.This action takes a closure that returnsan activation configuration, created with an NSUserActivitythat can be handled by your app.Add this action to a context menu and you're all set.With iPadOS 13.4 we introduced the Magic Keyboardand a pointer.In iPadOS 15 we've improved pointer supportby adding band selection.In addition to providing new API,we've enabled band selection by defaultfor UICollectionViews that support multi-selection.We've also added pointer accessories that allow youto communicate additional context or hint at functionalityby combining secondary shapes with any pointer style.Multiple accessories can be displayed at a timeand positioned around the pointer.They have the same fluid nature as the pointer,and the system seamlessly animatesbetween different accessory shapes and positions.In iPadOS 15, we've completely redesignedthe keyboard shortcut menu.With categorized shortcuts and built-in search,finding the shortcut you're looking forhas never been easier.The new Keyboard Shortcut menu also provides increased paritybetween iPad and Mac Catalyst versions of your app.To take full advantage of these new features,you need to adopt UIMenuBuilder.Implement buildMenuWithBuilderon your UIApplicationDelegate.Assign commands to one of the pre-defined categoriessuch as “View" or “File"or even create your own custom category.To use categories, you will need to audit your applicationfor uses of UIResponder's keyCommands property.Move any commands assigned to this propertyto the buildMenuWithBuilder function.To learn more about Multitasking, iPad pointer,and the new Keyboard Shortcut menu, we have an amazing videoall about taking your iPad appsto the next level.We've also added rich support for focus basedkeyboard navigation in iPadOS 15.If you're already familiar with the focus system on tvOS,then you'll be happy to knowit's now available in iPadOS as well.In fact, all focus navigation in tvOS,CarPlay, iPadOS, and Mac Catalystare now built on UIFocusSystem.With UIFocusSystem on iPad and Mac Catalyst,the arrow keys are used to move between focus itemsand the tab key to move between focus groups.In this example, the Mail application is usingUISplitViewController with a sidebar,and when using these standard UIKit components,keyboard navigation as demonstratedwill be enabled by default in iPadOS 15.Check out "Focus on keyboard navigation"to learn more about supporting keyboard navigationin your app.Another essential productivity feature of iOSis multi-touch Drag and Drop.Introduced in iOS 11, Drag and Drophas been an essential productivity enhancement.With one simple gesture, you can seamlessly move data withinthe application and on iPadOS even between applications.With iOS 15, UIKit has enabledinter-app drag and drop on iPhone as well,unlocking many exciting new interactions.For example, It's now easier than ever to quicklyshare an idea for a new watch band with a friend.With one gesture, you can simply drag a photofrom Safari right into a Messages conversation.The Drag and Drop APIs have not changed to supportthis expanded capability.For a refresh of the technical details,we have four great videos from 2017that go in-depth on how to take advantage of Drag and Drop.Next, I'll show you some of the UI refinementsin iOS 15.We refined the appearance of UIToolbar and UITabBar.This updated look removes the background materialwhen scrolled to bottom,giving more visual clarity to your content.In UITabBar, we've enhanced support for SF Symbols,giving great results when using any of your favorite symbols.While UIKit does its best to make this new appearanceseamless in your app,there are a few issues you may encounter.You should audit your code for places where youmay be setting a bar's translucent property to falseand check for any UIViewControllersthat have non-standard edgesForExtendedLayout.Both of these conditions will cause visual issueswith the new appearance.If the new default behavior is not appropriate for your app,just create a custom appearance and assign itto the scrollEdgeAppearance property on your bar.This property was previously only availableon UINavigationBar but is now also availableon UIToolbar and UITabBar.Setting a custom appearance will avoid any of the visual issuescauses by the previously mentioned incompatible APIs.Additionally, it is possible UIKit won'tbe able to infer the proper scroll view for observationwhen performing the new scroll edge appearance transitions.To directly specify the scrollView,we've added a new function on UIViewController —setContentScrollView for edge.Look at all your bars.Make sure the appearance is what you expect.Be sure to check anywhere you've done somethingspecial — it might need extra attention.We have a new appearance for headers in iOS 15.For plain lists, section headers now display seamlesslyin line with the content,and only display a visible background materialwhen becoming pinned to the top as you scroll down.In addition, there's new padding insertedabove each section header to visually separatethe sections with this new design.You should use this plain style in conjunction with index barsfor fast scrubbing when list content is longas demonstrated in the Contacts app.UIKit also offers a grouped style.This is for use in UI that doesn't containa lot of custom or visually rich content.This is a great choice for configuration UIor registration flows similar to what you'd findin the Settings app.The prominent header style is very similar to the existingsidebar header style used for sidebar lists on iPad.Prominent headers are a great choice to usewhen adapting a .sidebar list to an .insetGrouped listin a compact size class.The alarm tab in the Clock app makes great useof this new style.And finally, we have a new extra prominent grouped stylefor use with content that is visually richso that headers maintain hierarchyand avoid becoming lost.Check out the Watch app's Face Galleryto see this style in action.To access all of these great header styles,use the UIListContentConfiguration APIintroduced in iOS 14.In iOS 14.5 we introduced UIListSeparatorConfigurationthat allows full control over separators in a list.You can specify a configuration for the entire list,or you can override the system-generated appearanceon a per-row basis, giving you full control over separators.Sheets in iOS 15 gain the ability to only coverhalf the screen, displayed at what we callthe medium height detent.With this new half height functionality,you can optionally disable dimming behind this detentto create a non-modal experienceallowing interaction both within and behind the sheet.Watch "Customize and resize sheets in UIKit"to learn about all the ways we've enhanced sheets in iOS 15.Next up UIDatePicker.And yes, In iOS 15, we are reintroducingthe wheels of time.But now, you can simply tap the timeto use the keyboard for input.And with Magic Keyboard on iPad,you can even edit the time right in-line.Of course, you can still tap the screento reveal those beautiful wheels.And with that, I'll hand it off to my colleague Jamie.Thanks, Mike!I'm going to start out looking at some moreenhancements to UIKit APIs in iOS 15.Our first API enhancements is in many waysalso a UI refinement.We've added new APIs to UIButton, to allow youto flexibly configure your button's look and feel.As well as the existing Plain style, we've added Gray,which has a gray background,Tinted, which has a tinted background,and Filled, which is entirely opaque.In addition to the new styles, buttons now better supportresizing in response to the system "text size" settingknown as Dynamic Type, and for the first timeformally support multi-line text.These changes, and the new UIButton.Configuration APIthat enables them,don't just make buttons more powerful,they're also more customizable and easy to update.Together with the UIMenu additions to buttonsreleased in iOS 14,UIButtonConfiguration allows you to make pop-upand pull-down buttons natively in UIKit for the first time.And, of course, if you're using UIKit on Mac,and you've chosen in Xcode to "Optimize Interface For Mac",these buttons all look and behavejust as you'd expect them to.Here's an example of how easy the API is to use.Just create a button configuration.This constructor gives the Tinted style.The configuration's propertiesare used to customize the button.And then instantiate the button, passing in the configuration.It's not shown here, but the only thing leftis to add an action, and add the button to your view.There's a lot more to UIButtonConfiguration than Ican cover here, so there is a full video covering it,and other improvements to UIButton, in detail.Check out "Meet the UIKit Button System"to learn all about the button APIs.UIContextMenuInteraction on iOS and iPadOSnow supports collapsible submenus.They appear when you tap on any item with a chevronlike the "Sort By" item in this menu.There's no new API for this.The UIMenu API already supports submenus,but prior to iOS 15, they replaced the current menuentirely when you tapped on them.This is also discussed a little more in the"Meet the UIKit Button System" video.In iOS 13, we introduced SF Symbols —hundreds of scalable symbols that look greatnext to our San Francisco fonts.In iOS 15, these get even better.Not only are there additional symbols, but we've addedthe ability to use colors in three new ways:Hierarchical, Palette, and Multicolor.Monochrome symbols are the single-color tintable imagesyou already know and love.Hierarchical symbols apply a singleruntime-specified tint color to a hierarchy of layers.Palette symbols allow multiple colorsto be explicitly specified.And Multicolor symbols,previously available only in AppKit and SwiftUI,have a fixed multicolor representation.New APIs for using all these colorful modesare available in UIKit, SwiftUI, and AppKit.The APIs are really easy to use.This code sets up a UIImageSymbolConfigurationto use the system orange color as a basis for hierarchical tinting,and then uses that to create this image of a hierarchically tintedorange sun symbol.If you regularly use SFSymbols,you know they come in a few style variants.For example, filled, on circles or on rectangles.In previous releases, these are selected by specifying dotted strings.In iOS 15, there is a new UIImage APIthat makes working with these variants super easy,whether you want to specify the type up-front,or to generate a variant of an existing image.This is the symbol represented by the "heart" string,and two of its variants, which can now be selected in code.There are lots of videos about all aspects of SF Symbols in the "Design and buildSF Symbols" collection, and I encourage you to check them all out.There's more on the UIKit API specifically in "SF Symbols in UIKit and AppKit."UIContentSizeCategory traits represent the system textsize setting, also called the dynamic type size, in code.You can set your labels, textfields, textviews, and image views —perhaps containing SFSymbols — to automatically adjust to the setting.In iOS 15, we've added a new way to restricthow the traits are applied to view hierarchies.This enables you to easily set a floor or ceiling for the size.This can be a great help when you're making sureyour app's text and images look great at every text size setting.Here, Clock is limiting how small its large time labels get.Please do not use this API to unduly limit text size.These settings serve an extremely important function,and it's paramount that your app's functionality is all available,and everything is legible, to people using the highest text size setting.So as another example, you might use this to limitthe growth of a headline that's already very large at the default size.We've unified the system colors across all of our platforms.What does this mean for UIKit?Well, there are some subtle changes to some of the colors,and some colors previously only available in other frameworksare now also available in UIKit wherever your app is running.So if you've been itching to use systemMintor systemBrown in your UIKit app, now is the time.Also new is UIColor.tintColor.It's a color that's resolved at runtime, based on the appor trait hierarchy's current tint color.It's perfect for using with the new UIButton.Configuration,and the new colorful SF Symbols APIs.Along with UIColor, there are also enhancementsto the UIColorPicker ViewController,the standard interface for mixing and picking colors.In iOS 14.5, there's a new callback,colorPickerViewController(didSelect:continuously:),that allows app UI to be updated as the color is mixed and changed,as well as when the picking is complete.TextKit 2 is the new, next-generation text layout systemavailable in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and macOS.It's a powerful new system that makes it easierto express what you want to do with text,and it does it in a fast, high performance way.UIKit has adopted it behind the scenes to power UITextField,where it brings better layout to textin languages with complex scripts, like Kannadawith no adoption required.If you want to know more about TextKit 2, what it can do,and how to use it in your apps, watch "Meet TextKit 2."A UISceneSession represents an instance of your application's UI,and corresponds to an app window represented in the app switcher.Interface state is represented by an NSUserActivity.Your app provides this NSUserActivity to the systemwhen a scene enters the background,and should use it to restore the interface statewhen the scene is reinstantiated.In iPadOS 15, there are a few new APIs to make this easier.There's a new way to get and setthe transient state of our text input views.There's a new UIScene callback that providesa more convenient place to restore state after a storyboard loads.And there's an opportunity to extend the app launch processand delay when your app's UI becomes activeif you have asynchronous model code that returns state.All our engineering efforts are focused on the UIScene-based APIs.If you're still using the old UIApplication-based lifecyclefrom before UIScene was introduced in iPadOS 13,now is the time to switch to UIScene.All UIKit apps can use it. Supporting multiple windows is not required,although, for iPad and Mac apps, it is a great idea.For a refresher on UIScene, and more details on the enhancedstate restoration APIs, watch "Take your iPad apps to the next level."Speaking of scenes, in UIKit in iOS 15,there are new APIs that allow apps to representthe currently sharable content that's being interacted with in each scene.They're used by the new Siri "Share This" feature on iOS and Mac,and by the NSSharingServicePickerToolbarItemon Mac Catalyst.There are a lot more details in the "Design great actions for Shortcuts,Siri, and Suggestions,"and "Qualities of a great Mac Catalyst app" videos.For our last API enhancements, we'll return to our dear friends,UICollectionView and UITableView.In iOS 14, we introduced new APIs to allow you to configurethe look and feel of cells much more easily and consistently than in the past.In iOS 15, new closure-based update handlersmake it easier than ever to reconfigure your cells.No longer do you need to create a cell subclass and overrideupdateConfiguration using state.You can now write that code inline,in the same place you create the cells.Here, we're greying out our text when the cell is disabled.Similar closure-based functions are available inthe new UIButtonConfiguration APIs too.We've improved diffable data source to make it easier to updateyour collection and table views.In iOS 15, when you apply a snapshot without animating differences,the UI updates based on those changes without discarding all the existing cells.And there's new API to efficiently reconfigure items,so you can update the content displayed in existing cellswhen the properties of items change without their identity changing.Every device that UIKit runs on has multiple processor cores,and powerful graphics hardware.Things should happen fast. Animations and scrolling should always be smooth.In iOS 15, there are a few enhancements and new APIsthat make buildings apps with these characteristics even easier.Let's talk about a few of the ones that are available in UIKit.First, we'll return to UICollectionView and UITableView.iOS 15 introduces changes to cell prefetching.These changes automatically take effect when you build for iOS 15.They can give apps up to twice the amount of time —almost two visual frame's worth —to prepare cells while keeping scrolling perfectly smooth.Many cells show images.In the past, you might have noticed momentary interruptions in scrollingwhen the main UI queue is tied up decoding large images.In iOS 15, app code can take more control over this process.There are new easy functions to prepare images so they're completely readywhen your app needs to display them.And these functions are easy to use asynchronously,so the UI queue can be free to process events while the images are being decoded.Many apps handle large images, but display them at small sizes.To help with this, there are new UIImage APIsthat resize images more efficiently — and save memory —by using the system's knowledge about the images and the display.For more details of these collection view and image improvements, information abouthow you can take advantage them, and some other great performance tips,check out "Make blazing fast lists and collection views."Swift has introduced new featuresthat make writing asynchronous code easier than ever.Most UIKit APIs must be called on the main UI queue,and we've annotated those APIs as Main Actor to ensurethat this is enforced, for the first time, at compile time.In other areas, like the new UIImage preparation features,we've tweaked our APIs to ensure that UIKit is easy and safe to usewith the new asynchronous Swift language features.Check out "Meet async/await in Swift" and "Meet AsyncSequence"to get going with this new way of developing asynchronous code.Now, security and privacy.We've built some new technology into iOS 15 that allows the systemto verify what interface is really being interacted with.We've integrated this into UIKit in a few places,and here, I'm going to talk about three that might affect your app.First, the Location Button.OS 15 introduces a new APIs allow apps to embed buttons that grant case-by-case,one-time access to the device's current location.They do this when, and only when, they are tapped onwithout lots of alerts or prompts.The API is flexible, so it can match every app's look,but behind the scenes, it ensures buttons are always clear and legible,or they won't work.There's a whole video discussing how to embed this into any app,"Meet the Location Button"I'm sure you've noticed this banner, introduced in iOS 14.It's shown when an app access data that's been copiedonto the pasteboard in a different app.In iOS 15, we're eliminating the banner any time the system can confirmthat the data was accessed after deliberate interactionwith a standard system paste interface.For example, a tap on the paste button in the editing menu,or a Cmd-V on a hardware keyboard.We've also added API to provide few new standard Paste menu items.When these are used, the notification banner is also not displayed.We provide new ways to specify "Paste," "Paste and Go,""Paste and Search," and "Paste and Match Style."For each of these, there are standard UIResponder selectors —for use with UIMenuController and UICommand —and new identifiers — for use with UIAction.Sometimes an app wants more informationabout what's on the pasteboard, but doesn't need full access.In iOS 14, we introduced an API that apps can use to check if there is a number,probable web URL, or probable web search term on the pasteboard.And we use these ourselves in Calculator and Safari.In iOS 15, this API has been greatly expandedto cover all the standard Data Detectors types.None of these will show the notice, because they don't grant accessto the data itself.There are also APIs to retrieve the data values without having to parsethe text yourself, although if these APIs used at any time other than after the useof a standard paste interface, the system will show the paste notice.Our last privacy enhancement was new in iOS 14.5, and built on an early versionof the technology that powers the location and paste interfaces.UIEventAttribution was developed in conjunction with the WebKit team.WebKit's Private Click Measurement feature provides Web-to-Web Click Measurement.UIEventAttribution brings PCM to UIKit, and provides App-to-Web Click Measurement.This means privacy-preserving measurement of ad clicks and taps.It's easy to use — just cover your ads with UIEventAttributionViews,and pass a UIEventAttribution objectalong with any URLs you open in response to ad taps.To learn more about this, see the "Meet privacy-preserving ad attribution" video.There's also a great WebKit.org blog post entitled"Introducing Private Click Measurement."Well, that was quite a whirlwind, and we didn't even cover everything that's new.What's next?Please go and compile your app using the iOS 15 SDK.Test out new features like Drag and Drop on iPhone and our enhanced system colors.Adopt the new iOS 15 look with new buttons,bars, lists and symbols.Adopt our new iPad features for better multitasking,keyboard, and trackpad support.And use the new UIKit APIs to respect user privacy,and make even better, even faster apps, even more easily.Thank you.

Welcome to "What's New in UIKit"in iOS 15.My name is Michael and later I'll be joinedby my colleague Jamie.

iOS 15 is packed full of amazing new technology and features.We've updated UIKit in some exciting ways to help youadopt these new capabilities.

In previous releases, these are selected by specifying dotted strings.In iOS 15, there is a new UIImage APIthat makes working with these variants super easy,whether you want to specify the type up-front,or to generate a variant of an existing image.This is the symbol represented by the "heart" string,and two of its variants, which can now be selected in code.

There are lots of videos about all aspects of SF Symbols in the "Design and buildSF Symbols" collection, and I encourage you to check them all out.

There's more on the UIKit API specifically in "SF Symbols in UIKit and AppKit."UIContentSizeCategory traits represent the system textsize setting, also called the dynamic type size, in code.You can set your labels, textfields, textviews, and image views —perhaps containing SFSymbols — to automatically adjust to the setting.

In iOS 15, we've added a new way to restricthow the traits are applied to view hierarchies.This enables you to easily set a floor or ceiling for the size.This can be a great help when you're making sureyour app's text and images look great at every text size setting.Here, Clock is limiting how small its large time labels get.

Please do not use this API to unduly limit text size.These settings serve an extremely important function,and it's paramount that your app's functionality is all available,and everything is legible, to people using the highest text size setting.So as another example, you might use this to limitthe growth of a headline that's already very large at the default size.

We've unified the system colors across all of our platforms.What does this mean for UIKit?Well, there are some subtle changes to some of the colors,and some colors previously only available in other frameworksare now also available in UIKit wherever your app is running.So if you've been itching to use systemMintor systemBrown in your UIKit app, now is the time.

Also new is UIColor.tintColor.It's a color that's resolved at runtime, based on the appor trait hierarchy's current tint color.It's perfect for using with the new UIButton.Configuration,and the new colorful SF Symbols APIs.

Along with UIColor, there are also enhancementsto the UIColorPicker ViewController,the standard interface for mixing and picking colors.In iOS 14.5, there's a new callback,colorPickerViewController(didSelect:continuously:),that allows app UI to be updated as the color is mixed and changed,as well as when the picking is complete.TextKit 2 is the new, next-generation text layout systemavailable in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and macOS.It's a powerful new system that makes it easierto express what you want to do with text,and it does it in a fast, high performance way.UIKit has adopted it behind the scenes to power UITextField,where it brings better layout to textin languages with complex scripts, like Kannadawith no adoption required.

If you want to know more about TextKit 2, what it can do,and how to use it in your apps, watch "Meet TextKit 2."A UISceneSession represents an instance of your application's UI,and corresponds to an app window represented in the app switcher.Interface state is represented by an NSUserActivity.Your app provides this NSUserActivity to the systemwhen a scene enters the background,and should use it to restore the interface statewhen the scene is reinstantiated.In iPadOS 15, there are a few new APIs to make this easier.There's a new way to get and setthe transient state of our text input views.There's a new UIScene callback that providesa more convenient place to restore state after a storyboard loads.And there's an opportunity to extend the app launch processand delay when your app's UI becomes activeif you have asynchronous model code that returns state.All our engineering efforts are focused on the UIScene-based APIs.If you're still using the old UIApplication-based lifecyclefrom before UIScene was introduced in iPadOS 13,now is the time to switch to UIScene.All UIKit apps can use it. Supporting multiple windows is not required,although, for iPad and Mac apps, it is a great idea.

For a refresher on UIScene, and more details on the enhancedstate restoration APIs, watch "Take your iPad apps to the next level."Speaking of scenes, in UIKit in iOS 15,there are new APIs that allow apps to representthe currently sharable content that's being interacted with in each scene.They're used by the new Siri "Share This" feature on iOS and Mac,and by the NSSharingServicePickerToolbarItemon Mac Catalyst.There are a lot more details in the "Design great actions for Shortcuts,Siri, and Suggestions,"and "Qualities of a great Mac Catalyst app" videos.

For our last API enhancements, we'll return to our dear friends,UICollectionView and UITableView.In iOS 14, we introduced new APIs to allow you to configurethe look and feel of cells much more easily and consistently than in the past.

In iOS 15, new closure-based update handlersmake it easier than ever to reconfigure your cells.

No longer do you need to create a cell subclass and overrideupdateConfiguration using state.You can now write that code inline,in the same place you create the cells.Here, we're greying out our text when the cell is disabled.Similar closure-based functions are available inthe new UIButtonConfiguration APIs too.

We've improved diffable data source to make it easier to updateyour collection and table views.In iOS 15, when you apply a snapshot without animating differences,the UI updates based on those changes without discarding all the existing cells.And there's new API to efficiently reconfigure items,so you can update the content displayed in existing cellswhen the properties of items change without their identity changing.

Every device that UIKit runs on has multiple processor cores,and powerful graphics hardware.Things should happen fast. Animations and scrolling should always be smooth.In iOS 15, there are a few enhancements and new APIsthat make buildings apps with these characteristics even easier.Let's talk about a few of the ones that are available in UIKit.

First, we'll return to UICollectionView and UITableView.iOS 15 introduces changes to cell prefetching.These changes automatically take effect when you build for iOS 15.They can give apps up to twice the amount of time —almost two visual frame's worth —to prepare cells while keeping scrolling perfectly smooth.

Many cells show images.In the past, you might have noticed momentary interruptions in scrollingwhen the main UI queue is tied up decoding large images.

In iOS 15, app code can take more control over this process.There are new easy functions to prepare images so they're completely readywhen your app needs to display them.And these functions are easy to use asynchronously,so the UI queue can be free to process events while the images are being decoded.

Many apps handle large images, but display them at small sizes.To help with this, there are new UIImage APIsthat resize images more efficiently — and save memory —by using the system's knowledge about the images and the display.

For more details of these collection view and image improvements, information abouthow you can take advantage them, and some other great performance tips,check out "Make blazing fast lists and collection views."Swift has introduced new featuresthat make writing asynchronous code easier than ever.Most UIKit APIs must be called on the main UI queue,and we've annotated those APIs as Main Actor to ensurethat this is enforced, for the first time, at compile time.In other areas, like the new UIImage preparation features,we've tweaked our APIs to ensure that UIKit is easy and safe to usewith the new asynchronous Swift language features.Check out "Meet async/await in Swift" and "Meet AsyncSequence"to get going with this new way of developing asynchronous code.

Now, security and privacy.We've built some new technology into iOS 15 that allows the systemto verify what interface is really being interacted with.

We've integrated this into UIKit in a few places,and here, I'm going to talk about three that might affect your app.

First, the Location Button.OS 15 introduces a new APIs allow apps to embed buttons that grant case-by-case,one-time access to the device's current location.They do this when, and only when, they are tapped onwithout lots of alerts or prompts.

The API is flexible, so it can match every app's look,but behind the scenes, it ensures buttons are always clear and legible,or they won't work.There's a whole video discussing how to embed this into any app,"Meet the Location Button"I'm sure you've noticed this banner, introduced in iOS 14.It's shown when an app access data that's been copiedonto the pasteboard in a different app.

In iOS 15, we're eliminating the banner any time the system can confirmthat the data was accessed after deliberate interactionwith a standard system paste interface.For example, a tap on the paste button in the editing menu,or a Cmd-V on a hardware keyboard.

We've also added API to provide few new standard Paste menu items.

When these are used, the notification banner is also not displayed.We provide new ways to specify "Paste," "Paste and Go,""Paste and Search," and "Paste and Match Style."For each of these, there are standard UIResponder selectors —for use with UIMenuController and UICommand —and new identifiers — for use with UIAction.

Sometimes an app wants more informationabout what's on the pasteboard, but doesn't need full access.In iOS 14, we introduced an API that apps can use to check if there is a number,probable web URL, or probable web search term on the pasteboard.And we use these ourselves in Calculator and Safari.

In iOS 15, this API has been greatly expandedto cover all the standard Data Detectors types.None of these will show the notice, because they don't grant accessto the data itself.There are also APIs to retrieve the data values without having to parsethe text yourself, although if these APIs used at any time other than after the useof a standard paste interface, the system will show the paste notice.

Our last privacy enhancement was new in iOS 14.5, and built on an early versionof the technology that powers the location and paste interfaces.UIEventAttribution was developed in conjunction with the WebKit team.WebKit's Private Click Measurement feature provides Web-to-Web Click Measurement.UIEventAttribution brings PCM to UIKit, and provides App-to-Web Click Measurement.This means privacy-preserving measurement of ad clicks and taps.It's easy to use — just cover your ads with UIEventAttributionViews,and pass a UIEventAttribution objectalong with any URLs you open in response to ad taps.

To learn more about this, see the "Meet privacy-preserving ad attribution" video.There's also a great WebKit.org blog post entitled"Introducing Private Click Measurement."Well, that was quite a whirlwind, and we didn't even cover everything that's new.What's next?Please go and compile your app using the iOS 15 SDK.Test out new features like Drag and Drop on iPhone and our enhanced system colors.Adopt the new iOS 15 look with new buttons,bars, lists and symbols.Adopt our new iPad features for better multitasking,keyboard, and trackpad support.And use the new UIKit APIs to respect user privacy,and make even better, even faster apps, even more easily.Thank you.
