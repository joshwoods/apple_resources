Introducing Sign In with Apple

Search this video…Hello. My name is Katherine Nepo.I'm a program managerwith the App Store Trust and Safety team.In this video, my colleague Jeremy Stober and Iwill show you how to safeguard youraccounts, promotions, and content.Today, we will discuss the importance of designingfor trust and safety and present a suite of toolsthat you can use to protect your appsand your customers from attackers.Jeremy will walk you through account risksand promotion abuse.I will close by talking about content risks.The Apple platform is designed to help your businessgrow and thrive with experiences that are trusted, safe,and fair for you and your customers.We're going to review how Sign in with Applebrings the simplicity and securityof two-factor authentication to your app.We will then learn how you can protect promotionsand offers and defend the integrity of yourapp with DeviceCheck and App Attest.Your features are exciting to your customersand may be attractive to attackers.If your app includes the ability to createand manage accounts, supports user-generated content,offers promotional pricing, or includes premium content,it may be a target for fraud and abuse.There are many types of abuse that can happenafter you publish your app.Let's take a closer look at three of them.In many app experiences,accounts are used to protect users' assets.Attackers, eager to gain access, seek new ways to takeover customer accounts and steal their data.If your app offers promotions, you may be targeted byattackers seeking to take advantage of your discountsor otherwise manipulate your app or server.These attackers can be opportunistic individualsor large-scale operations.Attackers can scrape servers for valuable content and steallegitimate apps to modify, repackage, and resell themoutside of the App Store, which can impact your business.I will now turn it over to Jeremy to talk about youraccount risks and how you can protect your users.Thank you, Katherine.I'll begin by talking about account risksthat you should be aware of as an app developer.Many apps and services require customers to create accounts.However, several problems can arisefrom managing customer accounts.For example, there is an incentivefor others to compromise the security of yourcustomers' valuable accounts.Accounts can be taken over through no fault of yours.Your users might be vulnerable to sophisticatedphishing attacks, have their passwords leakedfrom unaffiliated services,or be the victim of misplaced trust.According to the Anti-phishing Working Group,an international consortium,the number of reported phishing attacksobserved by its members doubled over the course of 2020.Since user accounts are valuable,attackers may target them.In addition to account compromises, if you use customerfeedback in your app, for example, to power a ratingsor recommendation system,you may be creating a situationwhere that feedback can be used for illicit gain.This might incentivizethe creation of high volumesof fake accounts that are usedto manipulate these systems.Fake account creations can overload infrastructure,disrupt user experience, and impact the overall authenticityof the app experience you are working hard to craft.There are other forms of abuse that can arisefrom inauthentic account creation.For example, if users can communicate with each other,then there may be an incentive to send unsolicited advertisingover the platform you create using fake accounts.This can adversely impact the customer experienceand your reputation.Apple offers a few tools that developers can useto better manage account risks.One method to avoid a number of issues with accountmanagement is to adopt Sign in with Apple.Integrating with Sign in with Apple willallow you to benefit from Apple's robustand ongoing efforts to keep customer accounts secure.Sign in with Apple is protected by Apple'stwo-factor authentication.Customers on Apple devices can sign inand re-authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID any time.The benefits to integrating with Sign in with Appleare not limited to security.The credential return on first authorization includesa flag that indicates with a high degree confidencethat a user is real and not a bot.This flag can be checked on the client.If a flag indicates a user is likely real,no additional challenge is needed.However, if the platform is unsupported,or the value returned is unknown, a challengeto the user is recommended to prevent scripted traffic.To provide this flag, Apple uses a private, secure,on-device machine learning model in combination withservice side inferences based on account activity.With Sign in with Apple, you can take advantageof Apple's world-class securityand industry-leading antifraud protections.If you are not using Sign in with Apple,there are a number of toolsthat you can use to improveaccount security and preventinauthentic account creations.There are several videos describing waysto encourage strong and unique passwordswithout increasing user friction.Watch "One tap account security upgrades"and "Autofill everywhere"for more information.For inauthentic account creation, prevention meansmaking risk-based decisions using the datayou are able to collect from the account creation requestlike email domain and other account detailsthat may be part of your sign-up flow.As part of your strategy, you may want to limit the numberof account creations that can happen on a single Apple device.Limiting account creation on physical deviceswill make it more difficultto create large numbers of fake accounts.Apple offers an API called DeviceCheckthat can help with this.Using this API, you can effectivelylimit account creations on authentic Apple devices.You may be promoting your business with freeor discounted items in your app.Next, I'll talk about an example of how this can be abused.Suppose you want to offer an in-app promotionto grow your business.Depending on the type of app, this could be anythingfrom a free sandwich to a discounted trial.You may find, however, that uptake of the special offercomes at a cost, as some people abuse the promotionby re-downloading the app multiple times.Using the DeviceCheck API, you canlimit the number of promotion redemptions per devicewhile protecting user privacy.The service allows you to set two bits of informationon each device in a way that's strongly tiedto device authenticity and that can be read backeven after a complete reset of the device.At a high level, the use of DeviceCheck will allow youto verify that the device is real and allow you to querypreviously set values of the two permitted bits.You have the ability to set and change the bitsas you please.In the case of a free promotion, you can use the valueof the return bits to determine if the devicehas been used to redeem the promotion in the past.You can also choose to set the bits per deviceon account creation instead,which would offer a robust new signaltied to verified hardware that you can usein rate limiting account creation in your app.After a period of time, you can choose to reset the bits.This will facilitate reuse of the promotionon a time period that you control and could helpmanage situations where devices change hands.More details are available in the videos"Privacy and your apps"as well as the video “Mitigate fraudwith App Attest and DeviceCheck.”Katherine will now talk aboutways to protect your contentand APIs from inauthentic clients.Thank you, Jeremy.Let's walk through some of the riskspotentially posed to your content.Your content is valuableand may be an attractive target for attackers.An attacker can develop and distributeunauthorized software that allows unpermitted accessto your app's premium content.This illicit access may negatively impact your earningsand create opportunities for cheating and deception.Such abuses may undermine the trust of your usersand ultimately harm your business.To help you protect the integrityof your app experiences, we created App Attest,which provides app protectionstarting with iOS 14 and tvOS 15.App Attest enables you to verifythat the apps connecting to your serversare the apps that you published on the App Store,unmodified and running on genuine Apple devices.Leveraging Apple's secure enclave processor,iOS and tvOS generate a cryptographic attestationof your app's identity which you can send to your serverfor verification before making your critical assets available.App Attest is easy to use.With only a few exchanges between your app and your serveryou can verify the identityof the app requesting your content.For more information on App Attest,including how your servercan perform verification,please check out the"Mitigate fraud with App Attest and DeviceCheck"technical video.The tools we discussed today will enable youto guard your apps, your users, and your content.Implement Sign in with Apple to secure your accounts fromattackers and prevent access to your valuable data.Use DeviceCheck to prevent abuse of your promotional offerings.And protect your contentwith App Attest by validatingthe authenticity of the appsconnecting to your serverbefore serving their requests.Thank you for watching.We look forward to seeing your businesses growand thrive in a fair, safe, and trusted environment.[percussive music]
