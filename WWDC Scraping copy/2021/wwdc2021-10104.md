Meet Safari Web Extensions

Search this video…♪ ♪Hi.Welcome to Meet Safari Web Extensions on iOS.I'm David Quesada, an engineer on the Safari team.And today, I'll be walking through an exciting new featurein iOS 15, Safari Web Extensions.Web Extensions are a powerful typeof browser extension that allows users to extendand customize their browsing in a huge number of ways.They're built with the standard web technologies:HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.And the WebExtension API has been availablefor all the major desktop browsers for a while, which means you can writea browser extension once and deploy itacross all those browsers, reaching so many users.But now, I'm thrilled to tell you that Web Extensionsare coming to iOS 15, letting you builda browser extension for more users than ever.I'd love to show you a demo now of a Safari Web Extensionrunning on iOS.I'll be showing off an extension called Sea Creator.This extension was originally written for browsers on the Mac,but I've been working on bringing it to iOS.This extension shows me fun facts about sea creaturesand makes reading more about sea life funby replacing the names of sea creatures with emoji.Let's take a look at this on an iPad.Now, I've just installed Sea Creator, and I've opened up Safari,where I'm reading an article about fish.I'd really love to start using Sea Creator hereso I can liven up this page with some emoji.So I'll open up the action menuand drill into the new Extensions list,which shows me all the extensionsthat I have available, including Sea Creator.So I'll turn it on.Now, another feature of Sea Creator is thatI can put it front and center in Safariwith a custom Start Pagethat I use every time I open a new tab.I'll check that out in a bit.And now that I've turned on Sea Creator,it's right there in the Action menuready for me to use.And when I do that, Safari asks me if I'm OKwith giving Sea Creator full access to this site.We brought the same Web Extensions permission modelfrom Safari on the Mac to iOS, which means I, as the user,have full control over how much of my browsing extensions can access.I'll talk in more detail about this later.But right now, I'll allow Sea Creator to run.And just like that,it swapped in all these fish emoji on the page,which is just how I like to read it.It's also opened this popup showing me a running totalof just how many words I've replaced so far.But it's not just this one page.I gave Sea Creator permission to workacross this website as a whole.So as I navigate to other pages,Sea Creator is still working for meand gives me emoji here as well.I don't need to go out of my way to open the extension againonce I've started using it.Of course, Sea Creator has one more feature that I mentioned earlier.When I open up a new tab to do some more browsing,I'm greeted by this bold New Tab pagefrom Sea Creator with a fact of the daytoday about starfish--and once again, that counter showing mejust how many emoji Sea Creator has given me so far.This is pretty cool.So that was a quick look at Sea Creatorworking great on iOS.In this session, I want to show howyou too can create a Safari Web Extension for iOS.And I'll be using Sea Creator as an exampleof how I took an existing extensionand brought it to iOS with just a few changes.But don't worry if you've never written a browser extension before.I'll give you an overview of how Web Extensions workand how you can get started creating a new one.Along the way, I'll cover some debugging techniquesand best practicesto help your extension be the best it can be.And I'll wrap it up with some thoughts on user privacyand how it relates to the permissions modelof Safari Web Extensions.So, our journey begins with creating a web extensionthat can run on iOS in the first place.Let's look behind the scenes to understand how this works.It's important to understand that for Safari,Web Extensions are parts of apps.So when you want to install a web extension,you install its app.And like any other type of iOS app,apps with Safari Web Extensionscan be found on the App Store.And Xcode has everything you needto build an app to ship your extension.So when you think about building a Safari Web Extension for iOS,you may be starting from one of three places.Maybe you're looking at creating a new extension from scratch,or maybe you already wrote one for another browser,and you want to bring it to Safari,or perhaps you already have an extension for Safarion the Mac, and you want to make it available on iOS too.I want to go over what you can do in each of these cases.So first, if you want to create a brand-new Web Extension,you can use Xcode's included templates,which make it super easy to get started.You can create a new Xcode projectand use the Safari Extension App templateto start building a web extensionas well as its containing app.And when you use this template,you get an extension that comes completewith all the resources a typical web extension might have.You can use this as a starting pointby customizing what's already thereor adding or removing piecesaccording to what your extension needs.Now, if you've already built a Web Extensionfor another browser,you can take advantage of a toolcalled the Safari Web Extension Converterto automatically create an Xcode projectfrom that existing extension.You simply run the converter on the command line,provide it a path to your extension's resources,and it will create a new Xcode projectthat packages your extension in a native app.And new in Xcode 13,the Safari Web Extension Converter creates a projectthat supports Safari on both iOSand macOS by default.And the newly created project, by default,references your existing extension's resourcesat the original path rather than copying them.Finally, if you've already set up an Xcode projectin the past to build a Safari Web Extension for macOS,you can also use the converterto upgrade that project so it supports iOS too.You can run the converterand provide a --rebuild-project optionalong with a path to your Xcode project.Then the converter will add an iOS-compatible versionof the extension and a containing app to your project.Now I want to show the Safari Web Extension Converterin action by retracing my stepsof bringing Sea Creator to iOS for the very first time.So here is my Sea Creator Xcode project,which I used to develop Sea Creatorfor Safari on the Mac.But it only supports the Mac right now,and I want to fix that.So I'll open up a terminaland type xcrun safari-web-extension-converter,and I'll use the --rebuild-project option,and I'll provide a path to my Xcode projectand run the converter.And it confirms some details about my existing projectand stops to ask me if I'd like to overwrite itwith a cross-platform version.Also, any time you run the converter,it'll warn you about potential compatibility issues with your extension.In this case, it's warning me about the useof something called a persistent background page,which isn't supported on iOS.I'll need to fix this later.But for now, I'll let the converter keep going.And when it's done, my project automatically opens.Notice there are folders herefor both the iOS and macOS versionsof my app and the extension.Now, I want to take a look at the Resources folderwithin the Shared extension group.Here is where I'll find the core piecesof the Sea Creator Web Extension.For those of you who are new to the Web Extension API,I want to explain what some of these pieces are,since I'll be referring to them later.I'll start with the manifest.This is a JSON filethat describes the structure of the extension.It includes important informationsuch as the extension's name,which websites it wants to access,and what features it supports,such as a pop-up page or a New Tab pagelike Sea Creator has.Next, there's a JavaScript source called the background script.The browser can run this script in the backgroundwhen your extension is enabled, and it allows your extensionto listen for various events coming from the browseror other parts of your extension.Sea Creator's background script keeps track of that counterof just how many emoji it's added to web pages.Next, there's another type of scriptcalled the content script.The browser automatically runs this scripton web pages that the user visits.An extension can have any number of content scripts,and the manifest specifies which content scriptsshould run on which websites.This script gives your extension the power to extendand customize pages by directly manipulating them.For example, Sea Creator's content page is what actually doesthe replacement of animal names with emoji.And after it does that,it sends a message to the background scriptso it can update that central counter.Of course, the extension also has some HTML,CSS, and other JavaScript filesfor the New Tab page, and that pop-up page as well.And finally, there are some other resources heresuch as localized strings,as well as the extension's icons and other graphics.So all of these pieces come togetherto make the Sea Creator Web Extension.And thanks to the Safari Web Extension Converter,I now have a project that packages allof this up into a native app.And I can run my project now,so I can start using Sea Creator in Safari right away.I'll do that now by going to the toolbarat the top of the screen, selecting Sea Creator for iOS,and choosing the destination where I want to run the app.I don't have any iOS devices connected,so in this case, I'll use an iPhone simulator.I'll then click the Run button.And Xcode will then build my app project,load the simulator, and run my app.So this is the Sea Creator appgenerated by the Web Extension Converter,and it contains the Sea Creator Web Extension.At the beginning of this session,I showed that I can turn on extensionsdirectly within Safari,but as the app suggests,I can also use Settings to manage my extensions.And I want to show that off here,so I'll switch to Settings.I'll jump into Safari,Extensions,and then Sea Creator.And here's the details page for Sea Creator with some infoabout the extension and a switch to turn it on.But that switch is grayed out,and I can't turn on the extension yet.This means there's a problemwith the extension that keeps it from loading.I definitely need to look into this next.And this is where I want to talk about debugging.It's a great first step to just be ableto build your project and install your extension,but of course, it's essential to know howto dig deeper to find out why things go wrong if they do.It's easy to identify errors in web extensions and use toolssuch as Web Inspector to debug parts of your extension,and that's what I'll show you now.Looking back at Settings, there's an error hereat the bottom telling me that Extensions on iOSmust have a non-persistent background page.This sounds familiar.It's the same issue the converter warned me about earlier.And now I want to actually go fix it.So I'll go back to Xcode,open up the manifest,and add a "persistent": false keyin the background section.I'll talk about this change in more detail later,but for now, this should get me past the error.Now that I've made this change, I'll run the app againto install the updated extension on the simulator.And here's the Sea Creator app once again.It looked like I only had that one error to fix,so now I'll go straight to Safariinstead of going back to Settings.I'll open up Safari,open the Extensions list,and there's Sea Creator,and it looks like I can turn it on now.Safari offers me the choiceto use Sea Creator's New Tab experience.And I do want to check out what that looks likeon iPhone since I haven't seen it before.So I'll set that as my New Tab page,close out the Extensions list,and open up a new tab.And just as I'd expect,there's that New Tab page from Sea Creator.But the text is really small,and the page just doesn't look good.This is the first time I've ever run this extension on iOS,so it's not surprising that the content hasn't yetbeen adjusted to work well with iPhone.I want to go fix this now, and to do that,I'll use Web Inspector to take a closer look at this pageand try out a few changes I have in mind.So to get to Web Inspector,I'll open up Safari on my Mac,and then I'll double-check in Safari's Advanced Preferencesto make sure I have the Develop menu enabled.And now that I have that Develop menu,I can open it up, select the iPhone SimulatorI've been using, and choose a page to inspect.Now, there are two options here for Sea Creator.I could select the Extension Background Pageif I'd like to debug the background script,but in this case, I want to inspect the New Tab page.So I'll choose the other option.And now I'm in Web Inspector.The first thing I want to address hereis the overall size of the page.By default, Safari on iPhone renders the web pageas if it were the size of a desktop browser,and then it scales that larger content downso it all fits on screen.But I don't want this behavior heresince it makes the text too small.So I'll use a very common practicewhen it comes to web design for iPhone.I'll add a viewport meta-tag to tell Safarinot to scale the content this way.I'll select the Head element,add a Child element,and add the contentsof that viewport meta-tag.I'll add the tag, and the page updates livein the simulator in response to that change.Now all the text is at a readable size,but it doesn't all fit on screen,which is my next problem.I want to inspect the elements on this pageto understand why it lays out like this.I'll look at the body tag,and I notice there's this div herethat contains all the content on the page.If I focus itand look in the stylesheet sidebar to the right,I notice that the elementhas a fixed width of 850.That would make sense on a desktop,where windows can be really wideand you'd want the text to wrap at some point.But that doesn't work on iPhonebecause the phone just isn't that wide.I think it would make more sense hereif that rule set a maximum width for the contentrather than demanding an exact width.And I can simply edit the rule here.I'll click widthand change it to max-width,and the page in the simulator updatesto reflect that change.Now the content's width is much more appropriate for iPhone,and all of the text fits on screen.This looks much better now, but these changes that I've madeare only temporary to this Inspector session.I want to actually save these changes backinto my project so I don't lose them.And it's really easy to save an updated copyof the stylesheet while I work in the stylesheet Inspector.I can simply type Command+Sto save my stylesheet that has that updated rule.And I'll overwrite the new_tab_page.cssin my project.But for the viewport change, I added that tagto a live web page rather than a static resource,so I'll have to make the same change to the original source.I'll select that tag,copy it,go back to Xcode,open up that source for the New Tab page,and paste the contents there.So the next time I run Sea Creator,it'll use that updated page source and stylesheet,and it'll look just as good again.And that's been a few examples of using Web Inspectorto look under the hood of a web extension,understand exactly what's happening,and experiment with potential changeswhile iterating on the extension.For now, I'm only going to look at the New Tab page,but later on in development, I should obviously go testall the other parts of the extension on iOS,and I'd use the same tools and techniques for that.You can use Safari's extension settings on iOSto view any errors in the configurationof your Web Extension.Specifically, Sea Creator had the fatal errorof using a persistent background page,but there may also be non-fatal warnings herethat you should check out.These details will only appear in Settingsfor debug builds of your app from Xcodeand not for copies from the App Store or TestFlight.As you make changes to your web extension,you simply run your app again to update the extensionon the device or simulator.And of course, Web Inspector allows youto investigate issues with your extension's web content.Remember that in order to access Web Inspector,I had to enable the Develop menuin Safari's Advanced Preferences on the Mac.In my demo, I used the iOS simulator for my extension,but if you wanted to use a physical iOS device,you would also need to enable Web Inspector supporton that device in Safari's Advanced Settings.To take a deeper dive into Web Inspectorand learn about some of its newest features,check out Discover Web Inspector improvements.Now that I've created a Safari Web Extension for iOSand I've debugged a few basic issues,I'd like to walk through some best practices to keep in mind,including some things you might need to watch out foras you build an extension for Safari on iOS.I'll focus on five topicsthat may be relevant to your extension,starting with non-persistent background pages.The background page is a web page that the browser loadsto run your extension's background script.And this page allows your extension to handle eventssent by the browser or other parts of your extension.But keeping this page loaded has a performance cost.It can use memory and poweras if you were keeping one more tab open and runningfor every enabled extension.Keeping all these pages loaded all the timecan be pretty wasteful.But you can make a background page non-persistent,which means the browser will only load it when your extensionactually needs to do work, and the browser can laterunload that page when it's been idle for some time.That way, the performance cost is only paidwhile your extension is doing something useful.This is important because background pages must benon-persistent on iOS, where system memoryand battery life are especially at a premium.The web extension templates in Xcode already comewith a non-persistent background page,so they're ready to run on iOS.But if you have an existing extensionthat uses a persistent background pagelike Sea Creator did,you'll need to change it to be non-persistent.And you can do that by adding that "persistent:" False keyin the background section of your manifest.To learn more about some best practicesand potential issues you may facewhen updating an extensionto use a non-persistent background page,check outExplore Safari Web Extension Improvements.Up next,let's talk about responsive design.As we learned with Sea Creator,bringing an extension to iOSmeans its web content may be renderedin new environments that you haven't considered before.Just like I did with Sea Creator's New Tab page,be sure to test the layout of your extension's web contenton iPhone and iPad and use a responsive designthat can accommodate various screen sizes.But the difference in screen size isn'tthe only consideration when it comesto making your web content look great on iOS.Let me tell you about a few things you should be aware of.If your extension has full-page web contentthat lays out important elements near the bottom of the screen,you may find it being covered by Safari's Tab Baror the device's home indicator.In CSS terminology, this area near the edgeof the screen where content may be partially hiddenis called the unsafe area,while the usable areaof the viewport is called the safe area.By using CSS environment variables,you can calculate the safe area insetto make sure important elements are positionedwithin the safe area.On iPhone, this is also worth considering in Landscape,where devices may have safe area insetson the left and right side of the display as well.By using similar CSSand by specifying the viewport-fit parameterin your viewport,you can give your web content an edge-to-edge designthat still keeps important content within the safe area.Check out Design for Safari 15 to learn more about these APIsthat can make your web content feel more at home on iOS.On iPad and desktop browsers,if your extension has a pop-up page,you may be used to it being shown as a popoverthat's comfortably sized to fit its content.But on iPhone, however,Safari will display this web page as a sheet,which may be a surprise to your content.The sheet spans the full width of the device,and it may be laid out tallerthan the content expects.In this screenshot of an early version of Sea Creator,the content didn't have much paddingfrom the edge of the screen,and we set a background color on an individual elementin the page rather than on the body.So the text looks a bit crampedand the background doesn't fillthe whole page.But we've since updated the alignmentand padding of the contentto give it a little more space to breathe,and we now specify a background coloron the body so it covers the whole sheet.If your extension has a pop-up page,think about whether you should make similar changesfor your extension.And note that Safari will use a similar presentationin Landscape as well.Be sure to test your extension's interfacein these configurations to make sure its layout makes sensewhen given this extra space.And finally among the design considerations,I want to mention Dynamic Type.Dynamic Type is a feature that allows usersto adjust the size of text and other visual elements.You can make content smaller to fit moreor larger so it's more visible.Be sure to test your extension's interfaceunder smaller or larger text sizes to make sure it looks all rightwith any size the user chooses.To help your web content make the most of Dynamic Type,WebKit has a variety of system fontsthat respect the user's text size preferenceand resize to match.You should adopt these fonts in your extensionso that its text remains comfortably readable to the user,just like the rest of Safari's interface.So the main takeaway here isto design your extension's web contentwith Safari's UI in mind.Test any full page web content on iPhoneto make sure that it adapts well to the screen sizeand doesn't clash with Safari's UIat the bottom of the screen.You should test your pop-up web page on iPhone to make sureits layout makes sense with the sheet-style presentation,and you should test your interfaceacross a wide range of Dynamic Type sizesto make sure it adjusts for the user's preference.For more tips on designing web content to look greatin Safari's new interface,check out Design for Safari 15.Up next, pointer events.If your extension currently depends on handling mouse eventsfor arbitrary clicks and drags,be aware that the same eventswon't be sent when the user taps on iOS.You should instead adopt the Pointer Events API.It's similar to the Mouse Events API,and it works just the same with mouse input,but the Pointer Events API also reports touchesand Apple Pencil input.And now let's talkabout the Web Extension Windows API.On desktop browsers,users may have multiple windows openand your Web Extension can use the browser.windows APIto work with these windows.And the same is true on iPad,where you can also open multiple windows of Safari.Each Safari window might be full screen,or it might be in split view,side-by-side with another app,maybe another Safari.Under the hood though,each of these windows is actuallycalled a scene on iOS.If your extension uses the Windows API,you should know that each sceneof Safari actually has two windows:one for regular browsing and one for Private browsing.This is also true on iPhone,even though there's only one scene of Safari.If I call the browser.windows.getAll APIto query what windows are open,then the API returnsthese two window objects.In the first window,the incognito property is false,and focused is true.This represents the window I'm looking at,which is in regular browsingand not Private Browsing.The second window holds the Private Browsing tabsin the Safari scene.And of course, its properties are different from the first window.Incognito is true, and focused is false.Now when I switch Safari to Private Browsingand call windows.getAll again,the API returns different window objects.Now the focused property has changed in both windows,and the second window now has focus.This works exactly the same on iPadwhere one Safari sceneis represented by two windows.But if I open a second scene of Safari in split view,the API would now report four windows.And if my extension listens for the windows.onCreated event,it would observe that event fire twicewhen opening split view,once for each of the two new windowsin the new Safari scene.So if you use this API, keep this model in mindas you encounter extra windowsyou might not expect at first.In addition to this model of what a window actually is,there are a few limitations of the windows APIthat may affect your extension.The methods to create, remove,and update the state of windows aren't available.On iOS, window placementis fully controlled by the user,not any app or extension.The windows.onRemoved event won't be firedas you'd maybe expect when the user closes Safarifrom the app switcher.That doesn't truly close or remove a window.It just leaves it for the user to pick upwhere they left off later.And note that these restrictions only applyto the windows themselvesand not the tabs within those windows.With the browser.tabs API,Web Extensions still have full control to add,remove, and update individual tabs as they'd like.Now, last up in the best practicesis feature detection.When bringing an existing extension to iOS,you may find some APIs are unavailable--for example, the windows APIs that I mentioned a moment ago.But there are a few others, like context menusand WebRequest.If non-essential parts of your extension use such APIs,be sure to use feature detection to handle the casethat they're not available.So, instead of unconditionallycalling these APIs,conditionalize that code basedon the existence of those APIs,so you can cleanly exclude parts of your extensionand make it more flexible when it comesto which browsers it supports.You should also use this pattern when adopting new APIsthat are added in the future,as they might not immediately be availableacross all browsers or in previous versionsof browsers that some users may still be using.And that wraps up the best practices.I've now covered many parts of Safari Web Extensions,but I've saved arguably the most important topic for last,and that's user privacy.User privacy is a huge part of everything we do,so we believe users deserve transparency and controlwhen it comes to how their personal data is handled.And of course that includes everything they do in Safari.Web Extensions can gain a tremendous amountof access to the user's browsing,so the decision of whether that should be allowedand on which websites should be up to the user.Historically, other browsers would give an extensionfull access to every website it requestsright away when you turn it on,which is potentially asking you to sacrifice privacy up frontjust to get a taste of the extension.But Safari aims to do better by providing transparencyand control to Web Extension userswith an opt-in model where extensions are only given accessto websites when the user consents.You caught a glimpse of this earlier with Sea Creator.It didn't immediately start modifying my pageswhen I turned it on, but it was only able to do thatwhen I explicitly told Safari,"Yes, I want to use this extension here,and I'm okay with it having access."And once I give an extension that access,Safari tells me in the Tab Barthat I have an extension running on this page,so I know that the extensionmight be seeing my web browsing here.But if I navigate to any websitethat I haven't yet allowed the extension to access,that indicator disappears.And I know that that extension isn't running on this pageand can't see what I'm doing here.Let's look at this permissions model in more detail.Again, users opt in to your extensionwhen they choose to use it on specific websites.Safari will ask the user for consentby presenting a dialog which makes it clearwhich websites the extension is trying to access.This happens when the user invokes your extensionby selecting it in the Action menuor by using any of its keyboard shortcuts.And this consent is requiredfor any privacy sensitive API to work.Specifically,any API that reveals the URLor title of a tab will only include this infoif your extension has permission for that URL.The Cookies API will only let your extensionread and write cookies for websitesyour extension has permission for.And injecting JavaScript and stylesheets willonly be allowed on websites where,you guessed it, your extension has permission.If your extension's scripts call any of these APIswhen your extension doesn't have the required permissionsbut hasn't asked the user yet,Safari will wait to call your completion handlersand will show a non-disruptive bannerat the top of the screen.This lets the user know that your extensionwants some more access, and they can then review the setof websites your extension is asking for,and they can make a decision to allowor reject access for those websites.You should avoid requesting more permission this waythan your extension really needs.For some types of extensions,this way of thinking about permissionmight be a bit more than you need.For example, extensions that share or annotateindividual web pages don't need full access to the siteany time the user visits in any tab,but rather they just want permission onceto do one thing at a time for the user.And there's a great solution for those extensionscalled the activeTab permission.When your extension requests the activeTab permission,Safari will automatically grant your extension permissionon tabs where the userexplicitly uses your extension.And this permission will be limitedto just the current website in just the current tab.So it'll be revoked if the user navigates that tabto a different website.Safari won't display a prompt when granting this permission,since there's no long-term commitment needed from the user.To adopt this feature, simply add activeTabto the Permissions section of your manifest.So all of this is to say that in Safari,users are always in controlof which websites their extensions can work on.So be aware that your extension won't automatically be ableto go to work on every page the user visits.For many extensions, the activeTab permissionis a great way to get access to just the pageswhere the user is using your extensionwithout bugging themabout any access beyond that.All of these concepts are the sameacross all our platforms that support Safari Web Extensions.To see this in action on macOS and get a closer lookat updating an extension to use activeTab, check outMeet Safari Web Extensions from WWDC 2020.And that's the privacy preserving permissions modelof Safari Web Extensions.Along with everything else I've covered today,I hope this gives you a more complete viewof Safari Web Extensions on iOS and the tools availableto you for building them.We're so excited to see the Web Extension experiencesthat will be brought to Safari on iOS 15,including the many extensions we already love on the Mac todaybut also the great new extensionsthat are yet to come.So if you're new to extension development,I encourage you to check out the linked resourcesassociated with this session.There, you'll find sample code that you can downloadand try out for yourself.And you can read more about the Web Extension APIsavailable to you in Apple's developer documentationand the MDN Web Docs.If you already develop a Web Extensionfor another browser or for Safari on the Mac,I encourage you to try out

♪ ♪Hi.Welcome to Meet Safari Web Extensions on iOS.I'm David Quesada, an engineer on the Safari team.And today, I'll be walking through an exciting new featurein iOS 15, Safari Web Extensions.Web Extensions are a powerful typeof browser extension that allows users to extendand customize their browsing in a huge number of ways.They're built with the standard web technologies:HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.And the WebExtension API has been availablefor all the major desktop browsers for a while, which means you can writea browser extension once and deploy itacross all those browsers, reaching so many users.But now, I'm thrilled to tell you that Web Extensionsare coming to iOS 15, letting you builda browser extension for more users than ever.I'd love to show you a demo now of a Safari Web Extensionrunning on iOS.I'll be showing off an extension called Sea Creator.This extension was originally written for browsers on the Mac,but I've been working on bringing it to iOS.This extension shows me fun facts about sea creaturesand makes reading more about sea life funby replacing the names of sea creatures with emoji.Let's take a look at this on an iPad.Now, I've just installed Sea Creator, and I've opened up Safari,where I'm reading an article about fish.I'd really love to start using Sea Creator hereso I can liven up this page with some emoji.So I'll open up the action menuand drill into the new Extensions list,which shows me all the extensionsthat I have available, including Sea Creator.So I'll turn it on.Now, another feature of Sea Creator is thatI can put it front and center in Safariwith a custom Start Pagethat I use every time I open a new tab.I'll check that out in a bit.And now that I've turned on Sea Creator,it's right there in the Action menuready for me to use.And when I do that, Safari asks me if I'm OKwith giving Sea Creator full access to this site.We brought the same Web Extensions permission modelfrom Safari on the Mac to iOS, which means I, as the user,have full control over how much of my browsing extensions can access.I'll talk in more detail about this later.But right now, I'll allow Sea Creator to run.And just like that,it swapped in all these fish emoji on the page,which is just how I like to read it.It's also opened this popup showing me a running totalof just how many words I've replaced so far.But it's not just this one page.I gave Sea Creator permission to workacross this website as a whole.So as I navigate to other pages,Sea Creator is still working for meand gives me emoji here as well.I don't need to go out of my way to open the extension againonce I've started using it.Of course, Sea Creator has one more feature that I mentioned earlier.When I open up a new tab to do some more browsing,I'm greeted by this bold New Tab pagefrom Sea Creator with a fact of the daytoday about starfish--and once again, that counter showing mejust how many emoji Sea Creator has given me so far.This is pretty cool.So that was a quick look at Sea Creatorworking great on iOS.In this session, I want to show howyou too can create a Safari Web Extension for iOS.And I'll be using Sea Creator as an exampleof how I took an existing extensionand brought it to iOS with just a few changes.But don't worry if you've never written a browser extension before.I'll give you an overview of how Web Extensions workand how you can get started creating a new one.Along the way, I'll cover some debugging techniquesand best practicesto help your extension be the best it can be.And I'll wrap it up with some thoughts on user privacyand how it relates to the permissions modelof Safari Web Extensions.So, our journey begins with creating a web extensionthat can run on iOS in the first place.Let's look behind the scenes to understand how this works.It's important to understand that for Safari,Web Extensions are parts of apps.So when you want to install a web extension,you install its app.And like any other type of iOS app,apps with Safari Web Extensionscan be found on the App Store.And Xcode has everything you needto build an app to ship your extension.So when you think about building a Safari Web Extension for iOS,you may be starting from one of three places.Maybe you're looking at creating a new extension from scratch,or maybe you already wrote one for another browser,and you want to bring it to Safari,or perhaps you already have an extension for Safarion the Mac, and you want to make it available on iOS too.I want to go over what you can do in each of these cases.So first, if you want to create a brand-new Web Extension,you can use Xcode's included templates,which make it super easy to get started.You can create a new Xcode projectand use the Safari Extension App templateto start building a web extensionas well as its containing app.And when you use this template,you get an extension that comes completewith all the resources a typical web extension might have.You can use this as a starting pointby customizing what's already thereor adding or removing piecesaccording to what your extension needs.Now, if you've already built a Web Extensionfor another browser,you can take advantage of a toolcalled the Safari Web Extension Converterto automatically create an Xcode projectfrom that existing extension.You simply run the converter on the command line,provide it a path to your extension's resources,and it will create a new Xcode projectthat packages your extension in a native app.And new in Xcode 13,the Safari Web Extension Converter creates a projectthat supports Safari on both iOSand macOS by default.And the newly created project, by default,references your existing extension's resourcesat the original path rather than copying them.Finally, if you've already set up an Xcode projectin the past to build a Safari Web Extension for macOS,you can also use the converterto upgrade that project so it supports iOS too.You can run the converterand provide a --rebuild-project optionalong with a path to your Xcode project.Then the converter will add an iOS-compatible versionof the extension and a containing app to your project.Now I want to show the Safari Web Extension Converterin action by retracing my stepsof bringing Sea Creator to iOS for the very first time.

So here is my Sea Creator Xcode project,which I used to develop Sea Creatorfor Safari on the Mac.But it only supports the Mac right now,and I want to fix that.So I'll open up a terminaland type xcrun safari-web-extension-converter,and I'll use the --rebuild-project option,and I'll provide a path to my Xcode projectand run the converter.And it confirms some details about my existing projectand stops to ask me if I'd like to overwrite itwith a cross-platform version.Also, any time you run the converter,it'll warn you about potential compatibility issues with your extension.In this case, it's warning me about the useof something called a persistent background page,which isn't supported on iOS.I'll need to fix this later.But for now, I'll let the converter keep going.

And when it's done, my project automatically opens.Notice there are folders herefor both the iOS and macOS versionsof my app and the extension.Now, I want to take a look at the Resources folderwithin the Shared extension group.Here is where I'll find the core piecesof the Sea Creator Web Extension.For those of you who are new to the Web Extension API,I want to explain what some of these pieces are,since I'll be referring to them later.I'll start with the manifest.This is a JSON filethat describes the structure of the extension.It includes important informationsuch as the extension's name,which websites it wants to access,and what features it supports,such as a pop-up page or a New Tab pagelike Sea Creator has.Next, there's a JavaScript source called the background script.The browser can run this script in the backgroundwhen your extension is enabled, and it allows your extensionto listen for various events coming from the browseror other parts of your extension.Sea Creator's background script keeps track of that counterof just how many emoji it's added to web pages.Next, there's another type of scriptcalled the content script.The browser automatically runs this scripton web pages that the user visits.An extension can have any number of content scripts,and the manifest specifies which content scriptsshould run on which websites.This script gives your extension the power to extendand customize pages by directly manipulating them.For example, Sea Creator's content page is what actually doesthe replacement of animal names with emoji.And after it does that,it sends a message to the background scriptso it can update that central counter.Of course, the extension also has some HTML,CSS, and other JavaScript filesfor the New Tab page, and that pop-up page as well.And finally, there are some other resources heresuch as localized strings,as well as the extension's icons and other graphics.So all of these pieces come togetherto make the Sea Creator Web Extension.And thanks to the Safari Web Extension Converter,I now have a project that packages allof this up into a native app.And I can run my project now,so I can start using Sea Creator in Safari right away.I'll do that now by going to the toolbarat the top of the screen, selecting Sea Creator for iOS,and choosing the destination where I want to run the app.I don't have any iOS devices connected,so in this case, I'll use an iPhone simulator.

I'll then click the Run button.And Xcode will then build my app project,load the simulator, and run my app.

So this is the Sea Creator appgenerated by the Web Extension Converter,and it contains the Sea Creator Web Extension.At the beginning of this session,I showed that I can turn on extensionsdirectly within Safari,but as the app suggests,I can also use Settings to manage my extensions.And I want to show that off here,so I'll switch to Settings.

I'll jump into Safari,Extensions,and then Sea Creator.And here's the details page for Sea Creator with some infoabout the extension and a switch to turn it on.But that switch is grayed out,and I can't turn on the extension yet.This means there's a problemwith the extension that keeps it from loading.I definitely need to look into this next.And this is where I want to talk about debugging.It's a great first step to just be ableto build your project and install your extension,but of course, it's essential to know howto dig deeper to find out why things go wrong if they do.It's easy to identify errors in web extensions and use toolssuch as Web Inspector to debug parts of your extension,and that's what I'll show you now.Looking back at Settings, there's an error hereat the bottom telling me that Extensions on iOSmust have a non-persistent background page.This sounds familiar.It's the same issue the converter warned me about earlier.And now I want to actually go fix it.So I'll go back to Xcode,open up the manifest,and add a "persistent": false keyin the background section.I'll talk about this change in more detail later,but for now, this should get me past the error.Now that I've made this change, I'll run the app againto install the updated extension on the simulator.

And here's the Sea Creator app once again.It looked like I only had that one error to fix,so now I'll go straight to Safariinstead of going back to Settings.

I'll open up Safari,open the Extensions list,and there's Sea Creator,and it looks like I can turn it on now.Safari offers me the choiceto use Sea Creator's New Tab experience.And I do want to check out what that looks likeon iPhone since I haven't seen it before.So I'll set that as my New Tab page,close out the Extensions list,and open up a new tab.And just as I'd expect,there's that New Tab page from Sea Creator.But the text is really small,and the page just doesn't look good.This is the first time I've ever run this extension on iOS,so it's not surprising that the content hasn't yetbeen adjusted to work well with iPhone.I want to go fix this now, and to do that,I'll use Web Inspector to take a closer look at this pageand try out a few changes I have in mind.So to get to Web Inspector,I'll open up Safari on my Mac,and then I'll double-check in Safari's Advanced Preferencesto make sure I have the Develop menu enabled.

And now that I have that Develop menu,I can open it up, select the iPhone SimulatorI've been using, and choose a page to inspect.Now, there are two options here for Sea Creator.I could select the Extension Background Pageif I'd like to debug the background script,but in this case, I want to inspect the New Tab page.So I'll choose the other option.

And now I'm in Web Inspector.The first thing I want to address hereis the overall size of the page.By default, Safari on iPhone renders the web pageas if it were the size of a desktop browser,and then it scales that larger content downso it all fits on screen.But I don't want this behavior heresince it makes the text too small.So I'll use a very common practicewhen it comes to web design for iPhone.I'll add a viewport meta-tag to tell Safarinot to scale the content this way.I'll select the Head element,add a Child element,and add the contentsof that viewport meta-tag.I'll add the tag, and the page updates livein the simulator in response to that change.Now all the text is at a readable size,but it doesn't all fit on screen,which is my next problem.I want to inspect the elements on this pageto understand why it lays out like this.

I'll look at the body tag,and I notice there's this div herethat contains all the content on the page.If I focus itand look in the stylesheet sidebar to the right,I notice that the elementhas a fixed width of 850.That would make sense on a desktop,where windows can be really wideand you'd want the text to wrap at some point.But that doesn't work on iPhonebecause the phone just isn't that wide.I think it would make more sense hereif that rule set a maximum width for the contentrather than demanding an exact width.And I can simply edit the rule here.I'll click widthand change it to max-width,and the page in the simulator updatesto reflect that change.Now the content's width is much more appropriate for iPhone,and all of the text fits on screen.This looks much better now, but these changes that I've madeare only temporary to this Inspector session.I want to actually save these changes backinto my project so I don't lose them.And it's really easy to save an updated copyof the stylesheet while I work in the stylesheet Inspector.I can simply type Command+Sto save my stylesheet that has that updated rule.And I'll overwrite the new_tab_page.cssin my project.

But for the viewport change, I added that tagto a live web page rather than a static resource,so I'll have to make the same change to the original source.I'll select that tag,copy it,go back to Xcode,open up that source for the New Tab page,and paste the contents there.

So the next time I run Sea Creator,it'll use that updated page source and stylesheet,and it'll look just as good again.And that's been a few examples of using Web Inspectorto look under the hood of a web extension,understand exactly what's happening,and experiment with potential changeswhile iterating on the extension.For now, I'm only going to look at the New Tab page,but later on in development, I should obviously go testall the other parts of the extension on iOS,and I'd use the same tools and techniques for that.You can use Safari's extension settings on iOSto view any errors in the configurationof your Web Extension.Specifically, Sea Creator had the fatal errorof using a persistent background page,but there may also be non-fatal warnings herethat you should check out.These details will only appear in Settingsfor debug builds of your app from Xcodeand not for copies from the App Store or TestFlight.

As you make changes to your web extension,you simply run your app again to update the extensionon the device or simulator.And of course, Web Inspector allows youto investigate issues with your extension's web content.Remember that in order to access Web Inspector,I had to enable the Develop menuin Safari's Advanced Preferences on the Mac.In my demo, I used the iOS simulator for my extension,but if you wanted to use a physical iOS device,you would also need to enable Web Inspector supporton that device in Safari's Advanced Settings.To take a deeper dive into Web Inspectorand learn about some of its newest features,check out Discover Web Inspector improvements.Now that I've created a Safari Web Extension for iOSand I've debugged a few basic issues,I'd like to walk through some best practices to keep in mind,including some things you might need to watch out foras you build an extension for Safari on iOS.I'll focus on five topicsthat may be relevant to your extension,starting with non-persistent background pages.The background page is a web page that the browser loadsto run your extension's background script.And this page allows your extension to handle eventssent by the browser or other parts of your extension.But keeping this page loaded has a performance cost.It can use memory and poweras if you were keeping one more tab open and runningfor every enabled extension.Keeping all these pages loaded all the timecan be pretty wasteful.But you can make a background page non-persistent,which means the browser will only load it when your extensionactually needs to do work, and the browser can laterunload that page when it's been idle for some time.That way, the performance cost is only paidwhile your extension is doing something useful.This is important because background pages must benon-persistent on iOS, where system memoryand battery life are especially at a premium.The web extension templates in Xcode already comewith a non-persistent background page,so they're ready to run on iOS.But if you have an existing extensionthat uses a persistent background pagelike Sea Creator did,you'll need to change it to be non-persistent.And you can do that by adding that "persistent:" False keyin the background section of your manifest.To learn more about some best practicesand potential issues you may facewhen updating an extensionto use a non-persistent background page,check outExplore Safari Web Extension Improvements.Up next,let's talk about responsive design.As we learned with Sea Creator,bringing an extension to iOSmeans its web content may be renderedin new environments that you haven't considered before.Just like I did with Sea Creator's New Tab page,be sure to test the layout of your extension's web contenton iPhone and iPad and use a responsive designthat can accommodate various screen sizes.But the difference in screen size isn'tthe only consideration when it comesto making your web content look great on iOS.Let me tell you about a few things you should be aware of.If your extension has full-page web contentthat lays out important elements near the bottom of the screen,you may find it being covered by Safari's Tab Baror the device's home indicator.In CSS terminology, this area near the edgeof the screen where content may be partially hiddenis called the unsafe area,while the usable areaof the viewport is called the safe area.By using CSS environment variables,you can calculate the safe area insetto make sure important elements are positionedwithin the safe area.On iPhone, this is also worth considering in Landscape,where devices may have safe area insetson the left and right side of the display as well.By using similar CSSand by specifying the viewport-fit parameterin your viewport,you can give your web content an edge-to-edge designthat still keeps important content within the safe area.

Check out Design for Safari 15 to learn more about these APIsthat can make your web content feel more at home on iOS.On iPad and desktop browsers,if your extension has a pop-up page,you may be used to it being shown as a popoverthat's comfortably sized to fit its content.But on iPhone, however,Safari will display this web page as a sheet,which may be a surprise to your content.The sheet spans the full width of the device,and it may be laid out tallerthan the content expects.In this screenshot of an early version of Sea Creator,the content didn't have much paddingfrom the edge of the screen,and we set a background color on an individual elementin the page rather than on the body.So the text looks a bit crampedand the background doesn't fillthe whole page.But we've since updated the alignmentand padding of the contentto give it a little more space to breathe,and we now specify a background coloron the body so it covers the whole sheet.If your extension has a pop-up page,think about whether you should make similar changesfor your extension.And note that Safari will use a similar presentationin Landscape as well.Be sure to test your extension's interfacein these configurations to make sure its layout makes sensewhen given this extra space.And finally among the design considerations,I want to mention Dynamic Type.Dynamic Type is a feature that allows usersto adjust the size of text and other visual elements.You can make content smaller to fit moreor larger so it's more visible.Be sure to test your extension's interfaceunder smaller or larger text sizes to make sure it looks all rightwith any size the user chooses.To help your web content make the most of Dynamic Type,WebKit has a variety of system fontsthat respect the user's text size preferenceand resize to match.You should adopt these fonts in your extensionso that its text remains comfortably readable to the user,just like the rest of Safari's interface.So the main takeaway here isto design your extension's web contentwith Safari's UI in mind.Test any full page web content on iPhoneto make sure that it adapts well to the screen sizeand doesn't clash with Safari's UIat the bottom of the screen.You should test your pop-up web page on iPhone to make sureits layout makes sense with the sheet-style presentation,and you should test your interfaceacross a wide range of Dynamic Type sizesto make sure it adjusts for the user's preference.For more tips on designing web content to look greatin Safari's new interface,check out Design for Safari 15.Up next, pointer events.

If your extension currently depends on handling mouse eventsfor arbitrary clicks and drags,be aware that the same eventswon't be sent when the user taps on iOS.You should instead adopt the Pointer Events API.It's similar to the Mouse Events API,and it works just the same with mouse input,but the Pointer Events API also reports touchesand Apple Pencil input.And now let's talkabout the Web Extension Windows API.On desktop browsers,users may have multiple windows openand your Web Extension can use the browser.windows APIto work with these windows.And the same is true on iPad,where you can also open multiple windows of Safari.Each Safari window might be full screen,or it might be in split view,side-by-side with another app,maybe another Safari.Under the hood though,each of these windows is actuallycalled a scene on iOS.If your extension uses the Windows API,you should know that each sceneof Safari actually has two windows:one for regular browsing and one for Private browsing.This is also true on iPhone,even though there's only one scene of Safari.If I call the browser.windows.getAll APIto query what windows are open,then the API returnsthese two window objects.In the first window,the incognito property is false,and focused is true.This represents the window I'm looking at,which is in regular browsingand not Private Browsing.The second window holds the Private Browsing tabsin the Safari scene.And of course, its properties are different from the first window.Incognito is true, and focused is false.Now when I switch Safari to Private Browsingand call windows.getAll again,the API returns different window objects.Now the focused property has changed in both windows,and the second window now has focus.

This works exactly the same on iPadwhere one Safari sceneis represented by two windows.But if I open a second scene of Safari in split view,the API would now report four windows.And if my extension listens for the windows.onCreated event,it would observe that event fire twicewhen opening split view,once for each of the two new windowsin the new Safari scene.So if you use this API, keep this model in mindas you encounter extra windowsyou might not expect at first.In addition to this model of what a window actually is,there are a few limitations of the windows APIthat may affect your extension.The methods to create, remove,and update the state of windows aren't available.On iOS, window placementis fully controlled by the user,not any app or extension.The windows.onRemoved event won't be firedas you'd maybe expect when the user closes Safarifrom the app switcher.That doesn't truly close or remove a window.It just leaves it for the user to pick upwhere they left off later.And note that these restrictions only applyto the windows themselvesand not the tabs within those windows.With the browser.tabs API,Web Extensions still have full control to add,remove, and update individual tabs as they'd like.Now, last up in the best practicesis feature detection.When bringing an existing extension to iOS,you may find some APIs are unavailable--for example, the windows APIs that I mentioned a moment ago.But there are a few others, like context menusand WebRequest.If non-essential parts of your extension use such APIs,be sure to use feature detection to handle the casethat they're not available.So, instead of unconditionallycalling these APIs,conditionalize that code basedon the existence of those APIs,so you can cleanly exclude parts of your extensionand make it more flexible when it comesto which browsers it supports.You should also use this pattern when adopting new APIsthat are added in the future,as they might not immediately be availableacross all browsers or in previous versionsof browsers that some users may still be using.And that wraps up the best practices.I've now covered many parts of Safari Web Extensions,but I've saved arguably the most important topic for last,and that's user privacy.User privacy is a huge part of everything we do,so we believe users deserve transparency and controlwhen it comes to how their personal data is handled.And of course that includes everything they do in Safari.Web Extensions can gain a tremendous amountof access to the user's browsing,so the decision of whether that should be allowedand on which websites should be up to the user.Historically, other browsers would give an extensionfull access to every website it requestsright away when you turn it on,which is potentially asking you to sacrifice privacy up frontjust to get a taste of the extension.But Safari aims to do better by providing transparencyand control to Web Extension userswith an opt-in model where extensions are only given accessto websites when the user consents.You caught a glimpse of this earlier with Sea Creator.It didn't immediately start modifying my pageswhen I turned it on, but it was only able to do thatwhen I explicitly told Safari,"Yes, I want to use this extension here,and I'm okay with it having access."And once I give an extension that access,Safari tells me in the Tab Barthat I have an extension running on this page,so I know that the extensionmight be seeing my web browsing here.But if I navigate to any websitethat I haven't yet allowed the extension to access,that indicator disappears.And I know that that extension isn't running on this pageand can't see what I'm doing here.Let's look at this permissions model in more detail.Again, users opt in to your extensionwhen they choose to use it on specific websites.Safari will ask the user for consentby presenting a dialog which makes it clearwhich websites the extension is trying to access.This happens when the user invokes your extensionby selecting it in the Action menuor by using any of its keyboard shortcuts.And this consent is requiredfor any privacy sensitive API to work.Specifically,any API that reveals the URLor title of a tab will only include this infoif your extension has permission for that URL.The Cookies API will only let your extensionread and write cookies for websitesyour extension has permission for.And injecting JavaScript and stylesheets willonly be allowed on websites where,you guessed it, your extension has permission.

If your extension's scripts call any of these APIswhen your extension doesn't have the required permissionsbut hasn't asked the user yet,Safari will wait to call your completion handlersand will show a non-disruptive bannerat the top of the screen.This lets the user know that your extensionwants some more access, and they can then review the setof websites your extension is asking for,and they can make a decision to allowor reject access for those websites.You should avoid requesting more permission this waythan your extension really needs.For some types of extensions,this way of thinking about permissionmight be a bit more than you need.For example, extensions that share or annotateindividual web pages don't need full access to the siteany time the user visits in any tab,but rather they just want permission onceto do one thing at a time for the user.

And there's a great solution for those extensionscalled the activeTab permission.When your extension requests the activeTab permission,Safari will automatically grant your extension permissionon tabs where the userexplicitly uses your extension.And this permission will be limitedto just the current website in just the current tab.So it'll be revoked if the user navigates that tabto a different website.Safari won't display a prompt when granting this permission,since there's no long-term commitment needed from the user.

To adopt this feature, simply add activeTabto the Permissions section of your manifest.

So all of this is to say that in Safari,users are always in controlof which websites their extensions can work on.So be aware that your extension won't automatically be ableto go to work on every page the user visits.For many extensions, the activeTab permissionis a great way to get access to just the pageswhere the user is using your extensionwithout bugging themabout any access beyond that.All of these concepts are the sameacross all our platforms that support Safari Web Extensions.To see this in action on macOS and get a closer lookat updating an extension to use activeTab, check outMeet Safari Web Extensions from WWDC 2020.And that's the privacy preserving permissions modelof Safari Web Extensions.Along with everything else I've covered today,I hope this gives you a more complete viewof Safari Web Extensions on iOS and the tools availableto you for building them.We're so excited to see the Web Extension experiencesthat will be brought to Safari on iOS 15,including the many extensions we already love on the Mac todaybut also the great new extensionsthat are yet to come.So if you're new to extension development,I encourage you to check out the linked resourcesassociated with this session.There, you'll find sample code that you can downloadand try out for yourself.And you can read more about the Web Extension APIsavailable to you in Apple's developer documentationand the MDN Web Docs.If you already develop a Web Extensionfor another browser or for Safari on the Mac,I encourage you to try out the Safari Web Extension Converterin Xcode 13to easily bring your extension to iOS.If you have feedback like bug reports, suggestions,or compatibility issues, I encourage you to send us that feedbackat feedbackassistant.apple.com.You can also reach out to us at the Apple Developer Forumsif you'd like to get in touch or have questions.And finally, I'd like to again recommendtwo other sessions you may be interested in.Explore Safari Web Extension Improvements will teach youabout some recent API additions to Safari Web Extensions.And Design for Safari 15 will show youhow to make your web content look greatwith Safari's new design in iOS 15.Thanks for watching, and have a great WWDC.[upbeat music]
