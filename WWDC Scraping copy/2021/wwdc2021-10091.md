will be joined by my colleague, Kevin.Notifications are a key componentof the application experienceand we will cover new ways to enhance them,along with elevating certain categories of notifications.We will start out by coveringsome visual updates to notificationsand how to augment them with new API.Then we will do an overview of new management controlsand how these are relevant to communicationand Time Sensitive notifications.Then we will focus on notification interruptionsand cover new APIs to control them.After which, we will hone inon the two types of notifications --Time Sensitive and communication --and cover ways in which these can be configured.Let's begin by going over some visual updatesto notifications.Now, notifications have a new lookwith greater focus on the content and the associated mediaalong with the application icon.The rich notification presentationand accompanying actionshave been updated to match the system style.You can now associate notification actions with icons.Iconography conveys what the action will doand provides visual context next to the action.Here there are two notification actions --like and comment --and these are set on the custom notification category.To add icons to these actions,create objects of type UNNotificationActionIconwith the image name,either for a system image or a template image.Then provide these icons to the respective constructorsfor UNNotificationAction.When a notification associated with this category is expanded,the actions are presentedalong with the icons that were provided for them.Because notifications display the app icon at a larger size,provide a high-resolution icon with the application bundle.Ensure content extensions continue to work withthe new presentation and layout of the rich notifications,and adopt icons for notification actions to add more context.Next, let's go over new notification management options.There are new system controls which affect the deliveryand interruption of notifications from applications.These are notification summary and Focus.Let's discuss notification summary first.Notifications can now be deliveredat scheduled times in the day as a summary.This reduces the number of active interruptionsfrom incoming notifications and presents them collectivelyat preset times.All notifications delivered to the summary on a scheduleare present in the notification list on the Lock screen.Include media attachments with the notification contentso there is a better chance for that notificationto be featured at the top of the notification summary.Adopt the new API to provide a relevance scorefor the notification contentso the right notifications from the application get featuredin the notification summary as well.The other management tool relevant to notificationsis Focus.The device can be set in a particular Focusbased on the activity or time of daysuch as Reading, Sleep, or Work.When in such a configuration,the device will filter the presentationand interruption of notifications.Focus configurationallows selecting people and applicationsthat can send interruptive notifications.For example, during the Work Focus,Mail and Messages are allowed to send notifications,along with direct communication from coworkers.So notification summary and Focuscontrol which applications can send interruptive notificationsand when.This allows better management of interruptionsthroughout the day.There is opportunity for notifications to break throughthese management controls, but only if allowed to do so.It is also possible for communicationand Time Sensitive notifications to break through.Next let's discuss how applicationscan control interruptions tied to notifications.There is a new API for interruption levelsas part of the UserNotifications framework.There are four distinct interruption levelsthat are supported.These are Passive, Active, Time Sensitive, and Critical.Notifications with Passive interruption leveldo not alert or light up the screen,and do not break through system controls.These notifications are deliveredto the notification list silentlyand are available the next time the list is viewed.Passive interruption should be used for notificationsthat do not require immediate attention to interruptbut should be seen eventually.Some examples are dining recommendationsand new episode availability.Active interruption resembles the behavior that exists today,where notifications will play sound and vibrationsand light up the screen.These notifications will not break throughsystem management of notifications.This is the default interruption level.Active interruption should be used for notificationsthat do not warrant interrupting if the system is configurednot to be interrupted currently.Some examples are sports updatesand live stream video notifications.Time Sensitive notifications alertjust like active notifications.These are special becausethey can break through system controlssuch as notification summary and Focus,if it has been allowed.These notifications should only be usedwhen it is relevant to actively interrupt,requiring immediate attention.Some instances are account securityand package delivery alerts.Lastly, Critical interruption level is equivalentto the Critical notification support that exists in iOS 14.Notifications with this interruption levelactively alert, break through system controls,and also bypass the ringer switch on the device.Because of this disruptive behavior,critical interruption will continueto require an approved entitlement.Some use cases for critical notificationsare severe weather and local safety alerts.To support the new API in the UserNotifications framework,there is a new enum for UNNotificationInterruptionLevelwith the different levels defined.Set this interruption level while configuringthe content object for the notification request.Passive is set in this example.If no interruption level is provided,then the default level is used.For a push notification payload, provide a new key-value pair,with the key interruption level.Here again, set the interruption level as passive.When this notification is delivered to the device,it will be visible on the Lock screenwithout any interruptions, since it was configured as passive.Another form of interruption tied to notificationsis Announce.Siri can announce notificationsif there are compatible devices --such as AirPods Pro and AirPods Max -- connected.To get this announce behavior in iOS 14,notifications had to be tied to a categorythat requests the AllowAnnouncement option.In iOS 15, the requirement for this category optionis deprecated.Now announce is supported for any notificationwhile connected to a supported audio device.Communication and Time Sensitive notificationswill be announced by default.While connected to CarPlay, communication notificationscan be configured to announce automatically,making the experience more seamless.Next let's focus on Time Sensitive notificationsand how to configure them.Time Sensitive notificationsare those that require immediate attention.Because of their importance,these can breakthrough system controlssuch as notification summary and Focus if allowed to do so.An example of a Time Sensitive notificationis one from Reminders about taking medication.This notification is posted immediately and prominently,breaking through the Work Focus.It is important to maintain trustwhen sending Time Sensitive notifications.Do not overuse their interruptive natureand only use them when it is relevant to do so.Know that there is an option to turn off Time Sensitive alertsor even all notifications from an application.To configure Time Sensitive notifications,enable the associated capability via Xcodefor your application.Set the Time Sensitive interruption levelon the notification request being posted.For a local notification,the Time Sensitive interruption levelis set on the content object.For a push payload,set the interruption-level key with value as time-sensitive.When delivered,this notification is posted prominently,highlighting the urgency.Let's discuss communication notifications.And to tell you all about them, let me hand over to Kevin.Kevin?Kevin Harrington: Thanks, Kritarth.I'm Kevin, an engineer

♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Kritarth Jain: Hi there and welcome to"Send communication and Time Sensitive notifications."I am Kritarth, an engineer on the Notifications team,and later I will be joined by my colleague, Kevin.

Notifications are a key componentof the application experienceand we will cover new ways to enhance them,along with elevating certain categories of notifications.

We will start out by coveringsome visual updates to notificationsand how to augment them with new API.

Then we will do an overview of new management controlsand how these are relevant to communicationand Time Sensitive notifications.

Then we will focus on notification interruptionsand cover new APIs to control them.

After which, we will hone inon the two types of notifications --Time Sensitive and communication --and cover ways in which these can be configured.

Let's begin by going over some visual updatesto notifications.

Now, notifications have a new lookwith greater focus on the content and the associated mediaalong with the application icon.

The rich notification presentationand accompanying actionshave been updated to match the system style.

You can now associate notification actions with icons.

Iconography conveys what the action will doand provides visual context next to the action.

Here there are two notification actions --like and comment --and these are set on the custom notification category.

To add icons to these actions,create objects of type UNNotificationActionIconwith the image name,either for a system image or a template image.

Then provide these icons to the respective constructorsfor UNNotificationAction.

When a notification associated with this category is expanded,the actions are presentedalong with the icons that were provided for them.

Because notifications display the app icon at a larger size,provide a high-resolution icon with the application bundle.

Ensure content extensions continue to work withthe new presentation and layout of the rich notifications,and adopt icons for notification actions to add more context.

Next, let's go over new notification management options.

There are new system controls which affect the deliveryand interruption of notifications from applications.

These are notification summary and Focus.

Let's discuss notification summary first.

Notifications can now be deliveredat scheduled times in the day as a summary.

This reduces the number of active interruptionsfrom incoming notifications and presents them collectivelyat preset times.

All notifications delivered to the summary on a scheduleare present in the notification list on the Lock screen.

Include media attachments with the notification contentso there is a better chance for that notificationto be featured at the top of the notification summary.

Adopt the new API to provide a relevance scorefor the notification contentso the right notifications from the application get featuredin the notification summary as well.

The other management tool relevant to notificationsis Focus.

The device can be set in a particular Focusbased on the activity or time of daysuch as Reading, Sleep, or Work.

When in such a configuration,the device will filter the presentationand interruption of notifications.

Focus configurationallows selecting people and applicationsthat can send interruptive notifications.

For example, during the Work Focus,Mail and Messages are allowed to send notifications,along with direct communication from coworkers.

So notification summary and Focuscontrol which applications can send interruptive notificationsand when.

This allows better management of interruptionsthroughout the day.

There is opportunity for notifications to break throughthese management controls, but only if allowed to do so.

It is also possible for communicationand Time Sensitive notifications to break through.

Next let's discuss how applicationscan control interruptions tied to notifications.

There is a new API for interruption levelsas part of the UserNotifications framework.

There are four distinct interruption levelsthat are supported.

These are Passive, Active, Time Sensitive, and Critical.

Notifications with Passive interruption leveldo not alert or light up the screen,and do not break through system controls.

These notifications are deliveredto the notification list silentlyand are available the next time the list is viewed.

Passive interruption should be used for notificationsthat do not require immediate attention to interruptbut should be seen eventually.

Some examples are dining recommendationsand new episode availability.

Active interruption resembles the behavior that exists today,where notifications will play sound and vibrationsand light up the screen.

These notifications will not break throughsystem management of notifications.

This is the default interruption level.

Active interruption should be used for notificationsthat do not warrant interrupting if the system is configurednot to be interrupted currently.

Some examples are sports updatesand live stream video notifications.

Time Sensitive notifications alertjust like active notifications.

These are special becausethey can break through system controlssuch as notification summary and Focus,if it has been allowed.

These notifications should only be usedwhen it is relevant to actively interrupt,requiring immediate attention.

Some instances are account securityand package delivery alerts.

Lastly, Critical interruption level is equivalentto the Critical notification support that exists in iOS 14.

Notifications with this interruption levelactively alert, break through system controls,and also bypass the ringer switch on the device.

Because of this disruptive behavior,critical interruption will continueto require an approved entitlement.

Some use cases for critical notificationsare severe weather and local safety alerts.

To support the new API in the UserNotifications framework,there is a new enum for UNNotificationInterruptionLevelwith the different levels defined.

Set this interruption level while configuringthe content object for the notification request.

Passive is set in this example.

If no interruption level is provided,then the default level is used.

For a push notification payload, provide a new key-value pair,with the key interruption level.

Here again, set the interruption level as passive.

When this notification is delivered to the device,it will be visible on the Lock screenwithout any interruptions, since it was configured as passive.

Another form of interruption tied to notificationsis Announce.

Siri can announce notificationsif there are compatible devices --such as AirPods Pro and AirPods Max -- connected.

To get this announce behavior in iOS 14,notifications had to be tied to a categorythat requests the AllowAnnouncement option.

In iOS 15, the requirement for this category optionis deprecated.

Now announce is supported for any notificationwhile connected to a supported audio device.

Communication and Time Sensitive notificationswill be announced by default.

While connected to CarPlay, communication notificationscan be configured to announce automatically,making the experience more seamless.

Next let's focus on Time Sensitive notificationsand how to configure them.

Time Sensitive notificationsare those that require immediate attention.

Because of their importance,these can breakthrough system controlssuch as notification summary and Focus if allowed to do so.

An example of a Time Sensitive notificationis one from Reminders about taking medication.

This notification is posted immediately and prominently,breaking through the Work Focus.

It is important to maintain trustwhen sending Time Sensitive notifications.

Do not overuse their interruptive natureand only use them when it is relevant to do so.

Know that there is an option to turn off Time Sensitive alertsor even all notifications from an application.

To configure Time Sensitive notifications,enable the associated capability via Xcodefor your application.

Set the Time Sensitive interruption levelon the notification request being posted.

For a local notification,the Time Sensitive interruption levelis set on the content object.

For a push payload,set the interruption-level key with value as time-sensitive.

When delivered,this notification is posted prominently,highlighting the urgency.

Let's discuss communication notifications.

And to tell you all about them, let me hand over to Kevin.

Kevin?Kevin Harrington: Thanks, Kritarth.

I'm Kevin, an engineer on the Notifications team.

There's an importance for urgent notificationsbreaking through Focus and notification summaries.

Communications from people also warrantelevated notification delivery.

These communications can come in many forms,including calls and messages.

I will highlight a new API that allows your applicationsto signal what notifications are communications,and the people associated with those communications.

The importance of communication notificationsis determined by user decisions.

Siri Suggestions helps inform these decisions,suggesting important people that should be allowed to interrupt.

As your user interacts with the device --taking calls, joining FaceTimes, sending messages --Siri learns who is a candidate to break through Focusand Notification Summaries.

In iOS 15, communication notificationsget a richer user experience.

Most visible are the prominent avatars.

The title and subtitle are standardized.

It always includes the sender in the title,and in the case of group communications,recipients in the subtitle.

The title and subtitle text are localized and formattedfor all devices, across platforms.

For example, watch prefers to show just first namesfor recipients of a group communication.

Siri will now announcethe contents of communication notificationson supported devices including HomePod, AirPods, and CarPlay.

And Siri will provide suggestionsto help prioritize these communication notifications.

People in your apps will get associatedwith people in Contacts.

These associations are shown as suggestionson notifications.

Once a user confirms a suggestion,Siri Shortcuts are available for taskswith those people in your app.

Siri will suggest relevant people to break throughin the Focus configuration -- including those peopleassociated with communications in your app.

To make these decisions on what is and isn't a communication,this new API lets you add SiriKit call and message intentsto Notifications.

Intents are driven by common tasks.

Your app donates these intents when events happen,like placing a call or receiving a message.

From there, Siri provides shortcuts and suggestionsbased on these intents,like people in your apps to message from share sheetor to start a call from your app via Siri.

This new API associates these same intents with notificationsto further integrate your apps into the Siri ecosystem.

Using SiriKit intents for communication notificationswill increase engagement in your appswhile maintaining consistencythroughout your app, Siri, and system UI.

The intents that represent relevant communicationsare the StartCall and SendMessage intents.

The NotificationContentProviding protocol is the mechanismto associate intents with notifications.

On a NotificationContent object,call updating with a ContentProviding intentfor communication treatment.

StartCall and SendMessage intents conforms to providing.

Communication notifications are deliveredthrough Apple Push Notification service.

You need to update a NotificationContent objectwith a SiriKit intentin your app's NotificationServiceExtension.

SiriKit intents are local to the device,and thus must be serviced locally.

The service extension is for exactly these cases.

It is the place to customize the content of a remote notificationbefore it is delivered.

You can also do this in your main app processfor local notifications.

In your didReceive function,update the content of a push payload with an intent.

For messaging notifications, create a SendMessageIntent.

And for call-related notifications,use a StartCallIntent.

Create an interaction to tell Siri intelligencewhat is happening.

In a notification extension,the interaction direction is always incoming.

This is an event that is happening to the user;they are receiving the incoming call.

Next, you need to donate the interaction.

Donations also help the systemmake better suggestions in the future.

Update the content of your notification with the intent.

And finally, call the contentHandlerwith the returned intent.

Donations are required so Siri can learn from eventsthat happen in your apps.

The interaction directionis always incoming for notifications.

For other SiriKit uses, the direction can be outgoingfor actions initiated on the device,like sending an outgoing message or placing a call.

Only system objects that conformto content providing are supported.

Do not conform your objects to content providing.

To send communication notifications,enable the communication capability via Xcodefor your application.

Support communication intents by adding intent types toyour user activity types array in Info.plistor by implementing an intents extension.

Donate communication intents when the usertakes actions in your app foreground,like when the users hits send after composing a message.

Siri then uses outgoing intents to better aidein who should be suggestedto break through Focus and Summaries.

Same for Contacts suggestions.

For this feature,Siri only learns from outgoing intent donations,so Contacts are not cluttered by people not engaged with --like spam callers.

The proper usage of communication intentsis fundamental to an intelligent notification experience,and there are a few gotchas to cover.

Intent persons are the building blocksof SendMessage and StartCall intents.

Each and every parameter you populateprovides a richer and more intelligent user experience.

Same goes with creating intents with intent persons;each and every parameter you populateprovides a richer and more intelligent user experience.

Start using intents if you don't already.

Intents will provide more visibility to your appin notifications, share sheet, Contacts, and Spotlight.

And you can use SiriKit to offer Siri Shortcutslike sending a message or starting a call.

Get in the habit of donating intentsfor both incoming and outgoing interactions.

You might already be donating outgoing intents.

Start donating incoming StartCalland SendMessage intents in your service extension.

This is fundamentalto the communication notification experience.

If your app doesn't already usea notification service extension,you'll want to add one.

Finally, put the pieces togetherby using the content providing protocolto decorate each notification you want deliveredas a communication.

We've covered a lot in this session,from visual updates to communication notifications.

Here are a few takeaways.

Account for the new visual updates and management optionsand ensure that notifications work seamlessly with them.

Adopt interruption levels to have better controlover how a notification interruptsin synergy with system controls.

Use Time Sensitive notifications when relevantto prominently interrupt and get automatic behaviorssuch as breakthrough and announce.

Implement and donate call and messaging intentsto get the upgraded communication experiencetied to notifications,along with breakthrough and announce behavior.

We can't wait to see all the new and amazing experiencesyou build around notifications.

We hope you all have a great WWDC!♪
