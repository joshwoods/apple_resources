your appsusing App Attest and DeviceCheck.At Apple, we're constantly workingto ensure that the App Storeis a safe and trusted place for customers and developers.In this video, we will cover the engineering specifics.For business and conceptual details,see "Safeguard your accounts, promotions, and content" videofrom WWDC 2021.In iOS 11, we introduced the DeviceCheck framework.DeviceCheck helps mitigate fraud on promotional offerings.Suppose you are introducing a new feature in your app.To promote the feature,you offer a free, single-use item.Someone might abuse the promotionby reinstalling the app over and over againjust to claim the free item.Likely, you'll want to limit promotional itemsto once per device, instead of allowing the appto be installed repeatedly and having the promotion reused.Now, DeviceCheck can help you detectwhether a device has received a promotion offer,or if a device has participated in fraudulent activity.It allows you to persistently store two bits of informationand a timestamp associated with one device on Apple servers.It is up to you to decide what these bits mean to your applications.The state will be maintained by Applefor you to update and query.The bits are shared by all apps from a developer.Please keep that in mind when assigning meanings to the bitsso they are applicable across all your apps.The state persists across app reinstallation,device transfer between users,and even "Erase all contents and settings."Consider using the timestamp to reset the bitson a period of your choosing,based on your promotional and business strategies.To find out more about DeviceCheck,see the "Privacy and Your Apps" videofrom WWDC 2017and the DeviceCheck Framework documentation.So that's DeviceCheck.Next, I'm going to talk about App Attest,also available under the DeviceCheck Framework.When your service receives a request,it can be hard to know whether it really is from your app.App Attest allows your appto attach a hardware-backed assertionas a part of the request.Your server can use assertion to verify the request camefrom your genuine app, on a genuine Apple device.Imagine, you designed a beautiful appthat encourages travel to discover collectibles,only to find that a modified app allowedcollecting everything without ever leaving home.Or imagine players' frustrationseeing others racing up the leaderboards,by using cheats to get unlimited boostsin a competitive multiplayer racing game.Or imagine waking up on a Saturdayand, much to your delight,seeing a very high request volume on your server,but after investigation,you find the calls aren't coming from your app at all.App Attest can help you identify genuineand modified versions of your app,letting you protect your app experience and your business.App Attest provides three key properties that you cantake advantage of to protect you and your customers.App Attest lets your service verify a request camefrom a legitimate instance of your appby satisfying three conditions:the request came from a genuine Apple device,running your genuine application,and that the payload has not been tampered with.Let's go through how App Attest provideseach of these properties.At the heart of App Attest is a secure key pairand an attestation, signed by Apple,certifying that the key pair originatesfrom a genuine Apple device.The private key is stored and accessibleonly through the Secure Enclave using the App Attest API.Your app can sign requests to your service with the key,and your service can then check the signature to verifythe request was generated on a genuine Apple device.For an app to execute on an Apple device,it must be signed.A person making unauthorized modifications to your appmust re-sign it with an identity they control.This unavoidably modifies the app identity.We include a hash of the app identity in the attestation.By comparing your app identity with the one includedin the attestation, you can determinewhether the caller is using a modified version.Now that you know the request camefrom a genuine device and your genuine app,let's talk about the request payload.Before sending a payload to your server,you can instruct App Attest to sign a digestof the payload using the attested key.This creates an assertion of the payload.Your app should transmit the payloadand the assertion to your service.By verifying the assertion against the payload,you can trust that the payload was not tampered with in transit.Those are three key properties.Now let's talk a bit about privacy.Here at Apple, we care deeply about privacy.We believe that privacy is an essential foundationfor a healthy app ecosystem.Each element of App Attest has been built with privacy in mind.The attestations are designed to provide assuranceof a genuine device,while protecting against tracking.The attestations are anonymousand include no hardware identifiers.App Attest keys are unique per installation of your app.This means that an App Attest key will not surviveapp reinstallation, is not backed up,and is not synced across devices.Keep this in mind when designing your app.Now that you understand the value App Attest provides,let's dive into the detailsof incorporating it into your app.There are three basic parts to incorporateApp Attest into your app.Creating an App Attest key, attesting and verifying the key,and generating and verifying assertions.Let's start with creating an App Attest Key.All App Attest calls should be guardedby the isSupported property.App Attest is supportedon devices that have a Secure Enclave,but there are cases, such as App Extensions,where isSupported will still return false.Your app must handle these cases gracefully.Instead of immediately blocking access,use failures as a risk signal.First, classify the caller as untrusted.Then, based on your risk assessment logic,evaluate whether to allow the clientto use sensitive features.Another approach is to monitorfor a sudden increase in devicesclaiming they don't support App Attestwhen calling your service.If the ratio of devices supporting App Attestsuddenly decreases, it may be a signof modified apps trying to bypass your checks.With an App Attest key successfully generated,let's go ahead and attest the key.To prevent man-in-the-middle and replay attacks,we need a one-time server challenge.Let's have your server issue the challenge to the app.To link the attestation with a user account IDor other values,hash those values togetherwith the challenge to create the clientDataHash.Using the clientDataHash, along with the keyIdfrom the previous step, we can now call attestKey API.attestKey will use the private key to createa hardware attestation request for the device,and submit the request to Apple for verification.Once verified, Apple will returnan anonymous attestation object to your app.Send the attestation, along with any custom payload,back to your server for verification.OK, now that your app has sent the attestationto your server, let's try to verify it.The attestation follows the Web Authentication standardand contains three parts:a list of certificates signed by Apple,an Authenticator Data structure, and a risk metric receipt.Let's look at the important pieces that you need to verify.The certificate section contains the leafand intermediate certificates.The App Attest root certificate is availablein the Apple Private PKI repository.Validating the full certificate chaintells you the device is a genuine Apple device.When you called attestKey, a single-use hash,known as a nonce, was createdfrom the clientDataHash and other data.That nonce is included in the leaf certificate.To prevent tampering, you'll reconstruct the nonceon your server and verify it matches.The authenticator data block contains multiple properties,including a hash of the app identity,that you can use to verify it is your app calling you.The key attestation also contains a receipt that you canstore and use later to request a risk metric from Apple.I will cover more information about it later in the video.If everything checks out, the App Attest Key is genuine.Store the key associated with the client datafor use to verify subsequent requests.Not all failures are due to an invalid attestation.Gracefully handle scenarios,such as isSupported returning false,being throttled during ramp up,or general network failures.You can then incorporate failuresas signals in your overall risk assessment.For further details on implementing the verification,please see the documentation.Calling the attest-Key API generates a network callfrom your app to App Attest service.This only happens once per app instance.However, if you have a large install base,collectively, your app may send many requests to App Attest.In order to manage resources and avoid being rate limited,make sure you gradually enable this featureacross your install base.For example,if you have a million daily active users,you can probably ramp up over a day or so.If you have a billion daily active users, nice work!You should ramp up over a month or more.Now that you have the attested key, you can usethe generateAssertion API call to protectsensitive communication between your app and your server.The assertion flow is simpler than attestation,as the Apple servers are no longer involved.All assertions using the key are generatedon-device and validated on your server.Start by requesting a unique challenge from the server,then generate a digest of the payloadand call generateAssertion.generateAssertion will use the digest to computea nonce and sign it with the App Attest key.Your app can then send the payloadand the assertion to your server.Finally, your server should verify the payload.Assertion payloads contains this high-level structure.Signature and Authenticator Data.To validate the signature, reverse the processto reconstruct the nonce on your server.Then use the public key to verify the signature.If the signature is valid,you can trust the payload is unmodified.The authenticator data section contains the app identity hash.Validate the hash to ensure the assertionis from your genuine app.The authenticator data also includesan ever-increasing counter.To help protect against replay attacks,store the counter value on your server,and expect it to increase with each subsequent request.With the key, you can now repeat this processas much as you need.While generating an assertion doesn't call Apple servers,it's a cryptographic operation, which adds some latency.You should factor this into your designwhen incorporating App Attest into your app.Assertions are a good fit for importantbut infrequent calls, and the calls that can dealwith the additional latency and the computation required.For frequent real-time network commands,assertions may not be suitable.Congratulations!You have now completed the basic implementation of App Attest.With this implementation alone, you can start classifyingyour incoming server requests as genuine and modified,and incorporate this important fraud signalinto your business logic.But there's more.An attacker may try to work around App Attestby using a single device to create many App Attest keys,and use that device to serve communicationsbetween many modified apps and your server.To help detect such behavior, we offer a servicecalled the App Attest Risk Metric Servicethat provides the approximate number of keyscreated on a device for your app.Recall that attestKey returns boththe attestation and a risk metric receipt.Your server can submit that receiptto the service and redeem it for a new receipt.The new receipt will include the risk metric.Periodically, you can redeem your latest receiptfor updated metrics for that app/device pair.Here is a high-level view of the receipt structure.It is a PKCS7 container.For full details, see "Assessing Fraud Risk"in the DeviceCheck Framework documentation.App Clips is an exciting feature in iOS.We've added App Attest support to App Clips in iOS 15.To support a seamless upgrade from App Clip to full app,the App Clip and full app share the same app identityin the App Attest context.Make sure to keep this in mindwhen you verify the app identity on your server side.When App Clips are manually removedor expire, their keys will be invalidated,just like when your full app is uninstalled.OK, that's it for App Clips.Now, remember these key points for success with App Attest.Validate on server, not on-device.The app may be modified to disable your validation code.Incorporate a one-time server challenge in your flowto prevent network replay attacks.Handle failure scenarios,such as isSupported returning false,being throttled during ramp up,or general network failures.Incorporate failures as signals in your risk assessment.App Attest and DeviceCheck provide the informationthat you can integrate into your overall fraud assessment.Use DeviceCheck to mitigate fraud on promotional offerings.Take advantage of App Attest to help youdetect modified versions of your app,protecting your content and your user experience.Thanks for watching!I'm looking forward to seeing your appsprotected by App Attest and DeviceCheck.Peace!
