The process of inclusive design

Search this video…♪ ♪Hi. My name is Linda Dong.I'm a Design Evangelist, and I'm going to bejoined shortly by Sam Iglesias,a Prototyper on the Apple Design Team.We're gonna talk about best practices when it comesto designing inclusively.But before we get into that, I wanted to touchon why we make apps and games.As a developer, the things you createbring people joy, enrichment, and convenience.They help us accomplish tasks and reach personal goals.They connect us with other people from around the world.They entertain us through fun gameplayor make us thoughtful through touching narratives.At the end of the day, they add emotionaland practical value to our lives.And I'm sure one of the goals you havefor your app or game is enabling as many people as possibleto enjoy these benefits.Over the years, the App Store has growninto a huge marketplacethat serves 500 million visitors per week.People from over 175 regions around the worldand 40 different languagescan potentially see what you've built.If you want to reach even a fraction of that audience,you owe it to yourself to design with inclusivity in mind,so that your app or game is great for everyone.This means that people can interact with your designthrough different languages and accessibility features.That it's easy to learn, feels natural,and is a pleasure to use.But great usability isn't the only important goal.What also matters is that your app or game iswelcoming and respectful of folksfrom diverse backgrounds and perspectives.Our perspectives are shaped by a number of factors,such as our individual experiences.This could be where we grew up in the worldand where we live now,the cultures we're familiar with,and the languages we speak or hear around us.They're also shaped by our human characteristics,like our gender, our age, and the physical and mentalabilities and disabilities we might have.You can think of each of these factorsas its own diversity axis, and the intersection of wheresomeone lands on all these axes makes up their unique identity.It's a good reminder to think critically abouthow people with completely different identitiesand perspectives will all be able to enjoy what you've built.When someone approaches your app or game,they should feel like you designed with them in mind.Not only will people feel taken care of, you'll build trustthat extends to other areas of your app, game, and brand.One of the great things about beingin your position is that you're in chargeof how accommodating your designs will be for people.It does take work and consideration,and you're not always gonna get it right,but any intentional steps you takewill be appreciated by so many people.To help, we're gonna talk about how to approach designinginclusively, especially in the area of content.At Apple, we define "content" as the words,images, audio, and video that liveinside your designs, as well as your marketing.Content is the language you use to speak to your audience.And it's also how you let folks identify themselves.This can be through the names, profile details,avatars, or characters that people can customizewithin your app or game.The way you address people through your contentand how you let folks represent themselvesare great moments where you can make more people feel welcome.So with that, I'll hand it over to Samto get us started.Thanks, Linda.In this video, we'll go through six specific practicesyou can use to make your app or game more inclusive.Tell diverse stories.Avoid stereotypes.Adopt accessibility.Localize for culture.Use color mindfully.And finally, encourage self-expression.The first practice is tell diverse stories.As Linda mentioned, people who might useyour app or game will come from a rich and diverse setof individual backgrounds and experiences.You have an opportunity to make them feel included,even before they've downloaded it.This could be through something like a web pageor your app's page on the App Store.The way you describe your app or game, its name,video trailer, and even the screenshots you selecttell a story about whom it was built forand how they might use it.If you don't approach this step with creativityand empathy, you might unintentionally makesome potential customers of yours feel unwelcome.Let's focus on app screenshots.You might start with names that are familiarfrom your immediate circle of family and friends.Or depict hobbies and discussionsthat personally interest or excite you.Or draw on familiar storiesfor your app's example scenarios.For example, your app might be social in nature,and you're gonna be making choicesabout what kinds of content shows upin the example feed, who's posting that content,and even the tenor of interactionamong people who use your app.Or it might be something like a to-do list,and you're gonna be making choices about a day in the lifeof somebody using your app:the activity or celebration they might be planning,their reading list, their aspirations.Or it might be a food-tracking app,and you're showing examples of the kinds of foods someonecould be interested in logging, or the kinds of food choicesthey'll be making throughout their day.These are excellent opportunitiesto tell interesting and diverse stories.In my social app, I might wanna depicta group of people having fun on a kayaking trip.While this definitely looks like a lot of fun,this group might not necessarily reflect the diversityof people who might be interested in my app,or a lifestyle that everyone can relate to.There are a number of ways this might be improved.Here's an example of a set of changes we could make.Now, we have a photo that depicts a slightlymore diverse group of people performingan act of community service.In our example to-do app, we might depicta fairly pedestrian day for some Americans,where we're returning a call to our best friend,then shopping for a birthday party,reading a book, and then practicing an instrument.But the problem is these are, at least to some audiences,kind of overly familiar cliches, right?Here's how this example might be improved.Instead of returning John's call,now I'm returning Abhi's call.Instead of shopping for dinner, I'm planning Diwali,a holiday that's observed by over a billion people.For a book, maybe a lesser-known voice, like Chinua Achebe's?As for an activity to practice, how about sign language,which can promote inclusion of the deaf community?While still telling the story of someonewho needs an app to keep track of various tasks,we've made some of the content more relatable and inclusiveto more people along different diversity axes.How about something like a food-logging app?It's probably really tempting, when puttingscreenshots together, to reach for what's familiar.So if you're American, examples like these--pancakes,pizza, hamburgers--might make you feel right at home.But let's remember that not everyone around the world,or even in the United States, imagines a screen like thiswhen they're thinking about food.Adding some foods that might speak to other culturescould be an excellent way to tella slightly different story, not just about how someonemight use your app, but whom your app is for.So when you're setting up your App Store page,tell diverse stories.Fill your screenshots not with the names and scenariosthat come to mind the quickest, but try to dig a little deeper,to find a story that's told less often.Not only will this make new groups of people feel welcomedby your app or game, it'll help it stand out even more.The second practice for designing inclusivelyis to avoid stereotypes.Stereotypes are oversimplified beliefsabout communities of people.They make you overlook differences between individualsand perpetuate incorrect ideas of how people behave.The truth is all of us hold these types of beliefs,and, usually, we're not even aware we have them.But if you aren't careful of how stereotypes influence the designof your app or game, you may be unconsciouslyexcluding people, by not recognizing themin your content and functionality.For example, in your language and visuals,it's sometimes easy to fall into the stereotype that peopleare divided into just two genders, men and women.This binary is deeply embedded in some languages and cultures,and if you're part of those communities,you can unknowingly overlookmillions of people who don't identify with either.Throughout history, people have recognizeda spectrum of human gender, and you canhonor this diversity by avoiding unnecessary referencesto a gender binary in your content.For example, when you don't know someone's gender,instead of using the binary pronouns "he"or "she" in your copy, you can replace this languagewith the gender-neutral pronoun "they" instead.You can also avoid overlooking parts of your audienceby referring to people as a single gender.Like saying "Hey, guys!"in video content, when you can includemore people by saying "Hey, everyone!"Removing unnecessary gender referencesalso applies to visuals.Take, for example, a placeholder icon for someone's new profilethat uses a stereotypical masculine avatar.This icon tells a story about who you thinkyour app is for and maintains a messagethat a generic person means a masculine person.Let's make this better,by using a non-gendered human icon that doesn'tmake any assumptions about who a person is.SFSymbols provides a number of these gender-neutral glyphsyou can use throughout your apps and games.Just as you don't want your app or game to disregardpeople through gender,you also don't want to exclude peopleby unintentionally using ableist language.If you're not familiar with the term "ableism,"it's a stereotype that having a certain set of physicalor mental abilities makes you "normal"and having disabilities makes you "abnormal."But we all know that there's no such thing as normal.Everyone has a unique set of abilities,some people have disabilities,and everyone's capabilities are equally valuable.Like gender, ableist language can be deeply embeddedin the way that we talk and can slip into your copy.Like using words that reference disabilities, such as "insane"or "crazy," to describe something that's undesirable.Even if you're trying to use that wordto describe something positively,like "Achieve insanely fast speeds,"it's still labeling a condition as an outlier,which can stigmatize mental health.In cases like this, you can rethinkhow you can convey the same meaningwithout casting disabilities in a negative or alienating light.Here, instead of saying "Achieve insanely fast speeds,"you could say "Achieve ridiculously fast speeds."Now, all of this isn't to say that you should completelyavoid acknowledging disability in your content,but rather to avoid referring to disabilityin language when suggesting something is less than.In fact, it's a great idea to recognizeand reinforce representation of disabilities.Showing people with disabilities in your emoji,photography, and game characters can helpdebunk stereotypes of who uses and plays apps and games.Outside of content, avoid letting stereotypeslimit your interface's functionality.Let's say I'm designing an app that lets familiesmanage who has access to a shared movie library.If I have a stereotypical view of what a family looks like,perhaps a married man and woman and young children,I might end up designing an interface like this.Which buckets family members into a father,a mother, and child roles.In this case, my app's understandingof what a family is doesn't consider that families can looklike single parents, same-sex parents,multi-generational households,adult children, and legal guardians.Whether I planned it or not, my app's designand functionality excludes all those families who are differentfrom the stereotype from being able to this interface.So how could I improve this feature?Well, instead of assuming there are fixed family roles,I can label each profile something neutral,like "family member."And instead of assuming how many people make up a family,I can start with just the person setting up the account,and let them add as many people to their family as they need.For you, not making assumptions aboutwho is using your app can enable you to buildfunctionality that supports everyone.The best way to develop your awarenessof your own stereotypesis to talk to people from beyond your immediate community.Look for people with a diversity of lived experiences that canhelp you recognize where your knowledge falls short.And remember that language is constantly evolving,and that this guidance will change over time,so be open to updating your knowledge as definitions shift.In our third practice, we'll discuss why it's importantto try to adopt accessibility in your app or game.Imagine someone who is blind has just downloadedyour app, is extremely excited to try it,and is greeted with this from VoiceOver.Button, gear shape two.Or someone who is deaf has made itthrough an exciting level in your gameto a cutscene, and captions aren't offered.Linda told you earlier about ableism,which stems from the idea that somebody who is disabled is"abnormal" and should not receive the same attentionof those who are "normal."If your app or game's content isn't as accessible as possible,it is not inclusive.Do not start with the assumption that someone who isdisabled wouldn't want to use your app or game.Let's look at some ways you can make it benefit more people.The world is a rich tapestry of experiences and abilities.From those who are blind or have low vision,are deaf or hard-of-hearing, have sensitivity to motion,or physical or motor disabilities,hundreds of millions of peopleuse at least one accessibility setting.And even if you or anybody you know doesn't use one,it's possible that at some point in your life, you might findAccessibility helpful, even if temporarily.This can be something temporary like having your pupils dilatedat the optometrist and needing larger text, or needingto reduce exposure to loud sounds after a concussion,or it might be some other health circumstance.So what are some things you can do to ensurethat your app is accessible?Let's have a look at a few things you can do,starting with text and type.Visual perception varies a lot.That's why it's important to make surethat your app functions properly across the rangeof Dynamic Type settings.iOS supports a wide range of text size preferences,but by using the right layout APIs in SwiftUIor UIKit, your app's layout shouldbe able to adapt flexibly and automatically.Here's an example of how a To-Do app usingSwiftUI's font system adapts automatically.Try to take care that your app is intelligibleacross the type size gamut.Look for truncated and clipped text,and maybe rethink some of your layoutsif they have trouble with the larger sizes.Additionally, you wanna make sure that your appconsistently honors some of the settings that UIKit'sor SwiftUI's text system doesn't handle for you automatically.For example, if the person using your app hasBold Text turned on, make sure that elementsthat are not text, but which still might poselegibility challenges, are thickened.These circles, for example.Here's what the app looks like with bold text turned on,but we aren't done yet.We need to go further and have some of our other interfaceelements respond to this new, bolder preference.That's better.Now, let's talk about VoiceOver.VoiceOver is a screen reader that lets people usean interface without looking at the screen.For someone who is blind,VoiceOver is absolutely critical,but VoiceOver also benefits people who have other reasonsnot to look at a screen, such as someone who's ridinga bus, who might be motion sick if they look at their device.By default, VoiceOver attempts to step over interface elementsin a logical order and will glean informationembedded in system-standard controls.However, there will be cases in which VoiceOverneeds more help.The first case is where a button is simplyrepresented by a glyph.If you use a glyph from SFSymbols, VoiceOver will usethe symbol's name, but even a description of the glyph mightnot be enough to convey the button's functionality.Gear shape two, button.Whether you're using SwiftUI or UIKit,take care to add a descriptorthat makes more sense in your app's context.You want VoiceOver to read this button out to saysomething like this.Account settings, button.Or this, where the button is also reflecting some state.Remove favorite, button.The second important note is to pay attentionto VoiceOver's ordering.This app features a prominent "post" button at the bottomof the screen, placed there so it can be easily accessed.But VoiceOver will probably startreading out interface elements on the top left.Fortunately, SwiftUI and UIKit make it easyto specify that the "post" button should be read out first.Make new post, button.And the top left will be read second.Profile picture.Hi there, Enrique!Venice, CA, 68 degrees.You've probably gathered by now that testing is critical.While it's never possible to have complete accessto someone's lived experience, try your app or gamewith some of these Accessibility settings turned on.You can add a number of accessibility settings,like VoiceOver, Increase Contrast, Reduce Transparency,Reduce Motion, and the Grayscale Color Filterinto your Accessibility Shortcut menuand access it from Control Center.Another really handy feature is the Text Size toggle,which can also be added to Control Center.Try experiencing your app or game in grayscaleto get a sense for how reliant you are on colorand how strong your app's color contrast is.Try experiencing your app or game with no sound,to get a sense for how reliant your app is on audio alone.Taking a different perspectiveon how your app or game might be usedcan actually lead to some insights and innovationsthat can make the experience better for everyone.One of my favorite examples is the QuickPath Swipe Keyboard,which was originally inventedto help those who lack the manual dexterityto thumbtype type as quickly as everyone else.As it happens, many people love typing in this way.A solution to a challenge for one group of peopleended up helping many, many more.We didn't touch on all the ways you can makeyour interface more accessible, but be very conscious aboutwho can use your app or game, and try really hard to widenthe circle so that even more people can enjoy your work.Our fourth practice for designing inclusivelyis localizing for culture.A big step in growing your app or game's reachis translating it into different languagesso more people can enjoy it.Even if you're not looking to expandinto other countries just yet,remember that the people who live in your country speakdifferent and, sometimes, multiple languages.In fact, it's estimated that roughly halfthe people in the world speak more than one language.Translation is all about prepping your interfaceso that it can handle different word lengthsand writing systems.It also involves carefully dubbing any audioand translating closed captioning in video.As well as paying attention to how you format units,such as time, phone numbers, and currency.But localization isn't just about translating wordsand numbers from one language to another.It's also about making your contentmore relevant to different cultures.And again, this matters even if you're only focusedon the country you're based in because those folksaround you still come from different cultural backgrounds.One of the first things you can do to make peoplefrom other cultures feel welcome is to double-check whetheryou're using phrases that only make sense to certain people.Take this phrase: "Nine cows and one hair."If you're not familiar with Chinese expressions,you're probably wondering, "What the heck does this mean?"This expression is an idiom, which is a phrase that hasa different meaning than its literal words.If I were to convert this into an English idiom,you might recognize it as "a drop in the bucket,"which, in turn, means "a tiny amount."Language like idioms,and slang, and humor, can be tricky to make inclusive.Not only do they take a lot of stepsin your head to understand, people need to sharethe same cultural background in order to get them.And sometimes, they don't have a direct translation.Imagine if your app's copy said something like"Plan your vacation from A to Z."How would you translate "A to Z," to make sensein, say, Korean?Always try to speak with plain, direct language,avoiding metaphors and complex terms.It will make your copy easier to understand,easier to translate, and more culturally inclusive.In this case, I would rephrase "Plan your vacation from A to Z"plainly as "Plan your vacation from beginning to end."To dive deeper into clear language that's understandableto everyone, check out the new section on "Writing Inclusively"in the Apple Style Guide website.Beyond words, it's good to consider whether your contentis respectful of different cultural norms and customs.Say I've just launched a cooking app in the United States,which compiles recipes for popular mealslike homemade pizza, roast chicken, and hot dogs.My app is doing really well, and I'd like to expandinto international markets, starting with India.I might work closely with a translatorto get my screens written into the language Hindi,which would look like this.If I stopped there and just launched my app in India as-is,it would probably flop in that market.Why?Because even though people in India wouldbe able to read all of the text in my app,my recipe content is still very cateredtowards a U.S. audience.In India, a large portion of the population are vegetarianand follow Hinduism, where cows are revered,and it's very uncommon, sometimes banned, to eat them.Surfacing suggestions like beef and sausagescan come off as insensitive to local cultures.Instead, I could tailor my app's contentto fit with local dietary customs,researching dishes that would be more relevantand ingredients that are more widely available in India.I could also use this opportunityto recognize cultural moments, like surfacing recipestypically eaten during local festivals.Together with translation, acknowledging culturaldifferences gives my app a better chanceof being well-received in a new country.In games, respecting others cultures cancome into play if you have characters and environmentsthat are inspired by real-life people and places.An inclusive game is able to avoidcreating caricatures of different cultures.Ask yourself, "Am I associating an enemyas someone from an already marginalized race?"or "Am I basing 'exotic' alien or fantastical characters"off of the physical traits and languagesof real ethnicities?"Even though you're crafting fictional scenarios,they can still have real impactand hurt players' perceptions of real people and cultures.So take care with how you depict others,and engage in conversations with people from other culturesto learn how you can adapt your contentto better serve and respect them.The fifth practice is to use color mindfully.Linda mentioned earlier that different culturesand languages have idioms that we should be mindful ofwhen we're localizing.The same can apply to color.Colors elicit emotion, and some of those emotionscan change from culture to culture.For example, in many Western countries,green can symbolize environmentalismand going green, or can, in Western countries,come to symbolize luck, money, or fortune.But in a lot of Asian cultures, red is used to connote fortune,happiness, and well-being.This is why it's considered good luck to wear redduring the Lunar New Year.In many parts of the world,red can be associated with love and red roses.Or red can be associatedwith danger, negativity, and even violence.These associations are why, for instance,in most localizations, Stocks shows green for gainsand red for losses, but why, if you setyour region to Mainland China, gains are shown in red.As mentioned earlier, in a lot of Asian cultures,red connotes fortune more strongly than green does.There are probably opportunitiesto customize your colors by region to bemore understandable to a specific culture.As with localizing for culture, the best way to fully understandwhether your color choices are eliciting the intended emotionsis to ask people who come from those backgrounds.Let's also briefly touch back on accessibilityas it relates to color blindness.You might not know that color blindness affects almost 5%of the world's population,so make sure your interface elements don't solely relyon color to get their points across.Here, we have two kinds of dots to indicate "unread"and "flagged."But someone who is colorblind might not be ableto easily distinguish these two kinds of dots from color alone.In such a case, we might need to insteadopt to change one of the dots to a glyph.As a result, you might even end upwith something that is easier to understand at a glance.Also pay attention to contrast ratiosbetween text and backgrounds,particularly when "Increase Contrast" is activated.Not only are some people sensitiveto low-contrast interfaces,there are also environmental factors,like bright sunlight and use of sunglasses,that can also benefit from higher contrast.The default iOS palette actually contains an additional setof colors to support high-contrast mode,so if your app uses system colors,you can automatically benefit from system support.If your app has its own color palette,you're gonna need to calculate the luminosity ratiobetween backgrounds and text, using toolsthat are available on the web or in the App Store.When "Increase Contrast" mode is turned on,aspire to a minimum of 4.5:1 in your interfaces.Plugging these colors in,we find that our contrast doesn't meet the bar of 4.5.What if we try black instead?Now, we can see that we're comfortably over 4.5.In fact, we should probably keep this text color,regardless of whether high-contrast mode is turned on.This is just a rough guide.There will be cases in which this ratio is misleading,and you'll need to use your own judgment.For instance, this color combination also exceeds the barof 4.5, but it's still hard to read in context.Correctly assessing your app or game's contrastis as much of an art as it is a science.Culture is about more than words and symbols;it's about things like color, too.And not everybody perceives the same color palette,so be sure to use color with careso that your app or game can delight everyone.The last practice we wanted to share with youis encourage self-expression.Your app or game can acknowledgeand celebrate people's individuality,and the best way to make that happen is by notlimiting or enforcing how people can identify themselves.Take names, for example.When you meet someone new, "What's your name?"is one of the first things you ask them.It can also be the first thing your app asks forwhen someone launches your experience.And your interface should accept the diversityof names people can have.Very often, names don't pass form validationsbecause they have hyphens or accents,or are shorter or longer than an allowed character count.You might have even experienced this yourself,or can at least understand how annoying it would beto have this happen to you all the time.So to provide a good experience,be flexible in supporting special charactersand not enforcing specific name lengths.Also recognize that concepts like having a first nameand a last name are very region-specific.If you're from Latin America, chances are you havetwo family names, one from each parent.If you're from China, your family name iswritten first and your personal name last.And in some countries, like Malaysia and Afghanistan,you might not have a family name,and go by just your personal name.If you were any of those people, how would you approachthese first and last name input fields?Depending on what you're using their name for,a more culturally-inclusive solution can be to providea single text field for someone to enter their full name.Better yet, you can always ask peoplewhat their preferred name is,which can differ from what they go by legally.Providing this type of flexibility makes surethat all people's names are welcomeand creates a more personal connection if you everaddress someone by name in your app or game later.Similar to names, gender is also an opportunityto acknowledge someone's identity.As I mentioned earlier, human gender is a spectrumand presenting someone with limited optionsto represent their gender, such as Male, Female, and Other,doesn't fully represent how broad that spectrum is.The dating app Bumble is a great exampleof presenting gender choices.At registration, you have the choice to identifyfrom a wide range of gender options and can submit your own.You can also choose to make your genderpublic or private and can change it at any time.An interface like this, that acknowledges diversity,makes more people feel welcome.In games with human character creation screens,how you let people customize themselvesis a great way to acknowledge identity.A lot of times, people craft charactersto look like themselves, so they can feelmore immersed in a role or a story.You can think back to the diversity axesto consider all the ways people might want to physicallyrepresent themselves with different appearances.And if your narrative has a romantic element,you can give people agency to choose relationshipsbased on different sexual orientations.A great example of giving people customization optionsis a game called "Say No! More."Its gameplay is about setting boundariesat work by saying the word "No!"as a super power.When you create your character, there's a wide varietyof ages, skin colors, body types,hairstyles, and clothing to choose from.You also can choose how you say "No!"based on a number of languages and vocal tones.Better yet, none of your choicesare bucketed by what gender your character is.In fact, the game never asks for your genderbecause it doesn't need to.Clothing and hair styles don't belong to a certain gender,and neither does how someone's voice sounds.In this case, not asking for you to identifymakes this game's interface more inclusive.Always prioritize asking people how they'd liketo represent themselves through your app or game,and design flexible interfaces that respect those identities.So we've covered a lot in this video.The importance of thinking carefully about howyou craft the stories around your app.Tell diverse stories.Avoiding stereotypes in your language and content.Making sure that you are taking advantageof the accessibility featuresoffered on our platforms and testing accordingly.That your app is thoughtfully localized and sensitiveto how culture can affect how content is carried over.That your app mindfully uses color, both to respect cultureand those who perceive color differently.And lastly, that your app doesn't unduly restrictsomeone's ability to identify how they want to.These practices stem from our duty to each otherto design inclusivelyand to help each person live their best life.Inclusive design is welcoming and respectful,and inclusive design is great for everyone.These practices take, well, practice to get right.And while this might seem like a lot to do, it's worth it.Because when we craft something with respect,consideration, and love, that care can be felt.For more resources on how you candesign inclusively, check out our new sectionon "Inclusion" in the Human Interface Guidelines.And on how you can instill inclusive principlesdeep into your process, watch the talk,"The process of inclusive design."Thanks.

♪ ♪Hi. My name is Linda Dong.I'm a Design Evangelist, and I'm going to bejoined shortly by Sam Iglesias,a Prototyper on the Apple Design Team.We're gonna talk about best practices when it comesto designing inclusively.But before we get into that, I wanted to touchon why we make apps and games.As a developer, the things you createbring people joy, enrichment, and convenience.They help us accomplish tasks and reach personal goals.They connect us with other people from around the world.They entertain us through fun gameplayor make us thoughtful through touching narratives.At the end of the day, they add emotionaland practical value to our lives.And I'm sure one of the goals you havefor your app or game is enabling as many people as possibleto enjoy these benefits.Over the years, the App Store has growninto a huge marketplacethat serves 500 million visitors per week.People from over 175 regions around the worldand 40 different languagescan potentially see what you've built.If you want to reach even a fraction of that audience,you owe it to yourself to design with inclusivity in mind,so that your app or game is great for everyone.This means that people can interact with your designthrough different languages and accessibility features.That it's easy to learn, feels natural,and is a pleasure to use.But great usability isn't the only important goal.What also matters is that your app or game iswelcoming and respectful of folksfrom diverse backgrounds and perspectives.Our perspectives are shaped by a number of factors,such as our individual experiences.This could be where we grew up in the worldand where we live now,the cultures we're familiar with,and the languages we speak or hear around us.They're also shaped by our human characteristics,like our gender, our age, and the physical and mentalabilities and disabilities we might have.You can think of each of these factorsas its own diversity axis, and the intersection of wheresomeone lands on all these axes makes up their unique identity.It's a good reminder to think critically abouthow people with completely different identitiesand perspectives will all be able to enjoy what you've built.When someone approaches your app or game,they should feel like you designed with them in mind.Not only will people feel taken care of, you'll build trustthat extends to other areas of your app, game, and brand.One of the great things about beingin your position is that you're in chargeof how accommodating your designs will be for people.It does take work and consideration,and you're not always gonna get it right,but any intentional steps you takewill be appreciated by so many people.

To help, we're gonna talk about how to approach designinginclusively, especially in the area of content.At Apple, we define "content" as the words,images, audio, and video that liveinside your designs, as well as your marketing.Content is the language you use to speak to your audience.And it's also how you let folks identify themselves.This can be through the names, profile details,avatars, or characters that people can customizewithin your app or game.The way you address people through your contentand how you let folks represent themselvesare great moments where you can make more people feel welcome.So with that, I'll hand it over to Samto get us started.Thanks, Linda.In this video, we'll go through six specific practicesyou can use to make your app or game more inclusive.

Tell diverse stories.Avoid stereotypes.Adopt accessibility.Localize for culture.Use color mindfully.And finally, encourage self-expression.The first practice is tell diverse stories.As Linda mentioned, people who might useyour app or game will come from a rich and diverse setof individual backgrounds and experiences.You have an opportunity to make them feel included,even before they've downloaded it.This could be through something like a web pageor your app's page on the App Store.

The way you describe your app or game, its name,video trailer, and even the screenshots you selecttell a story about whom it was built forand how they might use it.If you don't approach this step with creativityand empathy, you might unintentionally makesome potential customers of yours feel unwelcome.Let's focus on app screenshots.You might start with names that are familiarfrom your immediate circle of family and friends.Or depict hobbies and discussionsthat personally interest or excite you.Or draw on familiar storiesfor your app's example scenarios.For example, your app might be social in nature,and you're gonna be making choicesabout what kinds of content shows upin the example feed, who's posting that content,and even the tenor of interactionamong people who use your app.Or it might be something like a to-do list,and you're gonna be making choices about a day in the lifeof somebody using your app:the activity or celebration they might be planning,their reading list, their aspirations.Or it might be a food-tracking app,and you're showing examples of the kinds of foods someonecould be interested in logging, or the kinds of food choicesthey'll be making throughout their day.These are excellent opportunitiesto tell interesting and diverse stories.In my social app, I might wanna depicta group of people having fun on a kayaking trip.While this definitely looks like a lot of fun,this group might not necessarily reflect the diversityof people who might be interested in my app,or a lifestyle that everyone can relate to.There are a number of ways this might be improved.

Here's an example of a set of changes we could make.Now, we have a photo that depicts a slightlymore diverse group of people performingan act of community service.

In our example to-do app, we might depicta fairly pedestrian day for some Americans,where we're returning a call to our best friend,then shopping for a birthday party,reading a book, and then practicing an instrument.But the problem is these are, at least to some audiences,kind of overly familiar cliches, right?Here's how this example might be improved.Instead of returning John's call,now I'm returning Abhi's call.Instead of shopping for dinner, I'm planning Diwali,a holiday that's observed by over a billion people.For a book, maybe a lesser-known voice, like Chinua Achebe's?As for an activity to practice, how about sign language,which can promote inclusion of the deaf community?While still telling the story of someonewho needs an app to keep track of various tasks,we've made some of the content more relatable and inclusiveto more people along different diversity axes.

How about something like a food-logging app?It's probably really tempting, when puttingscreenshots together, to reach for what's familiar.So if you're American, examples like these--pancakes,pizza, hamburgers--might make you feel right at home.But let's remember that not everyone around the world,or even in the United States, imagines a screen like thiswhen they're thinking about food.Adding some foods that might speak to other culturescould be an excellent way to tella slightly different story, not just about how someonemight use your app, but whom your app is for.So when you're setting up your App Store page,tell diverse stories.Fill your screenshots not with the names and scenariosthat come to mind the quickest, but try to dig a little deeper,to find a story that's told less often.Not only will this make new groups of people feel welcomedby your app or game, it'll help it stand out even more.

The second practice for designing inclusivelyis to avoid stereotypes.Stereotypes are oversimplified beliefsabout communities of people.They make you overlook differences between individualsand perpetuate incorrect ideas of how people behave.The truth is all of us hold these types of beliefs,and, usually, we're not even aware we have them.But if you aren't careful of how stereotypes influence the designof your app or game, you may be unconsciouslyexcluding people, by not recognizing themin your content and functionality.For example, in your language and visuals,it's sometimes easy to fall into the stereotype that peopleare divided into just two genders, men and women.This binary is deeply embedded in some languages and cultures,and if you're part of those communities,you can unknowingly overlookmillions of people who don't identify with either.

Throughout history, people have recognizeda spectrum of human gender, and you canhonor this diversity by avoiding unnecessary referencesto a gender binary in your content.For example, when you don't know someone's gender,instead of using the binary pronouns "he"or "she" in your copy, you can replace this languagewith the gender-neutral pronoun "they" instead.

You can also avoid overlooking parts of your audienceby referring to people as a single gender.Like saying "Hey, guys!"in video content, when you can includemore people by saying "Hey, everyone!"Removing unnecessary gender referencesalso applies to visuals.Take, for example, a placeholder icon for someone's new profilethat uses a stereotypical masculine avatar.This icon tells a story about who you thinkyour app is for and maintains a messagethat a generic person means a masculine person.

Let's make this better,by using a non-gendered human icon that doesn'tmake any assumptions about who a person is.

SFSymbols provides a number of these gender-neutral glyphsyou can use throughout your apps and games.Just as you don't want your app or game to disregardpeople through gender,you also don't want to exclude peopleby unintentionally using ableist language.

If you're not familiar with the term "ableism,"it's a stereotype that having a certain set of physicalor mental abilities makes you "normal"and having disabilities makes you "abnormal."But we all know that there's no such thing as normal.Everyone has a unique set of abilities,some people have disabilities,and everyone's capabilities are equally valuable.

Like gender, ableist language can be deeply embeddedin the way that we talk and can slip into your copy.Like using words that reference disabilities, such as "insane"or "crazy," to describe something that's undesirable.Even if you're trying to use that wordto describe something positively,like "Achieve insanely fast speeds,"it's still labeling a condition as an outlier,which can stigmatize mental health.In cases like this, you can rethinkhow you can convey the same meaningwithout casting disabilities in a negative or alienating light.

Here, instead of saying "Achieve insanely fast speeds,"you could say "Achieve ridiculously fast speeds."Now, all of this isn't to say that you should completelyavoid acknowledging disability in your content,but rather to avoid referring to disabilityin language when suggesting something is less than.In fact, it's a great idea to recognizeand reinforce representation of disabilities.Showing people with disabilities in your emoji,photography, and game characters can helpdebunk stereotypes of who uses and plays apps and games.Outside of content, avoid letting stereotypeslimit your interface's functionality.Let's say I'm designing an app that lets familiesmanage who has access to a shared movie library.If I have a stereotypical view of what a family looks like,perhaps a married man and woman and young children,I might end up designing an interface like this.Which buckets family members into a father,a mother, and child roles.In this case, my app's understandingof what a family is doesn't consider that families can looklike single parents, same-sex parents,multi-generational households,adult children, and legal guardians.Whether I planned it or not, my app's designand functionality excludes all those families who are differentfrom the stereotype from being able to this interface.So how could I improve this feature?Well, instead of assuming there are fixed family roles,I can label each profile something neutral,like "family member."And instead of assuming how many people make up a family,I can start with just the person setting up the account,and let them add as many people to their family as they need.For you, not making assumptions aboutwho is using your app can enable you to buildfunctionality that supports everyone.The best way to develop your awarenessof your own stereotypesis to talk to people from beyond your immediate community.Look for people with a diversity of lived experiences that canhelp you recognize where your knowledge falls short.And remember that language is constantly evolving,and that this guidance will change over time,so be open to updating your knowledge as definitions shift.

In our third practice, we'll discuss why it's importantto try to adopt accessibility in your app or game.Imagine someone who is blind has just downloadedyour app, is extremely excited to try it,and is greeted with this from VoiceOver.Button, gear shape two.Or someone who is deaf has made itthrough an exciting level in your gameto a cutscene, and captions aren't offered.Linda told you earlier about ableism,which stems from the idea that somebody who is disabled is"abnormal" and should not receive the same attentionof those who are "normal."If your app or game's content isn't as accessible as possible,it is not inclusive.Do not start with the assumption that someone who isdisabled wouldn't want to use your app or game.Let's look at some ways you can make it benefit more people.

The world is a rich tapestry of experiences and abilities.From those who are blind or have low vision,are deaf or hard-of-hearing, have sensitivity to motion,or physical or motor disabilities,hundreds of millions of peopleuse at least one accessibility setting.And even if you or anybody you know doesn't use one,it's possible that at some point in your life, you might findAccessibility helpful, even if temporarily.This can be something temporary like having your pupils dilatedat the optometrist and needing larger text, or needingto reduce exposure to loud sounds after a concussion,or it might be some other health circumstance.So what are some things you can do to ensurethat your app is accessible?Let's have a look at a few things you can do,starting with text and type.Visual perception varies a lot.That's why it's important to make surethat your app functions properly across the rangeof Dynamic Type settings.iOS supports a wide range of text size preferences,but by using the right layout APIs in SwiftUIor UIKit, your app's layout shouldbe able to adapt flexibly and automatically.Here's an example of how a To-Do app usingSwiftUI's font system adapts automatically.Try to take care that your app is intelligibleacross the type size gamut.Look for truncated and clipped text,and maybe rethink some of your layoutsif they have trouble with the larger sizes.Additionally, you wanna make sure that your appconsistently honors some of the settings that UIKit'sor SwiftUI's text system doesn't handle for you automatically.For example, if the person using your app hasBold Text turned on, make sure that elementsthat are not text, but which still might poselegibility challenges, are thickened.These circles, for example.Here's what the app looks like with bold text turned on,but we aren't done yet.We need to go further and have some of our other interfaceelements respond to this new, bolder preference.That's better.Now, let's talk about VoiceOver.VoiceOver is a screen reader that lets people usean interface without looking at the screen.For someone who is blind,VoiceOver is absolutely critical,but VoiceOver also benefits people who have other reasonsnot to look at a screen, such as someone who's ridinga bus, who might be motion sick if they look at their device.By default, VoiceOver attempts to step over interface elementsin a logical order and will glean informationembedded in system-standard controls.

However, there will be cases in which VoiceOverneeds more help.

The first case is where a button is simplyrepresented by a glyph.If you use a glyph from SFSymbols, VoiceOver will usethe symbol's name, but even a description of the glyph mightnot be enough to convey the button's functionality.Gear shape two, button.Whether you're using SwiftUI or UIKit,take care to add a descriptorthat makes more sense in your app's context.You want VoiceOver to read this button out to saysomething like this.Account settings, button.Or this, where the button is also reflecting some state.Remove favorite, button.The second important note is to pay attentionto VoiceOver's ordering.This app features a prominent "post" button at the bottomof the screen, placed there so it can be easily accessed.But VoiceOver will probably startreading out interface elements on the top left.Fortunately, SwiftUI and UIKit make it easyto specify that the "post" button should be read out first.Make new post, button.And the top left will be read second.Profile picture.Hi there, Enrique!Venice, CA, 68 degrees.

You've probably gathered by now that testing is critical.

While it's never possible to have complete accessto someone's lived experience, try your app or gamewith some of these Accessibility settings turned on.

You can add a number of accessibility settings,like VoiceOver, Increase Contrast, Reduce Transparency,Reduce Motion, and the Grayscale Color Filterinto your Accessibility Shortcut menuand access it from Control Center.Another really handy feature is the Text Size toggle,which can also be added to Control Center.Try experiencing your app or game in grayscaleto get a sense for how reliant you are on colorand how strong your app's color contrast is.Try experiencing your app or game with no sound,to get a sense for how reliant your app is on audio alone.Taking a different perspectiveon how your app or game might be usedcan actually lead to some insights and innovationsthat can make the experience better for everyone.One of my favorite examples is the QuickPath Swipe Keyboard,which was originally inventedto help those who lack the manual dexterityto thumbtype type as quickly as everyone else.As it happens, many people love typing in this way.A solution to a challenge for one group of peopleended up helping many, many more.We didn't touch on all the ways you can makeyour interface more accessible, but be very conscious aboutwho can use your app or game, and try really hard to widenthe circle so that even more people can enjoy your work.Our fourth practice for designing inclusivelyis localizing for culture.A big step in growing your app or game's reachis translating it into different languagesso more people can enjoy it.Even if you're not looking to expandinto other countries just yet,remember that the people who live in your country speakdifferent and, sometimes, multiple languages.In fact, it's estimated that roughly halfthe people in the world speak more than one language.Translation is all about prepping your interfaceso that it can handle different word lengthsand writing systems.It also involves carefully dubbing any audioand translating closed captioning in video.As well as paying attention to how you format units,such as time, phone numbers, and currency.

But localization isn't just about translating wordsand numbers from one language to another.It's also about making your contentmore relevant to different cultures.And again, this matters even if you're only focusedon the country you're based in because those folksaround you still come from different cultural backgrounds.One of the first things you can do to make peoplefrom other cultures feel welcome is to double-check whetheryou're using phrases that only make sense to certain people.

Take this phrase: "Nine cows and one hair."If you're not familiar with Chinese expressions,you're probably wondering, "What the heck does this mean?"This expression is an idiom, which is a phrase that hasa different meaning than its literal words.If I were to convert this into an English idiom,you might recognize it as "a drop in the bucket,"which, in turn, means "a tiny amount."Language like idioms,and slang, and humor, can be tricky to make inclusive.Not only do they take a lot of stepsin your head to understand, people need to sharethe same cultural background in order to get them.And sometimes, they don't have a direct translation.

Imagine if your app's copy said something like"Plan your vacation from A to Z."How would you translate "A to Z," to make sensein, say, Korean?Always try to speak with plain, direct language,avoiding metaphors and complex terms.It will make your copy easier to understand,easier to translate, and more culturally inclusive.

In this case, I would rephrase "Plan your vacation from A to Z"plainly as "Plan your vacation from beginning to end."To dive deeper into clear language that's understandableto everyone, check out the new section on "Writing Inclusively"in the Apple Style Guide website.Beyond words, it's good to consider whether your contentis respectful of different cultural norms and customs.

Say I've just launched a cooking app in the United States,which compiles recipes for popular mealslike homemade pizza, roast chicken, and hot dogs.My app is doing really well, and I'd like to expandinto international markets, starting with India.

I might work closely with a translatorto get my screens written into the language Hindi,which would look like this.If I stopped there and just launched my app in India as-is,it would probably flop in that market.Why?Because even though people in India wouldbe able to read all of the text in my app,my recipe content is still very cateredtowards a U.S. audience.

In India, a large portion of the population are vegetarianand follow Hinduism, where cows are revered,and it's very uncommon, sometimes banned, to eat them.Surfacing suggestions like beef and sausagescan come off as insensitive to local cultures.Instead, I could tailor my app's contentto fit with local dietary customs,researching dishes that would be more relevantand ingredients that are more widely available in India.I could also use this opportunityto recognize cultural moments, like surfacing recipestypically eaten during local festivals.

Together with translation, acknowledging culturaldifferences gives my app a better chanceof being well-received in a new country.In games, respecting others cultures cancome into play if you have characters and environmentsthat are inspired by real-life people and places.

An inclusive game is able to avoidcreating caricatures of different cultures.Ask yourself, "Am I associating an enemyas someone from an already marginalized race?"or "Am I basing 'exotic' alien or fantastical characters"off of the physical traits and languagesof real ethnicities?"Even though you're crafting fictional scenarios,they can still have real impactand hurt players' perceptions of real people and cultures.So take care with how you depict others,and engage in conversations with people from other culturesto learn how you can adapt your contentto better serve and respect them.The fifth practice is to use color mindfully.Linda mentioned earlier that different culturesand languages have idioms that we should be mindful ofwhen we're localizing.The same can apply to color.Colors elicit emotion, and some of those emotionscan change from culture to culture.For example, in many Western countries,green can symbolize environmentalismand going green, or can, in Western countries,come to symbolize luck, money, or fortune.But in a lot of Asian cultures, red is used to connote fortune,happiness, and well-being.This is why it's considered good luck to wear redduring the Lunar New Year.In many parts of the world,red can be associated with love and red roses.Or red can be associatedwith danger, negativity, and even violence.

These associations are why, for instance,in most localizations, Stocks shows green for gainsand red for losses, but why, if you setyour region to Mainland China, gains are shown in red.

As mentioned earlier, in a lot of Asian cultures,red connotes fortune more strongly than green does.There are probably opportunitiesto customize your colors by region to bemore understandable to a specific culture.As with localizing for culture, the best way to fully understandwhether your color choices are eliciting the intended emotionsis to ask people who come from those backgrounds.

Let's also briefly touch back on accessibilityas it relates to color blindness.You might not know that color blindness affects almost 5%of the world's population,so make sure your interface elements don't solely relyon color to get their points across.Here, we have two kinds of dots to indicate "unread"and "flagged."But someone who is colorblind might not be ableto easily distinguish these two kinds of dots from color alone.

In such a case, we might need to insteadopt to change one of the dots to a glyph.As a result, you might even end upwith something that is easier to understand at a glance.Also pay attention to contrast ratiosbetween text and backgrounds,particularly when "Increase Contrast" is activated.Not only are some people sensitiveto low-contrast interfaces,there are also environmental factors,like bright sunlight and use of sunglasses,that can also benefit from higher contrast.

The default iOS palette actually contains an additional setof colors to support high-contrast mode,so if your app uses system colors,you can automatically benefit from system support.If your app has its own color palette,you're gonna need to calculate the luminosity ratiobetween backgrounds and text, using toolsthat are available on the web or in the App Store.

When "Increase Contrast" mode is turned on,aspire to a minimum of 4.5:1 in your interfaces.

Plugging these colors in,we find that our contrast doesn't meet the bar of 4.5.What if we try black instead?Now, we can see that we're comfortably over 4.5.In fact, we should probably keep this text color,regardless of whether high-contrast mode is turned on.This is just a rough guide.There will be cases in which this ratio is misleading,and you'll need to use your own judgment.

For instance, this color combination also exceeds the barof 4.5, but it's still hard to read in context.

Correctly assessing your app or game's contrastis as much of an art as it is a science.Culture is about more than words and symbols;it's about things like color, too.And not everybody perceives the same color palette,so be sure to use color with careso that your app or game can delight everyone.

The last practice we wanted to share with youis encourage self-expression.Your app or game can acknowledgeand celebrate people's individuality,and the best way to make that happen is by notlimiting or enforcing how people can identify themselves.

Take names, for example.When you meet someone new, "What's your name?"is one of the first things you ask them.

It can also be the first thing your app asks forwhen someone launches your experience.And your interface should accept the diversityof names people can have.Very often, names don't pass form validationsbecause they have hyphens or accents,or are shorter or longer than an allowed character count.You might have even experienced this yourself,or can at least understand how annoying it would beto have this happen to you all the time.

So to provide a good experience,be flexible in supporting special charactersand not enforcing specific name lengths.

Also recognize that concepts like having a first nameand a last name are very region-specific.

If you're from Latin America, chances are you havetwo family names, one from each parent.

If you're from China, your family name iswritten first and your personal name last.

And in some countries, like Malaysia and Afghanistan,you might not have a family name,and go by just your personal name.If you were any of those people, how would you approachthese first and last name input fields?Depending on what you're using their name for,a more culturally-inclusive solution can be to providea single text field for someone to enter their full name.Better yet, you can always ask peoplewhat their preferred name is,which can differ from what they go by legally.Providing this type of flexibility makes surethat all people's names are welcomeand creates a more personal connection if you everaddress someone by name in your app or game later.Similar to names, gender is also an opportunityto acknowledge someone's identity.As I mentioned earlier, human gender is a spectrumand presenting someone with limited optionsto represent their gender, such as Male, Female, and Other,doesn't fully represent how broad that spectrum is.

The dating app Bumble is a great exampleof presenting gender choices.At registration, you have the choice to identifyfrom a wide range of gender options and can submit your own.You can also choose to make your genderpublic or private and can change it at any time.An interface like this, that acknowledges diversity,makes more people feel welcome.

In games with human character creation screens,how you let people customize themselvesis a great way to acknowledge identity.A lot of times, people craft charactersto look like themselves, so they can feelmore immersed in a role or a story.

You can think back to the diversity axesto consider all the ways people might want to physicallyrepresent themselves with different appearances.And if your narrative has a romantic element,you can give people agency to choose relationshipsbased on different sexual orientations.

A great example of giving people customization optionsis a game called "Say No! More."Its gameplay is about setting boundariesat work by saying the word "No!"as a super power.

When you create your character, there's a wide varietyof ages, skin colors, body types,hairstyles, and clothing to choose from.

You also can choose how you say "No!"based on a number of languages and vocal tones.Better yet, none of your choicesare bucketed by what gender your character is.In fact, the game never asks for your genderbecause it doesn't need to.Clothing and hair styles don't belong to a certain gender,and neither does how someone's voice sounds.In this case, not asking for you to identifymakes this game's interface more inclusive.

Always prioritize asking people how they'd liketo represent themselves through your app or game,and design flexible interfaces that respect those identities.

So we've covered a lot in this video.The importance of thinking carefully about howyou craft the stories around your app.Tell diverse stories.Avoiding stereotypes in your language and content.

Making sure that you are taking advantageof the accessibility featuresoffered on our platforms and testing accordingly.That your app is thoughtfully localized and sensitiveto how culture can affect how content is carried over.That your app mindfully uses color, both to respect cultureand those who perceive color differently.And lastly, that your app doesn't unduly restrictsomeone's ability to identify how they want to.These practices stem from our duty to each otherto design inclusivelyand to help each person live their best life.

Inclusive design is welcoming and respectful,and inclusive design is great for everyone.

These practices take, well, practice to get right.And while this might seem like a lot to do, it's worth it.Because when we craft something with respect,consideration, and love, that care can be felt.
