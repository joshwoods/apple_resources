television.Depending on the market that you're in,your users might actually prefer free ad-supported contentover ad-free content that they need to pay for.So if you're interested in including adsand other interstitials in your HLS streams,you've tuned in to the right session.Before we dive in, let's quickly reviewsome of the existing mechanismsfor inserting ads in HLS streams.You could perform server side ad insertionusing DISCONTINUITY tags.This is a fairly static scheme in that the ad segmentsare stitched together with the content segments,and this stitching has to be doneeven before the playlist is vended to the user.As you might imagine, this doesn't allowfor late binding of your ad assetswhere you'd like for an ad to be decisionedas the user is approaching the ad markeror even rebinding, say, when a user navigatesto a portion of the video that they've already watched,they're going to see the same ad all over again.Since HLS operates at a segment granularity,transitions to and from ad podsneed to happen at segment boundaries.If your ad marker happens to be presentin the middle a content segment,you'd have to split up that segmentin order to stitch in the ad.Oftentimes, the number of quality tiers would be differentbetween your primary and interstitial assets.In order to stitch the ad togetherwith all the primary quality tiers,the ads would need to be conditionedto match the content encoding.And you'd also want to make sure that the ads usethe same codecs as the primary content.And in live streaming scenarios, your packager mighthave to do a lot of back-end bookkeeping.Your ads and interstitials would mostly bevideo-on-demand streams.But the packager would have to spool these outon a per-segment basisfor the entirety of the ad break.You could also insert ads on the client side.Until now, we didn't have an official recommendationon how this can be done.One of the more popular approachesis to use a two-player schemewhere one player would present the primary contentwhile the other would present the interstitials.And transitions are achieved by coordinating playbackbetween the two players and by managingplayer view hierarchies.While this works well,the issues here are mostly on the performance side.If buffering is not properly coordinatedbetween the two players,pre-fetching your ad would impactthe adaptive bit rate performanceof the primary content stream.And features like Picture in Picture and AirPlayare really hard to do wellwith these custom player approaches.This year, we've addressed all these concernsand in general attempted to make ad insertiona lot more simple.We're introducing HLS interstitialswhere ads are treated as separate assetsthat can be scheduled onto a program timeline.Ads are no longer stitched in with DISCONTINUITY tags.Instead they remain as self-contained assetsthat can be referenced via their master playlist.As we'll soon see, this scheme is dynamic,allowing for late bindingand even rebinding to your ad inventory.You're no longer constrained to segment boundaries.You could arbitrarily place ads anywhereon the program timeline.HLS interstitials in conjunction with AVKitoffers built-in support for navigation restrictionson tvOS.We also have built-in support for AirPlayand Picture in Picture.All your scheduled ads and interstitials will becarried over the AirPlay session.We also coordinate bufferingand the use of other system resourcesbetween the primary and interstitial playersso as to achieve seamless transitions.Now let's take a look at a typical playback flowwhen we present some video-on-demand contentalong with ads using HLS interstitials.The blue bar in this picture represents your main content,and the orange and green barsare the ads that you'd like to schedule during playback.Now, the primary would play up until the ad marker,at which point it would pause,and the first ad would start playing.Once the first ad plays out,the second ad would immediately follow.After the second ad, the primary would resumefrom where it left off.Now let's take a look at the buffering sequence.We start by buffering the primaryup until the start time of the first ad.Now we'd pre-buffer the first ad,making it possible to achieve a smooth transition.After this has completely buffered,we'd pre-buffer the second ad.And after the second ad has completely buffered,we'd start buffering the primary againso that we switch back seamlessly.The playback flow for live scenarios is similar,except that we'd rejoin the primaryafter jumping forward by the ad duration.This is so that we remain in sync with the live edge.And this also adopts a similar buffering strategysuch that seamless transitions are possible.So how would you schedule ads with HLS interstitials?You can now do server side ad insertion using DATERANGE tags.For this, we're introducing a new date range classwith attributes.This playlist is carrying timing informationthrough a PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag.These tags are now mandatorysince the ad schedule is now specified using dates.Here we see an ad lined up using the DATERANGE tag,with the class set to com.apple.hls.interstitial.The ID attribute uniquely identifies the event.START-DATE is where you'd like for the adto start in the primary timeline.Here we see that the ad is scheduledat 5 seconds into playback.The DURATION attribute specifies the duration of the ad.The X-ASSET-URI attribute specifies the URIof the ad's master playlist.And the X-RESUME-OFFSET attribute specifies the offsetfrom the START-DATE, where you'd like primary playback to resume.A resume offset of 0 would meanthat the primary would resume from where it left off.If the resume offset attribute is absent,we'd rejoin the primary at an offsetwhich equals the ad duration.This is probably what you'd want to do for live scenarios.Sometimes you might wish to skip over in-stream adsas shown here.For that, you'd simply specify the resume offsetto be the duration of the in-stream ad.You can schedule multiple ads using DATERANGE tags.Here we see the first ad scheduledat 5 seconds into the primaryand the second one at 10 seconds.You can schedule back-to-back adssimply by specifying the same start time for each of them.Here we see that the first ad startsat 5 seconds into playback, and so does the second.The ads would be displayed in the orderthat they appear in the playlist.These approaches where you use the X-ASSET-URI attributeto reference your ad would require youto define your ad pod when you're addingthe DATERANGE tag to the playlist.But you could defer that decisionusing the X-ASSET-LIST attribute.The X-ASSET-LIST points to a JSON objectthat contains the event schedule.The object has an ASSETS array that specifiesthe list of interstitials, with each entry specifyingthe URI of the master playlist and the duration.Note that this JSON object would be fetchedonly at buffering time,allowing for late binding to your ad inventory.Usually, ads would play out fully to the end.However, you can specify an end timefor your ad using the X-PLAYOUT-LIMIT attribute.You can use this attribute to implementearly return scenarios in live broadcasts.An early return is where you'd like to interruptyour ad break in order to return to the live feed.This could be due to a breaking news scenario,or maybe there was some sudden excitement on the sports fieldthat you don't want your viewers to miss out on.So how would you use this to implement early return?Here we have a live playlist that contains six segments.The live edge is at the end of segment six.Now the playhead would usually bethree target durations behind the live edge.In this case, it's at the end of segment three.At this point, a 15-second ad spotis decisioned to follow segment six.So the playlist update actually contains all six segmentsalong with a DATERANGE tag carrying the ad schedule.In the next update, the playhead would've movedto the end of segment four,and the ad is still scheduled to follow segment six.The shaded segment seven here simply represents the ad break.In the following update, the playhead has movedto the end of segment five, and in the next update,we're at the beginning of the ad break.If you don't do anything, the ad would play out for 15 seconds.But if you want to schedule an early return,say, after 12 seconds, you'd simply specifythe play-out limit to be that.Now your ad would play for 12 secondsbefore returning to the program.Oftentimes for contractual reasons,you'd want to prevent your userfrom jumping over or skipping through the ads.You can specify navigation restrictionsusing the X-RESTRICT attribute.X-RESTRICT with a value jump would prevent a user to seekfrom a time before the ad to a time after the ad.An X-RESTRICT with a value skip would prevent onefrom playing the ad at a rate different from what is desired.Note that these restrictions are enforced by the UI.On tvOS, they're enforced by AVKit.And they should be available to you if you usethe AVPlayerViewController for your video presentation.When you're on other platforms or if you're not using AVKit,it's up to your application to enforce these restrictions.Now that we've seen how you could scheduleserver side ads using DATERANGE tags,let's see how you can monitor their progress at the client.For this, we're introducing two new AVFoundation objects:the AVPlayerInterstitialEventMonitorthat notifies the client when an interstitialis scheduled or playingand the AVPlayerInterstitialEvent objectwhich contains all the information necessaryto place ads on a player item's timeline.The AVPlayerInterstitialEventMonitorhas the following properties:a primary player that is playing your primary asset,a handle to the interstitial playerthat you can use to monitor playback of the ads,an events array which is an arrayof AVPlayerInterstitialEvent objects that representthe different interstitials set on the player.We'll get to the descriptionof the AVPlayerInterstitialEvent object shortly.A handle to the currentEvent.So this would be valid when an interstitialis playing and null otherwise.And then we have the eventsDidChangeNotificationwhich would fire when the event schedule changes,and finally the currentEvent- DidChangeNotificationwhich would fire when we transitionto and from interstitials.The AVPlayerInterstitialEvent object that describesan interstitial event has properties that are basicallyanalogues of the DATERANGE attributes that we saw earlier.The primaryItem represents your primary asseton whose timeline you'd like to schedule the interstitials.The identifier is similar to the ID attributeand this uniquely identifies the event.The time and date fields specify the start timeof the interstitial in media time and date respectively.This would be like the START-DATE attribute.We'd use a copy of the template items to createthe interstitial player items that'd represent your ad pod.So this is similar to the ASSET-LIST attributethat we saw earlier.The restrictions property would specifythe navigation restrictions for your interstitials.Then we have the resumptionOffsetand playoutLimit properties that are similarto their DATERANGE counterparts.And finally we have a dictionary of userDefinedAttributes.So you can specify custom attributesin the DATERANGE tag,and these would be surfaced to your client applicationthrough the userDefinedAttributes property.For instance, you might include a beacon URLand other custom attributesfor reporting ad playback metrics.Here's some example code that shows how you might usethese APIs to update your UI when an interstitial is playing.You create an AVPlayer to play your primary content.So this content has interstitials scheduledusing the DATERANGE tags.And then create an AVPlayerInterstitialEventMonitorand set it on the player.You then subscribeto the currentEvent- DidChangeNotificationto inform your application when the player transitionsin and out of interstitials.And when that notification fires,you simply update your UI.Sometimes you might want to schedule adson the client side. For that, we're introducingthe AVPlayer- InterstitialEventControllerthat lets you programmatically set events on an AVPlayer.This object inherits from the AVPlayerInterstitialEventMonitorand so has a lot of properties in common.One thing to note is that whilethe events property is read-only at the monitor,it is a read-write property at the controller,thus letting you programatically schedule events.And this also has the cancelCurrentEvent APIthat lets you cancelthe currently playing interstitial.In this sample, we see how one might schedulean ad pod containing two ads on an AVPlayer.You create an AVPlayer to play your primary asset.You then create an AVPlayer- InterstitialEventControllerand set it on the AVPlayer.You create an array of AVPlayer itemsthat represent your ad pod.Then create an AVPlayerInterstitialEventobject where you specifythe primaryItem to be the player's current item,as this represents your movie asset,the start time in this example,some 10 seconds into playback,and the templateItems to be the ad podthat we created earlier.And after the object is created, you simply set iton the events property of the controller.You might notice that just before we setthe player on the AVPlayerViewController,we set the currentItem.translates-PlayerInterstitialEvents property to true.When this is set, AVKit would place navigation markerson the timeline and also enforce navigation restrictions on tvOS.Now let's cut to a demowhere we go over AVKit integrationwith HLS interstitials on tvOS.Here we have an ad scheduled to startat some 40 seconds into playback.And this ad has no navigation restrictions set.You can see that the ad marker is visible on the timeline.As the ad is playing, a countdown timer appearsover the playhead.And since this ad has no restrictions set,as I glide my hand over to the edgeof the Apple TV remote, I'd get an option to skip.And doing so would cause us to skip out of the adand go back to the primary.Now for this one, we have the same setup,but the ad has the skip restriction set.So now when the ad plays,you will not see an option to skip out of the ad.You will have to wait for it to play out completelybefore returning to the primary.Tom Hanks in "Greyhound."Rated PG-13. Exclusively on Apple TV+.Thank you, Josh.Here we have two ads as we see on this timeline.The first with no navigation restrictionsand the second with a jump restriction.So when we attempt to jump past both the ads...We see that the playhead snapsto the restricted ad marker while the ad plays.We'll bring hell down from on high.Tom Hanks in "Greyhound."Rated PG-13. Exclusively on Apple TV+.And after the ad plays out,we'd resume from the seek location.To wrap up, you can now scheduleserver side ads using DATERANGE tags.You'd want to specify the resume offset to be 0for video-on-demand streams such that you'd rejointhe program from where you left off.And you could skip this attribute for live streamsso that we rejoin at the live edge.You can use the X-ASSET-LIST attribute for late bindingof your ad assets,schedule early return in live broadcastsusing the X-PLAYOUT-LIMIT attribute,and specify navigation restrictionswith the X-RESTRICT attribute.To monitor ad playback on the client side,you'd use the AVPlayer- InterstitialEventMonitor.And you can programatically set adsusing the AVPlayer- InterstitialEventController.Thank you for watching
