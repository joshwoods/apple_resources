Search this video…♪ ♪Hi, I'm Harry, an engineer on the SwiftUI team.Welcome to "Craft search experiences in SwiftUI."Search is all-new in SwiftUI this year,and I'm excited to show youhow to start using these features.Sometimes, you want to find somethingspecific within an app, but many apps containlarge collections of data, which can make it difficultto find exactly what you're looking for.Whether it's finding the latest app trend,your next favorite song,or the right podcast for your morning commute,implementing search helps do just that.The best search experience will varybased on the structure and content of the app.But, in general, all experiences will includea search field that defines a search query.Now, you can implement search directly in SwiftUI.Let's take a look.In this talk, I'll introduce the new searchable modifierthat forms the foundation of all search features in SwiftUI.I'll showcase how a navigation viewintegrates with the searchable modifier.Finally, I'll cover extending the functionalityof searchable modifiers by adding search suggestions.Searchable is a new view modifier in SwiftUIavailable on all platforms.It allows you to mark view contentas being, well, searchable.The content will define exactly what that means.Throughout this talk, I'll explore examplesof this modifier on each platform.Now, to better understand this modifier,let's talk about the weather!A great example of search on iOScan be found in the new Weather app.When viewing your list of cities,you can start typing into the search bar,which will search for a new city to add to your list.To illustrate how Weather uses a searchable modifierto power this feature,let's break down the structure of their UI.Weather starts with a navigation view,which provides a navigation bar.Weather adds a custom list as the navigation view's content.And inside of that list, it adds a ForEach over its cells.Finally, Weather adds the searchable modifierto its navigation view.At the core of all searchable modifiersis the configuration of a search field.The searchable modifier takes the configured search fieldand passes that down,through the environment, for other views to usein the best way for each platform.Here, the navigation view understands that search fieldand will render it as a search bar.If no views use the configured search field,the searchable modifier provides a default implementationof rendering the search field in the toolbar.Now, a search field is often not the only pieceof search-related UI.Displaying some form of search resultsis a common design pattern.Weather follows this pattern,and whenever it sees a non-empty search query,it switches its custom list to display another listcontaining the results of the current query.Let's see how Weather can use information vendedby the searchable modifier to achieve this UI.Here's Weather's custom list.Searchable modifiers set up a new environment property,called isSearching, that Weather usesto dynamically change the view being displayed,based on whether a user is actively searching.Weather queries the isSearching environment propertyand the text of the searchto conditionally show its results view.When rendering your own results, consider using an overlayso that the state of your main UI is unchangedafter a user returns from their search interaction.Let's talk a little bit more about how a navigation viewintegrates with the new searchable modifier.To do that, I'd like to introducean app I've been working tirelessly on.I call it Colors.This app lets users manage a libraryof their favorite sets of colors, called Palettes.Maybe you wanna play with different paintsfor your room, themes for your app,or just get help picking the color of your new M1 iMac.No matter your desire, Colors is the app for you.The basic structure of Colors is a double-columnnavigation view, where the first column,the root view, is a sidebar on iPadOS and macOS,or the root of a navigation stack on other platforms.In the sidebar, you can see my library of color palettes.In the detail view, you can seethe currently selected color palette,as well as how those colorsmight appear to users with visual differences.As people started using the app, I began to notice something.People love colors.They're adding colors to their library constantly,but as a library gets large, it becomes difficult to finda specific color palette, as people have to scrollthrough their whole library to find it.At this point, I've decided it’s timeto add search functionality.I'd like this feature to follow platform conventionsso that people using my app immediately understand it.Let's take a look at how I can usethe searchable modifier to implement this feature.Here I have the navigation view I builtas part of the Colors app.To implement search, I'll add the searchable modifierto my navigation view.Just like before, I'll provide it with a bindingto the state backing the search query.Again, this will be rendered as a search baron iOS and iPadOS.When a navigation view isthe searchable modifier's content,it associates the search field with one of its columns.Which column it uses is dependent on the numberof columns provided to the navigation view.Since I have a two-column navigation view,the search bar is associated with the sidebar columnon both iOS and iPadOS.If you want the search field associated with a columnother than the default, you can placethe searchable modifier on your desired column,like you would with the existing toolbar modifier.For this app, I'll keep searchableon the navigation view.Just like with Weather, I'll use the isSearchingenvironment property to dynamically displaymy search results over the sidebar.The same placement of the searchable modifier on macOSwill render the search field placedin the most trailing position of the toolbar,with behaviors expected on that platform,like automatically collapsing as a window shrinks.Here, I'll render my search resultsin the detail pane of the appfor a more typical experience on macOS.watchOS behaves similarly to iOS in that it, too,places a search field at the top of the view in the toolbar.Here, SwiftUI chooses the first columnto associate the search field with.Notice how I didn't change where I placed the searchable modifierto produce these different behaviors across the platforms.The structure of my app didn't change across these platformsand remained a double-column navigation view.SwiftUI understands this structureand the different platform conventions,so it handled implementing them on my behalf.When I look at tvOS, I realize that the structureof my app on the other platforms could be made more appropriate.tvOS typically renders search as a tab in a tab view,but my app has no tab view.With just a few tweaks to my app, I can fix that.Instead of rendering a double-column navigation view,I can make a more typical tvOS experienceby rendering a single-column navigation viewwith a tab view as the navigation view’s content.In my tab view, I'll place the existing sidebar viewand add a new search tab.The search tab represents the placeholder viewthat will be visible when someone first navigatesto that tab.Finally, instead of wrapping the navigation view,I'll move the searchable modifier to wrap my search tab.Once a non-empty search query has been entered,I'll transition my view to display my search results.Now I've added search functionality to each platform.Thanks to the declarative nature of SwiftUI,where the navigation structure of my app remained consistent,I was able to rely on SwiftUI, and let the implementationof the searchable modifier pick the appropriate interfacefor that particular navigation structure.On tvOS, where the structure of my app changed,I took what I learned about the searchable modifierand applied that to the different structure.Only what I defined as "searchable" changedwith that structure.Now that you have an understandingof the searchable modifier, let's move onto our final topic: search suggestions.After using search in my app, a few users have reportedthat while they really like the new functionalitysearch provides, they're sometimes at a lossfor what they're able to search for.Many apps use search suggestions to help guide peopletowards the type of search queries they can provide.These suggestions represent completed search queriesthat may be presented in a menu, like on macOS,in a list, like on iOS, or as buttonthat presents a list, like on watchOS.Suggestions give people an ideafor the types of things they can search for.SwiftUI offers an easy wayto add search suggestions to your apps.Let's take a look.Looking at my app, you can see that I've configureda searchable modifier with text.Searchable modifiers offer an optional parameter,called suggestions, that I can start including.For the suggestions parameter, I'll provide a view.This might just be a few static buttonsor, more likely, it will be a ForEach over a dynamic setof suggestions coming from my apps database or from a server.SwiftUI looks at this view and will present itbased on whether there are any suggestions to display.For example, watchOS will render an icon in its search fieldwhen you provide non-empty suggestions.A common pattern here might be to provide a ForEach of buttonsthat, when interacted with, updates the text bindingprovided to the searchable modifierwith the search suggestion’s textual value.In fact, we expect this pattern to be so common that we've addeda searchCompletion modifier that does just this.You can use the searchCompletion modifierwith non-interactive views.It will convert that view into a buttonthat updates the search text and dismissesthe currently presented suggestion.If you're creating an app where users first interactwith suggestions to then fetch a complete set of search resultsbased on that suggestion,consider using the new onSubmit modifierto know when to fetch your search results.Pass in a value of search to the onSubmit modifier,and the closure you provide will be invokedwhenever the user submits their search query.This typically occurswhen they select a search suggestionor press Enter on a hardware keyboard.You can also use the new onSubmit modifierin conjunction with text fields or secure fieldsfor non-search-related submissions.Using the suggestions parameter along with the searchcompletion modifier provides an easy way to addpowerful search-suggestion functionality to your app.I hope you've enjoyed a brief tourof some of the search functionalitythat SwiftUI now offers.In summary, a searchable modifier allows youto describe view content as searchable.Navigation views integrate with the searchable modifierto provide platform-appropriate experiencesbased on the content of the navigation view.Use the environment's isSearching propertyto dynamically adjust the UI of your appwhen a user is searching.Use the search completion modifierand the suggestions parameter of the searchable modifierto add search suggestions to your app.Now, go out there and start adding searchto all your SwiftUI apps, and have a great WW.[upbeat music]
