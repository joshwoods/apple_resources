their music together,whether it’s with people in the same room, next door,or on the other side of the world.And now with GroupActivities,it’s easier than ever to provide a SharePlay experienceto your users, wherever they are.In this session, we'll cover four topics.An introduction to coordinated playback in Safari;how to prepare your iOS app to work with SharePlay in Safari;how to adopt the Media Session API in your app's web page;and a new web API for coordinating playbackacross multiple devices.So let’s start by talking a little bit about SharePlayand Safari.In the previous session, you learned how to createan amazing SharePlay experience in your iPhoneand iPad applications with GroupActivities.And on macOS Monterey,you can bring that same experience --along with your great iPhone and iPad apps --to Mac using Catalyst.And if your application has a companion website,you can bring that same amazing SharePlay experienceto your Mac Safari 15 users,without requiring those users to download your appfrom the App Store.And that’s what I’m going to show you how to doin this session.I’ve been working on an iPhone applicationthat lets you watch movie trailers.I’ve already added support for GroupActivities to my app,and that lets friends watch movie trailers togetherover FaceTime.But my movie trailers app also has a website.And here’s how it should look once I add supportfor GroupActivities in that web page as well.I’m on a FaceTime call with my friend Sam.Sam loves watching movie trailers,so I’ve asked themto help me test this new Movie Trailers app.When they start playing a new trailer in that appduring our call,I’ll be invited to watch that trailer through a notification.It will give me the option to join the session in Safari.When I click that notification,Safari will be launched with a URL for the shared content,and when Sam starts playing the trailer,it will play here in Safari at the same time.I can pause, play, and even seek the video here in Safari,and everyone else in the session will see those same commandsreflected in their local video at the same time.It's going to be really great!So, what will it take to add GroupActivities supportto the movie trailers website?Before we take a look under the hood of Safari --at the new Web APIs available in Safari 15 --let's talk about how to get your app ready to workwith Safari through GroupActivities.In order to join a GroupActivities sessionwith Safari, a user with your iPhone or iPad appwill need to create a GroupSessionActivitywith a fallbackURL that points to your website.The fallbackURL must identify not just your website,but the specific content to be played.When a Watch Together invitation is issued by an iPhone userto a user on a Mac,Safari will be launched and asked to load the URLthat you provide in GroupSessionActivity.Once the fallbackURL is loaded in Safari,your site will need to implementa few simple but important Web APIs.The first is Media Session.Media Session is a standard Web APIwhich allows your site to tell the browser -- Safari --more about the current state of media playbackwithin your page.Your site can tell the browser the current play state,the duration of your content.It can provide artwork for the current playback item.It can even tell the browser that the current contentis an advertisement that can be skipped.Once the Browser has all this metadata available,it can provide that metadata to the rest of the operating systemand present it to your usersoutside of the browser window itself.One place the operating system displays that datais within something called "Now Playing."Now Playing is a great way for users to quickly seeand control the media that they’re enjoying right now.In iOS, users can access Now Playingfrom the Control Center as well as from the Lock screen.And now in macOS Monterey, users can access Now Playingdirectly from the menu bar.And Safari will use the informationprovided through Media Session to populate Now Playingwith your content’s title, duration, play state, artwork,and more.Now Playing also allows users to control playbackof what they’re listening to,by showing the user a simple set of playback controls.Your site can register with the Media Sessionfor specific actions to performwhen a user interacts with Now Playing,so that for example,when a user taps the Play button in Now Playing,Safari can run your site’s own action handlerto begin playback.Media Session gives your site complete controlover what metadata to expose to the browser,as well as control over how to implement playback commands.Need to do some set up or preflightingbefore beginning playback?No problem.With mediaSession’s play action handler,now you can.If your site has previously adopted Media Session,you’re halfway done already.But the movie trailers site hasn’t adopted Media Sessionyet, so let’s add support for that now.This site will want to add actions for play,pause, and seekto.To do so, we’ll use the mediaSession propertyof navigator.Let’s first add an action handler for play.We’ll call mediaSession. setActionHandler(),passing in the string play and an inline functionthat just calls play() on our video element.Then, we’ll do the same for pause and seekto.And to make sure that we’re accuratelyrepresenting playback state to the browser,we’ll add event listeners to our video elementand update mediaSession when that state changes.First, let’s add a functioncalled updateMediaSessionState().It will query the video elementto find out if it’s playing or paused.Then it will set mediaSession’s playbackState propertyto either the string playing or paused,depending on the video element’s playback state.Next, it will query the video element’s duration,playback rate, and current time.Then, using those values,it will call mediaSession’s setPositionState() function,passing in those values in the dictionary parameter.Then, let’s add an event listenerto detect when those values change,and call updateMediaSessionState()to update mediaSession with those new values.We’ll need an event listener for playing,pause, duration change, rate change, and time change.And last, because the movie trailers websitehas both a title string and a URL for the title artwork,we can set the Media Session’s metadata propertyto a new MediaMetadata object containing those values.So let’s try it out!I’ll reload my page in Safari, begin playing,then click on the Now Playing icon in the system menu.And I see the title and artwork in the Now Playing panel.And when I tap the Pause button,our pause action handler is called and playback pauses.Media Session provides the building blocksfor a Watch Together experience in a web page,by providing a mechanism for the browser to tell the pageit should start or stop playback.Now we’re ready move onto the second partof creating a cowatching experience in our web page:coordinating playback across every device in the session.To do so, we’ve extended Media Sessionby adding a new property on it called "Coordinator."Your page will use Media Session's Coordinatorto inform every other user in the session of the page’s intentto begin or pause playback,to seek to a specific point in the media’s timeline,or to move to the next item in a playlist.The Coordinator will communicate those intentswith all the other devices in the sessionand listen for changes to every other device's play state,resolve conflicts,and wait for everyone to be ready to begin playback.And when everyone is ready,the Coordinator will use the Media Session action handlerswe added earlier to start playbackalong all the other users in the session.And if another user pauses playback for whatever reason,the Coordinator will call your Media Session’spause action handler.That said, I’d like to point out a few caveats.The Coordinator interface is an experimental web API;it has yet to go through standardization,and while that process will likely improve this API,some aspects of the API may change.To find out more,please watch the W3C’s Media Session GitHub page.This API is currently only implemented in Safari,though the GroupActivities framework,which Safari uses to implement the Coordinator,can -- and we hope will -- be adopted by other Mac browsers.And the final caveat is that while your users can joinan existing session in Safari,a GroupSession currently must be initiatedfrom an iPhone, iPad, or macOS application.So let’s add support for the Coordinator now.The first thing I’d like to do is join the sessiononce it becomes available.So I’m going to add a coordinatorchange event listenerto mediaSession.In the handler, if there’s a non-null coordinator propertyon mediaSession, I’ll call its join() function.I’d also like to add an icon to my controlsto show that we’re playing back in a session.So in the handler, I’ll either show or hide the icon,based on whether there’s a coordinator propertyon mediaSession.I’m also going to hook up a click event listener to the iconto call leave() on the coordinator.Next, I’m going to modify the event handlersfor my custom controlsto check for the presence of a coordinator, and if we have one,call the appropriate coordinator function instead.I’ll add one for my Play button, and then for my Pause button,and also for timeline slider.And let’s see it in action!I’ve got an invite here from my friend Sam,and I’m going to accept it.My page loads to the same contentthat Sam is watching on their iPhone.And when I click the Play button, both Sam's iPhoneand my web page begin playing simultaneously.Allie Fox: The way we get there is an adventure.Dina: I'm scared.Allie: If it didn't feel that way,it wouldn't be an adventure.♪ <That was great.Now that the trailer's ended,Sam uses the iPhone to scrub back to the beginning.We think that users are going to love watching or listeningto their favorite content together in your applications,whether it’s on their iPhone, iPad, Apple TV,or in Safari running on their Mac.And we hope you can now bring that experienceto all of your users, wherever they are.For more information about GroupActivities APIs,start with the sessions"Coordinate media playback with Group Activities"and "Design for Group Activities."If you’re interested in the other new web APIsthat will be available in Safari 15,make sure to check out the session,"Develop advanced web content."Thanks for coming and enjoy the rest of your WWDC21.♪
