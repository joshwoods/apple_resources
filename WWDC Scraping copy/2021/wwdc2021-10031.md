Understanding CPU Usage with Web Inspector

Search this video…♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Patrick Angle: Hi! I’m Patrick,an engineer on the WebKit Developer Experience team,and it is my pleasure to show yousome of the many exciting features and improvementsthat are new in Web Inspector this year.Web Inspector is part of Safari on macOSand gives web developers and designersaccess to a rich set of toolsto inspect their web pages and web applications.It allows you to inspectall the resources and activity on a web page,and works seamlessly across macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS.This year, I am thrilled to show younew features in Web Inspectorstarting with a new overlay for visualizing your CSS Grids,enhancements to breakpoints,and the ability to author and edit auditsright in Web Inspector.Before I talk about these new features,if you haven’t used Web Inspector before,you’ll have to enable it.In the Advanced tab of Safari’s Preferences,enable “Show Develop menu in menu bar”.Web Inspector can then be opened usingthe Show Web Inspector item in the Develop menu.Now that Web Inspector is enabled,let’s look at our first new tool this year: grid overlays.Web page layout these days can be quite complicated.CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout systemthat makes it easy for designers to lay out contentin a way that is both incredibly powerfulas well as instantly familiarto anyone who has ever worked in printed design.A structure of rows and columns is definedwhere elements are then placed or distributed in the gridto achieve a flexible yet predictable layout.Grid is a highly capable way to lay out your web page,but it can bring a host of new questions and confusionas your layouts become more complex.Like, Why is my column this size?Or, Why is this blue box down here?Previously in Web Inspector,the primary source of answers to these pressing questionswas the Style sidebar in the Elements tab,which this year has moved to its own independent sidebar,allowing you to view matching CSS rulesalongside other panels like Computed styles.If you look at a grid’s authored style,you can glean some information about its layout.But the grid’s authored styleonly gets you part of the way there.Wouldn’t it be great if there was a more visual wayto digest this information with Web Inspector?Well, now there is!If you look at the elements in the DOM tree,you’ll see a new clickable grid badgenext to each of the elements that are a CSS Grid.Here, we see the badge for one of the two CSS Gridson our page.If we click this new badge and return to our web page,you can see the new grid overlayon top of your existing content,allowing you to visualize the layout of the grid inlinewithout the mental gymnastics of reading your authored CSSand hoping it does what you think it will.But what if this isn’t the exact informationyou want to see about your grid?What about grid areas, line names, and other options?To answer that, let’s return to Web Inspector.Here, you can find another new feature,the Layout panel, which shows all the options and controlsrelated to grid overlays.First, let's take a look at the list of grids on the page.Here you have the optionto toggle all of the grid overlays on or off all at once.Or you can toggle a single grid’s overlay off or on.Each grid is listed with its corresponding CSS selectorto help identify it in the list.Next to each listed grid is a color swatchthat allows you to interactively changethe color of the grid overlay,and the badges on each element will use this colorwhen that grid overlay is enabled.Web Inspector will remember your color for each elementthe next time the same page is loaded.Now let’s take a look at the options we haveto control how these overlays are displayed,starting with track sizes,which show the authored sizes of each track --which is a row or column -- of your grid.Like here, where a mix of fractional unitsand min-content are used.Next, line numbers show you the values that can be usedto place child elements at specific rows or columnsin your grid.We’ve placed negative line numbers --which represent line numberscounting from the last explicit grid line --inside the label, alongside the positive line numbersto allow you to choose how you want to place your item.Line names provide another wayto refer to your lines in your grid based on area namesas well as lines that have been explicitly named.Area names allow you to seeeach of the named areas in your grid,which is helpful if you want to place children in your gridwithout addressing the lineson each side of your desired placement.We’ve placed area names in the center of each areaand outlined each area in a thick stroke.Lastly, turning on extended gridlineson this second grid container allows you to seethe track lines extended to the edge of the page,allowing you to visually compare the grid’s alignmentto other elements on your page.We’ve built our overlays with performance in mind,and you can enable as many as you need,all while smoothly scrolling through your page.Dozens of grids can be shown simultaneously,all while providing you buttery-smooth scrolling.They work for all writing modes like this vertically set textoriginally from Wikipedia,right-to-left text direction,and combinations thereof.And these overlays are also availableon iOS 15 and iPadOS 15when inspecting remotely from a Mac with Safari 15or the latest Safari Technology Preview.We believe that gridis an incredibly important layout tool on the web,and that is why we have brought these tools to Web Inspector,enabling you to visualize and debug gridacross all of our platformsto continue to create incredible layouts.Now let’s take a look at how grid overlays can help usto better understand and solve problems on our web pages.Let’s take a look at a web page I’ve been working onthat gives me a quick overviewof information I want to see each morning.I can see my commute, the weather forecast for the day --looks like I’ll want a jacket tonight! --and a list of things to pick up at the storeafter work today.This page is laid out with CSS Grid,which made it easy to create these varying sized tilesand place them on my page.But wait, it looks like I forgot to place one of these fun emojisI used to decorate my dashboard.It belongs down here with the rest of my emojis!No problem. I can use our new grid overlayto help me place it exactly where I’d like.To begin inspecting my page,I’ll right-click on my problematic elementand select Inspect Element.If you don’t see Inspect Element,make sure to enable Web Inspectorlike we discussed earlier.I’ll then select the Layout panel in the Details sidebar,where I can see all the grid contexts on my page.I can’t quite remember which of these gridsI want to work with, but I can enableall of the overlays at once by checking the top checkboxfor all grid overlays.I now see the grid context I want to work withis the pink one, which holds all of my tiles.I’ll just turn off the other two overlaysby unchecking them in this list of grid contexts.And now I’m left with only the grid overlay I’m interested in.If you're like me, you may only want to seeexactly the information you need to perform the task at hand,so I’m going to disable Track Sizes labelsso I can focus just on the line numbersfor placing my stray emoji.And now the remaining line number labelslet me see exactly where I want to place my emoji:at column track line 6 and row track line 4.Because I explicitly right-clickedand inspected the tile for my problematic emoji,it's already selected for me,and I can jump right to editing its style to test my fix.And with our new three-panel layout,I can keep the Layout panel visible at the same time,which is great for when I want to switchwhich labels or grid overlays I’m showingwhile testing different styles on my pagewithout constantly switching between panels.In the Styles panel, I'm going to clickin the Style Attribute section and add a new property,grid-area.I can then type a colon to jump to editingmy new property's value where I will enter "4 / 6"for row track line 4 and column track line 6.Perfect, my emoji is right where I want it now.But now that I think about it some more,I really want to make sure this emoji is always in this corner,even if I add or remove rows or columns from my grid later.In the same labels that gave me valuesof row track line 4 and column track line 6,I see a second line number, -3, for each.This negative line number will actually keep my emojithree track lines from the end of the gridI’ve explicitly defined,and will be perfect for my situation.I’ll update my grid-area property’s valueto these new values, "-3 / -3",and see that my emoji is still in the correct place,and will continue to be if I add another rowor remove another column from my grid.This new overlay coming to Web Inspectorhelped me quickly adjust the layout of my page,and is great for understanding existing layoutsas well as designing new layouts.Now let’s talk about improvementsin JavaScript debugging with breakpoints.For scripts, we often start with console.logas we try to figure out why our script isn’t workingthe way we think it should.Alternatively, if you’ve never tried breakpoints,I highly recommend checking them out.They are powerful and, as we’ll see in just a moment,even more configurable than before.If you're new to breakpoints,the easiest way to get started is in the Sources tabby clicking in the line gutter of your JavaScripton a line at which you’d like to pause.This creates a breakpoint which, when reached,will pause your script at the beginning of that line,waiting to execute the line;allow you to step through your codeone statement at a time;or dive deeper into a specific statement;and view the state of your variablesevery step of the way.But there's so much more to breakpoints!In fact, there are five different types of breakpoints,one for every occasion.There are breakpoints for debugger statements,exceptions, and assertions;JavaScript breakpoints,which you can set on lines of JavaScript;event breakpoints, which pausewhen an event like click, timeouts, intervals,or animation frames are handled;DOM breakpoints,which pause when actions related to a DOM node occur.These can be added in the Elements tab,or from the context menu for any node previewin Web Inspector.And URL breakpoints, which pausewhen a network request is about to be made for a URLvia APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch.You can configure your JavaScript breakpointsby right-clicking on a breakpointand selecting Edit Breakpoint.Here, you can control numerous aspects of the breakpoint.Let’s take a look at each of these options.We can set a condition,which must be true for the breakpoint to be hit.New this year, we now support using Web Inspector’sConsole tab API inside expressionsin breakpoint conditions and actions,like this one that refers to the currently selected DOM nodein the Elements tab.In some cases, a breakpoint conditionmay be better expressed as a number of timesto ignore the breakpoint before it is hit,like while inside a loop where we don’t want to stopuntil some number of iterations have been completed.This can be used in addition to or instead of a conditionto control when the breakpoint will fire.When used in addition to a condition,the count of ignored invocations is incrementedonly if the condition was satisfied.Next, you can define actions that are takenwhen your breakpoint is hit,like evaluating JavaScript in contextwith access to variables,as if the code was inline in your JavaScript source;log messages to the console easilywith a template string literal;play a system beep so you audibly knowthe breakpoint was hit;and define a probe expression,which is evaluated with its result saved in the Probe panelof the Details sidebar of the Sources tab,allowing you to see the results of the expressionas it changes over the lifetime of your web page.New this year, the action typesthat support JavaScript expressionscan be set to emulate a user gesture,which can be helpful when interacting with JavaScript APIsthat normally require a user to have initiated them,like playing a video,enabling you to quickly test new behaviorbefore implementing the change in the web page’s source.You can mix and match any number of these actionsto customize your breakpoints,including multiple of any action type.Lastly, you can have your breakpointautomatically continue after evaluatingand performing your actionsfor situations where you just wantedto add some logging or a quick patch to testwithout modifying the underlying web page.These options for configuring breakpointsare incredibly versatile,and this year I’m pleased to tell youthat they are now available for all breakpoint types,not just JavaScript breakpoints.This enables you to set powerful breakpoint conditions,like only pausing on click eventsfor a specific type of element, like button;or playing a system beep when a network requestis made for a specific URL.These configuration options being availablefor all breakpoint types make already great debugging toolseven better by helping you cut through the noise --or even make a little noise -- at just the right time.Now, let’s return to my dashboard web pageand take a look at an issue that these new toolswill make a breeze to debug and test a patch for.I recently added a button to my commute tilethat I want to use to share my estimated commute timewith someone else.You never know when you might end up running late.Unfortunately, when I click my Share button,nothing happens.Even worse, it’s been a few days since I’ve worked on this tileand I don’t rememberwhere I handle click events for this button.Fortunately, I can use an event breakpointto pause in my click event handler to find my code.I can create event breakpoints here in the Sources tab.Clicking the plus in the top rightof the breakpoint section of the Navigation Sidebar,and selecting Event Breakpoint,allows me to define a new event breakpoint.I’ll set the event to click,and then press the Return key to create my new breakpoint.I now see my click breakpointlisted in the Navigation Sidebar.This event breakpoint should pausewhen I click my button.But first, I want to make sure I’m sharingthe most up-to-date time estimate for my commute,so I’ll click my Refresh button and -- Oops!My event breakpoint will actually pausefor all click events, including my Refresh button,even though I really only want to pausewhen I click on my Share button.Let’s modify my breakpoint using the new configuration optionsthat are available this year.I can edit my breakpoint by right-clicking on itand choosing Edit Breakpoint.Here, I get a popover with the configuration optionsfor the event breakpoint.I need to add a conditionto make sure I only pause when I need to.In this case, I can use some Web Inspector console APIto get the current event with "$event",and check if the event’s target is equal to my Share button.Instead of hard-coding my breakpointfor this specific button,I’ll use another piece of console APIto check if the event’s targetis the currently selected DOM node in the Elements tabwith "$0".I can click out of the configuration popoverand all my changes are automatically applied.I’m still paused on my breakpointfrom clicking on the Refresh button,so I’ll click the Continue buttonto resume script execution on my page.Now, when I click on my Refresh button,my commute time updates and my breakpoint isn’t hit.But if I right-click on my Share button,and select Inspect Element to make it the selected element,I can now click on my Share button and bingo!The breakpoint paused exactly where I wanted it to,and now I see why my Share button doesn’t work:I forgot to write this function.Breakpoints can save the day -- or at least this demo -- again,and help me patch sharing in right now to test my changesbefore I go back to the source to implement them.I’ll add a breakpoint in my share functionby clicking in the line gutter,right-clicking on the breakpoint indicator,and choosing Edit Breakpoint.I don’t need a condition on this breakpoint,but I want to add an action.The default action type, Evaluate JavaScript,is exactly what I want here.I’ll add my JavaScript to the action,which will call "navigator.share"with an object I’ve already prepared with my data,"this.shareData".I don’t actually need to pause my scriptas part of testing this fix, so I’ll also enableAutomatically continue after evaluating.Like before,clicking outside the popover saves my changes.I'm done with my click event breakpoint for now,so let's click on its indicator to disable it.I'll also click the Continue buttonto resume script execution on my page.I can now click on my Share button,and am presented with the Share menu.I'll select Notes to confirm my share data is correct.This looks correct, so now I can go back to my source codeand make this change.Awesome!These enhancements to breakpointsmade it possible to identify and test a solutionwithout having to pepper my sourcewith console.log statements.And now that I have a working solution,I can go add my fix to my source.Now let’s take a look at an exciting new feature for audits:the ability to create and edit your testsright in Web Inspector.Each test in the Audit tab is written in JavaScriptand is run against the inspected web page.These tests can check for incorrect DOM structure,help enforce design system rules,or help make sure you haven’t missed accessibility attributes.In addition to individual tests,you can share and run groups of tests.By default, Web Inspector has two test groups:the Demo Audit, which provides a tour of the way audits workand the functionality they support,and a suite of accessibility tests that check for a subsetof the DOM accessibility best practicesin accordance with the ARIA specification,such as ensuring that a title or alternate textis set on all image elements.You can run a test by selecting itand using the Start button next to the audit name,or run all of your tests with the Start buttonat the top of the Navigation Sidebar.After your tests have run,you can see the results of each testas well as an overall summary of passes and failures.If there are any failures,you can see information about those failuresso you can get them patched up.To share your tests,or to edit them in an external text editor,you can export the test,make your changes to the resulting JSON file,and then import the modified test back into Web Inspector.This process of exporting and importingis great for sharing your tests across your teamor with the community.And this year, we are making creating and editing testseven easier with a new Edit mode.When you click on the Edit buttonin the bottom of the Navigation Sidebar,the Audit tab transforms into Editing mode,where you now have the ability to create new testsas well as edit your existing tests.Note that the default Demo Audit and Accessibility test groupscannot be deleted or edited, but can be duplicatedand then the duplicate can be edited.For now, let’s look at creating a new testby using the Create item in the Navigation Sidebar.You can create a new test case, or a group of test cases.For now, let’s look at creating a new test case.When we create a new test case,you see that it is added to the Navigation Sidebar,and the default contents of the test appear for you to edit.Here you have several different things available to configure.The name, as well as the description of the test,and the minimum audit version the test supports,which makes sure the audit is not runin an older version of Web Inspectorwhere some features may not be supported.The setup script is JavaScript that will be executedbefore every top-level test or test group.This allows you to perform common setup functionsthat all tests under this top-level test rely on.And last, but certainly not least,there is the test itself, which is a JavaScript functionthat can return true or false or a result objectwith more information about the test’s run.A special WebInspectorAudit object is also available,which exposes additional API specifically for tests to usein both the test itself as well as the setup for the test.You can learn more about this APIin the Web Inspector Reference.Your changes are automatically saved,and all of this can now be done in Web Inspectorwithout exporting.But to really get a feel for the flexibility of these tests,I’d like to show you them in action.Let’s return to my dashboard one last timeand see how audits can help me catchsome types of accessibility problemsas well as design issues in my web page.The first thing I like to do when I open the Audit tabis to run the default Accessibility test cases.These will help me get a good baseline readingfor how I’m doing on common accessibility best practices.I can quickly run these tests by clicking on the Run buttonnext to the test group.And not bad, but I can do better.I can look at the test failuresby clicking the Passed filter button to hide those results,leaving only my test failure to view.Let’s get this fixed.This test provides a list of DOM nodes that failed,making it easy to jump to that nodeusing the Reveal in Elements Tab button that appears on hover.In the Elements tab, I’ll test adding a title to my imageby right-clicking on the DOM nodechoosing Add > Attribute, and typing my new title.I’ll return to the Audit taband run the same test group again.And this time, I see that I pass all the tests.Another great use for audits is checking to make suremy web page meets my own design standards.One of my rules while working on this projectwas to make sure I was consistently usinga small set of font families for all of my elements.Let’s use the new Audit Edit Mode,added to Web Inspector this year, to do just that.I’ll begin editing by clicking on the Edit buttonat the bottom of the Navigation Sidebar.Now I’m in Edit Mode.Here I can create a new test caseusing the Create button at the top of the sidebar.I’ll keep the default option of Test Case,and name my test case "Fonts."I can now edit the rest of my test case.I’ll start by adding a descriptionto help me remember what this test case does.Now let’s insert my actual test code I’ve prepared.My test will have three main steps.First, I’ll create an array of expected font families.Next, I’ll collect all the elements on my pagewith a font family that isn’t listedin my expected font families.Lastly, I’ll return my result object,including any elements that failed my test.When I’m done writing my audit,I just click Done at the bottom of the Navigation Sidebar.I can now run my audit by clicking the Run buttonnext to its name.It looks like I have an issuewith one of the nodes on my page,so let’s take a look at what's wrong.I can again use the Reveal in Elements Tab buttonto go to the element and look at its style.Well, this is embarrassing.Comic Sans!I really don't want to use this font,so let's change this to the ui-rounded font family instead.Now, I’ll return to the Audit tab,run my test again, and perfect!The last thing I want to do is export my testusing the Export Audit buttonso that I can share it with my colleaguesto help them avoid the same embarrassing mistake I made --although maybe I’ll leave outthe Comic Sans part of the story.Not only were the built-in accessibility testsable to catch an issue I missed, I was able to write a testto enforce my own design system rules for my web page,making it even easier for teamsto make sure everyone is on the same pagebefore ever checking in their changes.And with that, we’ve covered these big new featuresin Web Inspector!A new overlay for CSS Grid helps make sure your contentlooks just right.Breakpoint improvements make it easier to find, debug,and test fixes for issues without leaving Web Inspector.And with the new audit creating and editingright in Web Inspector,you can quickly create tests to make sure web pagesmeet accessibility standards as well as your own standards.Along with these new features,we’ve made tweaks and enhancementsas well as fixed numerous bugsto further improve Web Inspector.Before I go, there are some helpful resourcesI’d like to leave you with.You may not have realized that Web Inspectoris part of the open source WebKit project,which is the fast, private, and secureweb browser engine used by Safari, Mail, App Store,and many other apps on macOS and iOS.You can learn more about the WebKit project at webkit.org,where you'll also find blog postsabout new features in WebKit,including this one about grid overlays in Web Inspector.In addition to blog posts about new features in Web Inspector,you can also find documentation which coversa wide range of Web Inspector’s features and interface,and goes deep on many of the features we discussed today,like audits and breakpoints.There's so much more depth to those featuresthan I was able to cover today, and I highly recommendchecking out the documentationif you’d like to learn more.We also would love to hear from you!If you come across a bug or have a suggestionon how we can improve Web Inspector,please file feedback for macOS in Feedback Assistant,and select WebKit as the area for your feedback.I’d also like to invite you to downloadSafari Technology Preview,released approximately every two weeks,which is designed specifically for developersto get early access to new WebKit and Web Inspector tools,features, and fixesbefore they appear in the version of Safariincluded on every Mac, iPhone, and iPad.Lastly, please check out these other great sessions,including “Design for Safari 15,”to learn how to adapt and design beautiful content for Safari;and “Develop advanced web content,” to learn all aboutnew JavaScript and WebAssembly featuresyou can use to further enhance your web pages.Also take a look at our session,“What’s new in Web Inspector,” from WWDC 2020to see even more improvements we’ve made in Web Inspector.You can find these fabulous sessions,and many more, in your Developer app.Thank you!♪

clickin the Style Attribute section and add a new property,grid-area.I can then type a colon to jump to editingmy new property's value where I will enter "4 / 6"for row track line 4 and column track line 6.Perfect, my emoji is right where I want it now.But now that I think about it some more,I really want to make sure this emoji is always in this corner,even if I add or remove rows or columns from my grid later.In the same labels that gave me valuesof row track line 4 and column track line 6,I see a second line number, -3, for each.This negative line number will actually keep my emojithree track lines from the end of the gridI’ve explicitly defined,and will be perfect for my situation.I’ll update my grid-area property’s valueto these new values, "-3 / -3",and see that my emoji is still in the correct place,and will continue to be if I add another rowor remove another column from my grid.This new overlay coming to Web Inspectorhelped me quickly adjust the layout of my page,and is great for understanding existing layoutsas well as designing new layouts.Now let’s talk about improvementsin JavaScript debugging with breakpoints.For scripts, we often start with console.logas we try to figure out why our script isn’t workingthe way we think it should.Alternatively, if you’ve never tried breakpoints,I highly recommend checking them out.They are powerful and, as we’ll see in just a moment,even more configurable than before.If you're new to breakpoints,the easiest way to get started is in the Sources tabby clicking in the line gutter of your JavaScripton a line at which you’d like to pause.This creates a breakpoint which, when reached,will pause your script at the beginning of that line,waiting to execute the line;allow you to step through your codeone statement at a time;or dive deeper into a specific statement;and view the state of your variablesevery step of the way.But there's so much more to breakpoints!In fact, there are five different types of breakpoints,one for every occasion.There are breakpoints for debugger statements,exceptions, and assertions;JavaScript breakpoints,which you can set on lines of JavaScript;event breakpoints, which pausewhen an event like click, timeouts, intervals,or animation frames are handled;DOM breakpoints,which pause when actions related to a DOM node occur.These can be added in the Elements tab,or from the context menu for any node previewin Web Inspector.And URL breakpoints, which pausewhen a network request is about to be made for a URLvia APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch.You can configure your JavaScript breakpointsby right-clicking on a breakpointand selecting Edit Breakpoint.Here, you can control numerous aspects of the breakpoint.Let’s take a look at each of these options.We can set a condition,which must be true for the breakpoint to be hit.New this year, we now support using Web Inspector’sConsole tab API inside expressionsin breakpoint conditions and actions,like this one that refers to the currently selected DOM nodein the Elements tab.In some cases, a breakpoint conditionmay be better expressed as a number of timesto ignore the breakpoint before it is hit,like while inside a loop where we don’t want to stopuntil some number of iterations have been completed.This can be used in addition to or instead of a conditionto control when the breakpoint will fire.When used in addition to a condition,the count of ignored invocations is incrementedonly if the condition was satisfied.Next, you can define actions that are takenwhen your breakpoint is hit,like evaluating JavaScript in contextwith access to variables,as if the code was inline in your JavaScript source;log messages to the console easilywith a template string literal;play a system beep so you audibly knowthe breakpoint was hit;and define a probe expression,which is evaluated with its result saved in the Probe panelof the Details sidebar of the Sources tab,allowing you to see the results of the expressionas it changes over the lifetime of your web page.New this year, the action typesthat support JavaScript expressionscan be set to emulate a user gesture,which can be helpful when interacting with JavaScript APIsthat normally require a user to have initiated them,like playing a video,enabling you to quickly test new behaviorbefore implementing the change in the web page’s source.You can mix and match any number of these actionsto customize your breakpoints,including multiple of any action type.Lastly, you can have your breakpointautomatically continue after evaluatingand performing your actionsfor situations where you just wantedto add some logging or a quick patch to testwithout modifying the underlying web page.These options for configuring breakpointsare incredibly versatile,and this year I’m pleased to tell youthat they are now available for all breakpoint types,not just JavaScript breakpoints.This enables you to set powerful breakpoint conditions,like only pausing on click eventsfor a specific type of element, like button;or playing a system beep when a network requestis made for a specific URL.These configuration options being availablefor all breakpoint types make already great debugging toolseven better by helping you cut through the noise --or even make a little noise -- at just the right time.Now, let’s return to my dashboard web pageand take a look at an issue that these new toolswill make a breeze to debug and test a patch for.I recently added a button to my commute tilethat I want to use to share my estimated commute timewith someone else.You never know when you might end up running late.Unfortunately, when I click my Share button,nothing happens.Even worse, it’s been a few days since I’ve worked on this tileand I don’t rememberwhere I handle click events for this button.Fortunately, I can use an event breakpointto pause in my click event handler to find my code.I can create event breakpoints here in the Sources tab.Clicking the plus in the top rightof the breakpoint section of the Navigation Sidebar,and selecting Event Breakpoint,allows me to define a new event breakpoint.I’ll set the event to click,and then press the Return key to create my new breakpoint.I now see my click breakpointlisted in the Navigation Sidebar.This event breakpoint should pausewhen I click my button.But first, I want to make sure I’m sharingthe most up-to-date time estimate for my commute,so I’ll click my Refresh button and -- Oops!My event breakpoint will actually pausefor all click events, including my Refresh button,even though I really only want to pausewhen I click on my Share button.Let’s modify my breakpoint using the new configuration optionsthat are available this year.I can edit my breakpoint by right-clicking on itand choosing Edit Breakpoint.Here, I get a popover with the configuration optionsfor the event breakpoint.I need to add a conditionto make sure I only pause when I need to.In this case, I can use some Web Inspector console APIto get the current event with "$event",and check if the event’s target is equal to my Share button.Instead of hard-coding my breakpointfor this specific button,I’ll use another piece of console APIto check if the event’s targetis the currently selected DOM node in the Elements tabwith "$0".I can click out of the configuration popoverand all my changes are automatically applied.I’m still paused on my breakpointfrom clicking on the Refresh button,so I’ll click the Continue buttonto resume script execution on my page.Now, when I click on my Refresh button,my commute time updates and my breakpoint isn’t hit.But if I right-click on my Share button,and select Inspect Element to make it the selected element,I can now click on my Share button and bingo!The breakpoint paused exactly where I wanted it to,and now I see why my Share button doesn’t work:I forgot to write this function.Breakpoints can save the day -- or at least this demo -- again,and help me patch sharing in right now to test my changesbefore I go back to the source to implement them.I’ll add a breakpoint in my share functionby clicking in the line gutter,right-clicking on the breakpoint indicator,and choosing Edit Breakpoint.I don’t need a condition on this breakpoint,but I want to add an action.The default action type, Evaluate JavaScript,is exactly what I want here.I’ll add my JavaScript to the action,which will call "navigator.share"with an object I’ve already prepared with my data,"this.shareData".I don’t actually need to pause my scriptas part of testing this fix, so I’ll also enableAutomatically continue after evaluating.Like before,clicking outside the popover saves my changes.I'm done with my click event breakpoint for now,so let's click on its indicator to disable it.I'll also click the Continue buttonto resume script execution on my page.I can now click on my Share button,and am presented with the Share menu.I'll select Notes to confirm my share data is correct.This looks correct, so now I can go back to my source codeand make this change.Awesome!These enhancements to breakpointsmade it possible to identify and test a solutionwithout having to pepper my sourcewith console.log statements.And now that I have a working solution,I can go add my fix to my source.Now let’s take a look at an exciting new feature for audits:the ability to create and edit your testsright in Web Inspector.Each test in the Audit tab is written in JavaScriptand is run against the inspected web page.These tests can check for incorrect DOM structure,help enforce design system rules,or help make sure you haven’t missed accessibility attributes.In addition to individual tests,you can share and run groups of tests.By default, Web Inspector has two test groups:the Demo Audit, which provides a tour of the way audits workand the functionality they support,and a suite of accessibility tests that check for a subsetof the DOM accessibility best practicesin accordance with the ARIA specification,such as ensuring that a title or alternate textis set on all image elements.You can run a test by selecting itand using the Start button next to the audit name,or run all of your tests with the Start buttonat the top of the Navigation Sidebar.After your tests have run,you can see the results of each testas well as an overall summary of passes and failures.If there are any failures,you can see information about those failuresso you can get them patched up.To share your tests,or to edit them in an external text editor,you can export the test,make your changes to the resulting JSON file,and then import the modified test back into Web Inspector.This process of exporting and importingis great for sharing your tests across your teamor with the community.And this year, we are making creating and editing testseven easier with a new Edit mode.When you click on the Edit buttonin the bottom of the Navigation Sidebar,the Audit tab transforms into Editing mode,where you now have the ability to create new testsas well as edit your existing tests.Note that the default Demo Audit and Accessibility test groupscannot be deleted or edited, but can be duplicatedand then the duplicate can be edited.For now, let’s look at creating a new testby using the Create item in the Navigation Sidebar.You can create a new test case, or a group of test cases.For now, let’s look at creating a new test case.When we create a new test case,you see that it is added to the Navigation Sidebar,and the default contents of the test appear for you to edit.Here you have several different things available to configure.The name, as well as the description of the test,and the minimum audit version the test supports,which makes sure the audit is not runin an older version of Web Inspectorwhere some features may not be supported.The setup script is JavaScript that will be executedbefore every top-level test or test group.This allows you to perform common setup functionsthat all tests under this top-level test rely on.And last, but certainly not least,there is the test itself, which is a JavaScript functionthat can return true or false or a result objectwith more information about the test’s run.A special WebInspectorAudit object is also available,which exposes additional API specifically for tests to usein both the test itself as well as the setup for the test.You can learn more about this APIin the Web Inspector Reference.Your changes are automatically saved,and all of this can now be done in Web Inspectorwithout exporting.But to really get a feel for the flexibility of these tests,I’d like to show you them in action.Let’s return to my dashboard one last timeand see how audits can help me catchsome types of accessibility problemsas well as design issues in my web page.The first thing I like to do when I open the Audit tabis to run the default Accessibility test cases.These will help me get a good baseline readingfor how I’m doing on common accessibility best practices.I can quickly run these tests by clicking on the Run buttonnext to the test group.And not bad, but I can do better.I can look at the test failuresby clicking the Passed filter button to hide those results,leaving only my test failure to view.Let’s get this fixed.This test provides a list of DOM nodes that failed,making it easy to jump to that nodeusing the Reveal in Elements Tab button that appears on hover.In the Elements tab, I’ll test adding a title to my imageby right-clicking on the DOM nodechoosing Add > Attribute, and typing my new title.

I’ll return to the Audit taband run the same test group again.And this time, I see that I pass all the tests.Another great use for audits is checking to make suremy web page meets my own design standards.One of my rules while working on this projectwas to make sure I was consistently usinga small set of font families for all of my elements.Let’s use the new Audit Edit Mode,added to Web Inspector this year, to do just that.I’ll begin editing by clicking on the Edit buttonat the bottom of the Navigation Sidebar.Now I’m in Edit Mode.Here I can create a new test caseusing the Create button at the top of the sidebar.I’ll keep the default option of Test Case,and name my test case "Fonts."I can now edit the rest of my test case.I’ll start by adding a descriptionto help me remember what this test case does.Now let’s insert my actual test code I’ve prepared.

My test will have three main steps.First, I’ll create an array of expected font families.Next, I’ll collect all the elements on my pagewith a font family that isn’t listedin my expected font families.Lastly, I’ll return my result object,including any elements that failed my test.When I’m done writing my audit,I just click Done at the bottom of the Navigation Sidebar.I can now run my audit by clicking the Run buttonnext to its name.It looks like I have an issuewith one of the nodes on my page,so let’s take a look at what's wrong.I can again use the Reveal in Elements Tab buttonto go to the element and look at its style.Well, this is embarrassing.Comic Sans!I really don't want to use this font,so let's change this to the ui-rounded font family instead.

Now, I’ll return to the Audit tab,run my test again, and perfect!The last thing I want to do is export my testusing the Export Audit buttonso that I can share it with my colleaguesto help them avoid the same embarrassing mistake I made --although maybe I’ll leave outthe Comic Sans part of the story.Not only were the built-in accessibility testsable to catch an issue I missed, I was able to write a testto enforce my own design system rules for my web page,making it even easier for teamsto make sure everyone is on the same pagebefore ever checking in their changes.And with that, we’ve covered these big new featuresin Web Inspector!A new overlay for CSS Grid helps make sure your contentlooks just right.Breakpoint improvements make it easier to find, debug,and test fixes for issues without leaving Web Inspector.And with the new audit creating and editingright in Web Inspector,you can quickly create tests to make sure web pagesmeet accessibility standards as well as your own standards.Along with these new features,we’ve made tweaks and enhancementsas well as fixed numerous bugsto further improve Web Inspector.Before I go, there are some helpful resourcesI’d like to leave you with.You may not have realized that Web Inspectoris part of the open source WebKit project,which is the fast, private, and secureweb browser engine used by Safari, Mail, App Store,and many other apps on macOS and iOS.You can learn more about the WebKit project at webkit.org,where you'll also find blog postsabout new features in WebKit,including this one about grid overlays in Web Inspector.In addition to blog posts about new features in Web Inspector,you can also find documentation which coversa wide range of Web Inspector’s features and interface,and goes deep on many of the features we discussed today,like audits and breakpoints.There's so much more depth to those featuresthan I was able to cover today, and I highly recommendchecking out the documentationif you’d like to learn more.We also would love to hear from you!If you come across a bug or have a suggestionon how we can improve Web Inspector,please file feedback for macOS in Feedback Assistant,and select WebKit as the area for your feedback.I’d also like to invite you to downloadSafari Technology Preview,released approximately every two weeks,which is designed specifically for developersto get early access to new WebKit and Web Inspector tools,features, and fixesbefore they appear in the version of Safariincluded on every Mac, iPhone, and iPad.Lastly, please check out these other great sessions,including “Design for Safari 15,”to learn how to adapt and design beautiful content for Safari;and “Develop advanced web content,” to learn all aboutnew JavaScript and WebAssembly featuresyou can use to further enhance your web pages.Also take a look at our session,“What’s new in Web Inspector,” from WWDC 2020to see even more improvements we’ve made in Web Inspector.You can find these fabulous sessions,and many more, in your Developer app.Thank you!♪
