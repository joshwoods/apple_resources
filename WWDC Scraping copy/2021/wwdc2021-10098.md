Search this video…♪ Bass music playing ♪♪David Stites: Hi,and welcome to "Showcase app data in Spotlight".My name is David Stites,and I am an engineer on the Core Data team.In this session, I am excited to show youhow to add Spotlight indexing in your appusing NSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate.The agenda for this session is to learn about theNSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate objectand why you should use it,setup a simple implementation,learn how to customize that implementation,and lastly, validate the code by adding full-text search.First, let's look at Core Data and Spotlight.People are going to create and storea lot of great and important content in your app.As their use of your appand the size of their data set increases,they're going to want to be able to quickly find that databoth inside the app using standard search methodsand outside the app, for example,in Spotlight search.Wouldn't it be great to have data inside your appshow up in Spotlight?Well, this is where Core Data can help you.The NSCoreDataCore SpotlightDelegate objectdoes all the heavy lifting and provides a set of APIsthat quickly and efficiently indexes contentprovided by your app.You just have to turn it on!Once indexed, search results will also appearin the Spotlight search user interface outside your app.The Spotlight delegate automatically processes changesto your graph's managed objectsand then updates the Spotlight index accordingly.In addition, it provides robust index management capabilitiesto interact with the private, on-device-only indexand allows you to tailor the index results to your liking.In fact, any content that is in your persistent storeis eligible to be indexed.The reasons to use the Spotlight delegate are threefold:(1) the Spotlight delegate maintains feature paritywith Core Spotlight APIs,(2) it removes a lot of necessary implementation code,and (3) it provides a great additional feature setthat we'll be discussing later in this session.To illustrate my previous point,this is a very simple implementationusing the Core Spotlight APIs that only adds itemsto a search index and reduces it to... this!Two lines!Simple, easy to read and maintain.I mean, come on, who doesn't prefer less code?Let's take a look at how to get setup and running right away.This simple example will cover deciding what to indexand creating the delegate.Throughout this session, I will be referringto an app called Tags that I wrote for myself,which is a simple photo tagging application.This sample app will incorporate many of the APIsI am discussing today.Prior to adding Spotlight support,you can see that all the tag and photo data is trappedinside Tags as there are no Spotlight search query resultsfor "Natural Bridges State Park".Let's change that!The first step in any implementationusing the NSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegateis to decide what you're going to index in Spotlight.What gets indexed in Spotlight is completely up to you.In Tags, I've decided to indexthe userSpecifiedName attribute on the entity Photoand the name attribute on the entity Tag.To prepare the model for indexing,I've opened the project's Core Data model in Xcode,selected each attribute I want to index,and have ticked the Index in Spotlight checkboxin the attributes inspector.Our work continues in the Core Data model editor,as it's required to setthe Core Data Spotlight display name.The Core Data Spotlight display name is an NSExpression.At indexing time,this expression is evaluated with each managed objectthat has properties indexed by Spotlightand the result is saved.Later, when the Spotlight search user interface is shown,these stored results are used as the “display name”for the search result.What is an NSExpression?Well, an expression can be as simple as evaluating a key path,in this case Tag.name.This object has quite a few more tricks it can dobesides evaluating key paths, however.In this example, it is doing some math for you.The expression can be even more complex,such as calculating the standard deviationof a set of numbers.In Tags, the Spotlight display nameis set to userSpecifiedName on the entity Photo,and name on the entity Tag.Now that the model is prepared for indexing,let's create the Spotlight delegate.Beginning in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey,the initializer forStoreWith: model:is now deprecated.The new way initialize a Spotlight delegateis using forStoreWith: coordinator:.By adopting the new designated initializer,it is no longer required to add an instanceof the Spotlight delegate to the store optionsprior to adding the store to the coordinator.However, you must call startSpotlightIndexingfor the Spotlight delegate to start its work.I want to call out a couple requirementsto using the NSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate.The store type of the store to be indexed must be SQLiteand must have persistent history tracking enabled.And with that, you're done!That's it!You don't need to do anything elseand your data will be indexed in Spotlight.I just demonstrated how easy it is to add Spotlight indexingto my Tags app.Now that I've described the basics,let's customize that implementation a bit.The first way to customize the implementationis by defining a domain and index name.To start off, I'll define a class,TagsSpotlightDelegate, which is a subclass ofNSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate.Now, I'll override domainName and indexNamewith an implementation.Overriding these selectors tells Spotlight where to storethe indexed data and allows you to better identify it later,especially if you have multiple indices.If you do not override domainIdentifier,the default domain identifier is the store identifier.If you do not override indexName,the default index name is nil.The next step in customizing the Spotlight delegateis defining an attribute set.In the setup portion of this session,the NSCoreDataCore SpotlightDelegate objectdefined the attribute set returned to Spotlight for us,simply by ticking the check box Index in Spotlight.Now, I am going to demonstrate exactly how to specifythe attributes that will be used for indexing.Specifying which attributes that should be indexedallows more explicit control over what's indexedand how it's searched for.To do that, use CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.An attribute set contains a number of predefined propertiesallowing you to specify the metadata to displayabout the specified managed objectwhen it appears as a search result.The attributes you choose depend completely on your domain.You can use predefined propertiesavailable in CSSearchableItemAttributeSetor you can define your own properties.The Tags app uses the predefined propertieskeywords, displayName, and thumbnailData.It's important to note that you should only modifyan attribute set on one thread at a timeas concurrent access to the properties in an attribute sethas undefined behavior.Back in the TagsSpotlightDelegate class,let's see how this works by overridingattributeSet (for object:).In the override implementation, begin by determiningif the object is a Photo type object.Next, initialize an attributeSet with the content type .image.Then, set the properties identifier,displayName, and thumbnailData on the attribute setusing the appropriate attributes from the Photo object.Now, append tags from the Photo object tag setto the keywords array on the attribute set.It is worth mentioning at this pointthat if your model indexes a relationship,attributeSet (for object:) must be overriddenso that it defines what about that relationshipin particular is indexed.Lastly, return the attribute set.Since the model is also indexing Tag objects,the code needs to handle the case of a Tag.For that, create an attribute set with the contentType .text,set the display name to the name of the tag,and then return the attribute set.As a last step, remove the Core Data Spotlight display namethat was set in the model editor in a previous step.Let's go further and define an event loopfor starting and stopping indexing.Earlier, when we setup the Spotlight delegate,startSpotlightIndexing was called immediately aftercreating the Spotlight delegate.To give you precise control over when theNSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegateis performing indexing work, stopSpotlightIndexinghas also been added to the framework.Using these two selectors in concert gives you the abilityto start and stop indexing work as necessary,say, in the case where your app is performing intense CPUor disk activity operations.Now, let's add some support for being notifiedwhen index updates complete.When a change occurs to an entity or entitiesthat is indexed in Spotlight,that index is updated asynchronously.In iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, the Core Data frameworkhas added index update notifications.To be informed when the index update is complete, subscribe toNSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate .indexDidUpdateNotification,which is posted by the Spotlight delegate.These notifications will be posted after processinga call to save: on NSManagedObjectContextor after the completion of batch operations.Let's see this in action.First, check to see if indexing is enabled.If it is, then register for the indexDidUpdateNotification.Then, in the handler, inspect the notification,which will have a userInfo dictionarythat contains two key-value pairs,similar to a remote change notification:an NSString UUID of the store that for whichthe Spotlight delegate updated its index,and the persistent history token of the store for whichthe Spotlight delegate updated its index.You can use both of these keys to determineif the store you're interested in has been indexedup to the latest persistent history token.If indexing is not enabled,you can remove yourself as an observerfrom the notifications.Prior to this year, the only way to delete dataindexed by your app was to either implementthe Core Spotlight APIs to remove the index entriesor delete the entire client graph in Core Data.Crucially, new in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey,Core Data has given the developer a new way to managethe Spotlight index without deleting the client graph,which is a great win for user privacy!First, the code will stop indexing.Then, call deleteSpotlightIndex.Lastly, handle any resulting error in the completion handler.Note that calling this method may return errorsfrom lower-layer dependencies,such as Core Data and Core Spotlight,and you should be prepared to handle those.Now that I've shown you how to customize an implementationof the Spotlight delegate,let's validate our setup by adding full-text searchto the Tags app using the Core Spotlight APIs.The results will be what was previously indexed.Start by defining an extension for PhotosViewControllerthat adopts the UISearchResultsUpdating protocoland a functionupdateSearchResults (for controller).The Tags user interface has a UISearchController.We'll get the user inputfrom that search controller's search bar.If the user input is empty,fetch all the images from our data providerand then reload the collection viewas there is no search query.Now let's handle the case where there is a search query.To start, sanitize the user input stringby escaping it.Next, define a query stringusing the user's sanitized input string.Query strings operate on the values associatedwith a property in aCSSearchableItemAttributeSet object.In this case, the code will be operating on theKeywords attribute that was set in a previous step.In the search query, the modifiers c, d, and ware being used.c is for case insensitive.d is for diacritic insensitive.And w is for a word-based search.Now, create a CSSearchQuery object by specifyingthe formatted query string that was just createdand an array of attribute names that correspondto properties defined by CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.This search query object manages the criteriato apply when searching app contentthat you have previously indexedusing the Spotlight delegate APIs.Following that, set the foundItemsHandler.This handler will be called repetitively with itemsthat match the search query previously defined.In the completionHandler for the query,which will be called once, check for an errorand potentially perform some error handling.Absent an error, dispatch a blockonto the main queue to use our data providerto perform a fetch for the items Spotlight foundand load them in the user interface.Lastly, and most importantly, don't forget to start the query.Now that the Tags app has a Spotlight delegateindexing its content,the data has been freed from within the app!When I go to Spotlight, and I search for a tagI have previously added, it returns two results:the tag name itself and the specific photo that I taggedwith the keyword "Natural Bridges State Park".Wrapping up, we've learned about theNSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegateand how it can help your users find their contentinside your app and outside your appin Spotlight search,setup the Spotlight delegate quickly and easilyto start indexing without a huge code burden,and customized our Spotlight delegateusing some of the new APIs available to you this release.I hope you've found this information usefuland that you'll consider adoptingNSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate in your projectto help users find their content.Have a great WWDC!♪
