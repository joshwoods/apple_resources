Search this videoâ€¦Hi, everyone.My name is Kieran, and I'm an Xcode engineerworking on source control technologies.Xcode 13 completely reimagines code review modeand introduces brand new collaboration workflowsto help you improve the quality of your app.In this session, I'll walk you througha typical workflow with our app Fruta.We'll use the new code reviewand pull request features in Xcode 13to find a bug, get feedback,integrate those changes,and provide feedback to my colleagues.Let's get started.A big part of my work is looking into issuesthat our users reported.In order to fix a bug, I first have to understandwhen and why it started happening.By stepping back in time through my code changes,I can often figure out the cause using code review mode.One of the App Store reviews we hadmentioned that some UI changes recently made to our appdon't look quite right.I have a pretty good idea what the issues are,so I'll go ahead and start making some changes.As I start typing,the changes appear in the source editor's gutter.I find it really useful to know what the previous values wereso I can have a good idea of everything that's changed.For this, I can jump into code review mode.Simply click on the Code Review button in the editor barto see the comparison of local editsagainst the most recent revision.As I'm working on my document, code review modecontinuously highlights the edits I'm makingso I always know what's changed since my last commit.When I've made multiple edits to a file,the stepper control in the bottom barshows me how many changes I've made.Clicking the arrow icons will jump between my code changes.That way, I don't have to scroll through the filelooking for the edits myself.Sometimes it can be easierto see what's changed side-by-side,but I prefer to see my changes in-line.Xcode can show me my changes in either style,and I can flip between the twousing the Editor menu at the top right.I want to ensure that I've caught every issuewith the UI bug.To really dig in and understand where a bug came from,I need to see what's changed between releases of my app.I can use the commit controls in the bottom barto set up those comparisons.Xcode 13 allows me to choose commits across my branches,tags, and most recent locationsso I can easily see the changes in my appbetween any two points in time.I usually cut a release branchevery time I submit to TestFlights or the App Store,so I'll take a look at two versions of my coderelated to that release.With my commit selected, Xcode shows me a comparisonof the two historical versions of my document.The highlight colors change to purple and orange,corresponding with the commits displayed in the bottom bar.As before, I can jump between changesusing the stepper control.I can see the comparison either in-line or side-by-side.When I'm done exploring this comparison,I can quickly snap back to my most recent changesusing the Reset button in the bottom bar.Usually, the changes that I make to my appsspan across multiple files.While it's really useful to explore changes within one file,I often want an overviewfor all of the files that I've changed across my whole project.Thanks to the new Changes tab in the Source Control Navigator,I can see a list of all the files I've changedsince my last commit.Clicking on any of themwill automatically enter code review modeand show me all the changes that I've made in that file.I like to flip between the filesto quickly remind myself of the other edits I've made.Now that I know why our app has this issuewhen displaying ingredients,I'll go ahead and create a new branchwith my changes to fix it.Creating and switching branches is something I do a lot,and Xcode 13 has a great new way to do that.Xcode's toolbar now shows my current branch,which is a helpful reminder of what I was last working on.By clicking on it, I can quickly switchbetween any of the branches that I worked on recently.In this case, I'll use the secondary menuto create a branch for my fix.After exploring history in code review mode,I was able to come up with a fix for the bug.Now that I have a proposed solution,I want to get feedback on my code change.Since I'm not totally familiar with this part of the code base,I'd like my teammates to confirmthat my changes won't introduce other issues.To collaborate with my peers on a code change,I'll create a pull request.I can do that right from Xcode 13using its new integrated support for GitHuband Bitbucket Server.I can create my pull requestsright from the source control popover.Xcode will create a draft pull requestto merge with my branchinto the default upstream branch,which in this case is main.I can prepare my pull request with information about the fixbefore publishing it.The changes that I've committed and pushed to my branchwill show up in the Pull Request sectionin the Changes Navigator,giving me a preview of the changes that will be includedonce published.The Local Changes section lets me see filesthat won't be included in my pull requestuntil I commit and push them.When I'm happy with the contents of my pull request,I'll give it a title and a description.I'd like to ask a few teammates in particularto review this change,so I'll click the Participants buttonand tag them as Reviewers.As I wait for feedback and switch to other branches,Xcode figures out which pull request to display.Xcode will determine the associated pull requestbased on its source branch and your current branch.When you switch branches,Xcode will automatically discover existing pull requests.I published my pull request a little while ago,and my team has since left me some feedback.Let's take a look at that now.With the pull request selected in the Changes Navigator,I can see an overview of my pull requestand everything that's happened since I published it.My team has left me some feedback on my code.I can reply to these discussions if I likeor click "View Changes" to jump straight into the filein code review mode.There are some great suggestions in here from Matt,and now we have the opportunityto have this conversation about my pull request in Xcodeand connect it directly to source code.I went ahead and updated my pull requestin response to the feedback.Now, looking at the comments that my teammates have left hereit looks like they're on board with my latest change.I see that my colleague has approved this pull request.Now I just need to check my statusof our continuous integration workflow.Since I'm using Xcode Cloud, I can also see the statusof my continuous integration workflowswithin the pull request's CI popover.I'm able to quickly see a summary of my test results,and clicking on an entrywill jump me straight into a detailed Xcode Cloud report.For more information about Xcode Cloudand running your code in CI,check out the session "Meet Xcode Cloud."OK, since my teammates have all approved my changesand all of my Xcode Cloud jobs have succeeded,I'm ready to merge my pull request.I'll use the Pull Request actions and select "Merge."Xcode allows me to select a merge strategywhich determines how changes are integratedinto the target branch.I'll choose the default, which will include a Merge Commit.You can also enter an optional commit message,but I'll leave it as it is.Everything looks good, so I'll merge it now.Now that I've merged my pull request,it's time to switch back to other work.Just like I find it helpfulto ask my peers for their feedback,they often ask me to review their changes, too.In addition to branches I've worked on recently,the source control popover also shows me the pull requeststhat are relevant to me.I'll see the pull requests that I've created,but Xcode also shows me any pull requeststhat my teammates have requested I review.Looking in the source control popover,it looks like one of my teammateshas asked me to do just that.Let's check out their branch and review it.Just like with my own pull requests,I can see his overview, review status,and discussions on my teammates' pull requestssince I've been tagged in.Let's take a look at their changes.I'll step through the files in the Changes Navigatorunder the pull request node.Clicking on any of these will snap me into code review mode,showing me the changes that will be appliedif the pull request is merged.I can leave a comment for him inside the editorby secondary clickingand inserting a new comment on the line.I think I see a potential improvement in his code,so let's leave a note for my teammate.My feedback was pretty minor,and this pull request looks good to go.I'll approve it using the actions in the top right.Xcode 13 offers great new ways to review codeand collaborate with your peers.Code review mode is a powerful tool for investigating issuesand behavioral changes in your appby giving you insightinto how your app's source code has changed over time.Code review mode also provides you with a newin-line presentation mode and expanded comparison optionsto allow for more flexibility for your workflow.Pull requests allow you to collaborate with your teamto improve your app's code qualityby giving and receiving code feedback on your team's changesbefore merging them into the main branch.Discussions show up right in your app's source code,making teamwork truly part of the development process.Thank you, have a great WWDC, and .[percussive music]
