Search this video…Hello, and welcome to WWDC.My name is Joel, and I would like to tell youabout how you can add music to your apps with MusicKit.MusicKit is a new framework for Apple platformswhich offers expressive APIsfor your apps to access music items in Swift.It leverages the new Swift concurrency syntaxand is designed from the ground up to beused in conjunction with SwiftUI.MusicKit accelerates the way your apps integratewith Apple Music API, which are our setof server-side APIsfor accessing the wide array of catalog contentfrom Apple Music,thus making it much easier for you to build compelling appsthat tie into Apple Music.First, we'll talk about how to request music contentwith MusicKit.Next, we'll talk about other topics that areimportant for the way your apps integrate with Apple Music,such as requesting consent from the user for your app to accessApple Music-related data,managing tokens required for accessing Apple Music API,accessing subscription informationand related capabilities,playing music from the Apple Music catalog,and finally, how to show subscription offersfor Apple Music, in case your user isn't already a subscriber.MusicKit offers a new model layerfor accessing music items,with structured requests that allow you to fetch contentfrom Apple Music API.You can either search for contentin the Apple Music catalog,or fetch resources based on a specific filter.These requests produce responses with itemsgrouped in collections,which have built-in support for pagination,allowing you to get the next batch of itemsfrom an initial response.So, what do these music items look like?Let's take a look at a specific example with an album."Album" is a value type with properties groupedin three different categories.The first category contains simple attributes,such as a string property like "title,"a boolean property like "isCompilation,"or more structured properties like "artwork,"which gives you access to URLs for the artworkalongside relevant sizing information and related colors.Album also offers several relationships,such as related artists or genres,or the list of tracks in a given album.For example, the result of the "tracks" relationshipis a collection of values of type "Track,"which is another type of music item.Finally, in addition to thesestrong model-level relationships,"Album" offers several weaker associationsof related content.Associations are very similar to relationships,but they are typically more ephemeral,or more editorially driven.For example, the "appearsOn" association on an albumreturns a collection of playlists,but, unlike collections for relationships,this one also has a title.Loading and accessing relationshipswith MusicKit is very simple.Given an album, you can easily fetch another representationof this same album that includes relationships like "artists"and "tracks," as well as associationslike "related albums," in a single operation.The "with" method needs to be calledwith the special Swift keyword "await,"which indicates that this will performan asynchronous operation behind the scenes.This will indeed fetch a more complete representationof this album from Apple Music API over the network.You can then get the list of tracksfrom this detailed album,and iterate over those tracks as you would with a regular array.And here's the console output for this code.Accessing associations such as "related albums"works the same way,with the only difference being that they typicallyalso include a title, accessible directly on the collection.You can then iterate over the collection in that same mannerto print a few of those related albums.And here's the console output for this code.Now, let's take a look at a demo of requestingmusic content with MusicKit.I've been working on an app which allows meto find and enjoy albums from Apple Music.I can search for albums using this search field,which is already connected some code to loadmatching search resultsusing the music catalog search request.This app also keeps trackof the list of albums I recently viewed.We can find more information about this album titled"Catch A Vibe - EP" by selecting it,and you may have noticedthe list of tracks for this album being animated inafter this detail view appeared.This is done by loading the "tracks" relationshipof this album as we just saw,and updating the state variable for our SwiftUI view,which is then used to populate this list.We can begin playing music from this album with the play buttonunderneath the artwork,or by selecting a specific track.This will simply use the playback API in MusicKitto set the queue with this list of tracks,and call the play method on the player.Let's try it out!So, if I select the track titled "Catch a Vibe"by Karun & MONBRU...This song begins playing.♪ Ooh, oh, no ♪Our app even works automaticallyin media controls in the Lock screen,which allows me to scrub to a halfway point in this song.But I was hoping to use this app to help me rediscoverold music from my CD library,like this album from Phoenix.So, I'd like to add a feature that would allow meto point the camera of my iPhone to the barcode of an old CDand have this app surface this same album in digital format.I've already added some experimental codefor this feature.When I enable it, I can see a barcode buttonat the bottom,which brings up a camera view.If I point it to the barcode of this CD,it automatically recognizes the barcode value and displays it.All I'm missing is some code that uses MusicKitto find the corresponding album.Let's go ahead and add that to our app.So let me make an albumsRequestusing the MusicCatalogResourceRequest.I am looking specifically for albums.And here, we want to make sure we find albumswhere the UPC property,which stands for Universal Product Code,that's the technical term for bar code,is equalTo: detectedBarcode.I can perform this request asynchronously.albumsRequest.response.And then from the response,I can look for the first albumin the results.Then I can then pass this first albumto the handleDetectedAlbumhelper method down below.handleDetectedAlbum (firstAlbum).This method dismisses the barcode scanning view,and then pushes the album detail view for the detected album.And it's decorated here with MainActorto make sure it will be executed on the main thread.So when we call it, we need to make surethat we add the await keyword.So let's build and run our app again and try it out.Tap the barcode button.Take my album.It worked!Now, it's going to be much easier to enjoymy old music in digital format on Apple Music.MusicKit also offers a general purpose data request,which is different from structured requestsin that it allows you to load contentfrom an arbitrary Apple Music API endpoint using its URL.What you'll get back from this request is the raw datafor the JSON response from Apple Music API.You need to decode this raw data with JSONDecoder,but doing that doesn't have to be hardbecause you can leverage existing music item types,since they conform to the Codable protocol.Let's take a look at an example.If you wanted to load the list of top level genresfrom Apple Music,you could do it by loading contentfrom this specific URL,and here's the corresponding JSON response.If you take a closer look at this result,you can see in the middle what looks like a genre resource.So, how would you represent this in Swift?Sure enough, MusicKit has a Genre type.Zooming back, how would you representthe entire response in Swift?You can create a struct, with a data member,which is a simple array of genres.Then, make sure to mark this struct as Decodable.And this doesn't even require writingany additional decoding logic,because "Genre" itself also conforms to Decodable.So, to load this data in your app,you would put this struct at the top of your file,then you would construct the URL using the specificcountry code for your user.Create a music data request using this URL,and get the response from that,following the same pattern we've already seen.Once you have that response, you can decode its datausing JSONDecoder,by passing in the type MyGenresResponseto the decode method.And that's it!You can now access individual genresin your strongly-typed genres response.And, as you can see, you get the same kind of music itemyou can otherwise fetch from other requests in MusicKit.So, that's how you would load contentfrom any arbitrary URL for Apple Music API.And now that we know how to load music content,let's discuss some important preliminary stepsfor integrating your apps with Apple Music,starting with privacy.We want users to remain in control over which appshave access to their data.So, before you can request any data from Apple Music API,which can include the user's listening historyor their music library,you need to get the user's informed consentfor your app to access Apple Music.Asking for this user content needs to be doneon a per-device and per-app basis.And here's what the user consent dialog looks likein the context of an app named Zova,which is a great fitness appthat allows you to work out with their playlistson Apple Music or your own playlist.When you go to start a workout for the first time,Zova asks for permission to access Apple Music.This dialog needs to convey to the user why your appneeds access to Apple Music.To that end, your app's usage description for Apple Music,which you need to define in your Info.plist,is included as the subtitle of this dialog.Here's an example of how you might request user consentfor MusicKit.Say you have a feature in your appthat requires MusicKit,and that you're gating access to this featureusing the isAuthorizedForMusicKitstate variable.At the appropriate point in your app,before you try to use MusicKit, you can request authorizationto access Apple Music with this asynchronous request method.This will only prompt the user if your apphasn't been authorized yet.The request method returns a status value,and you can set your isAuthorizedForMusicKitvariable to "true" if that status is equal to "authorized."Now, let's talk briefly about tokens requiredfor loading data from Apple Music API.Apple Music API requires a developer token,which essentially authenticates your app with the API.Previously, to get this developer token,you would have had to create a MusicKit private keyin the developer portal,put it on a server under your control,to ensure the key is kept private,and have your app request a new developer tokenfrom your server.But now, with MusicKit for Swift,you no longer need to worry about any of this,as the developer token is automatically generatedfor your app.You just need to opt in to this new automatic behaviorby enrolling in the developer portal.Specifically, in the page where you register your App ID,select the App Services tab at the bottom,and enable the MusicKit checkbox.And you're done!Additionally, Apple Music API requiresa user token for any personalized endpoint.And just like the developer token, new this year,the user token is automatically generated on your behalf.One more thing you may need to use MusicKit in your appis a way to figure out if your user hasan active Apple Music subscription.Subscription information in MusicKit is exposedas three distinct capabilities,which tell you if the user can play contentfrom the Apple Music catalog,if they have iCloud Music Library enabled,or if they can become subscribers,in case they don't already have an active subscription.Make sure to check the relevant capability for the specificApple Music-related functionality in your app.For example, if you have a play buttonhooked up to play some music,you may want to keep it disabled if your usercannot play catalog content from Apple Music.You can define a state variable in your viewto keep track of the music subscription.Then, you can apply the disabled modifier to your buttonto make sure it stays disabledif the music subscription property"canPlayCatalogContent" is set to "false."And finally, inside of an asynchronous blockpassed to the new task modifier,you can use the new subscription updates streamto be notified of changes in the music subscription.Now, let's talk about playback with MusicKit.MusicKit offers two distinct players,which we call SystemMusicPlayer and ApplicationMusicPlayer.Let's get into the differences between those players,starting with an example.Whereas a social media app may want to usethe SystemMusicPlayer to change what's playingout of the system music app,a fitness app might prefer to usethe ApplicationMusicPlayer to keep their playback statecompletely independent from the system music app.Both of these players automatically reportthe now playing information and handle remote commands.This is what gave us deep integrationwith system media controls in the lock screen,earlier in our demo.However, the now-playing app is reported differently.If you use the SystemMusicPlayer,the Music app will be reported as the now-playing app,whereas if you use the ApplicationMusicPlayer,your app will be the one reported as the now-playing app.Ownership of the playback queue is also different.With SystemMusicPlayer, your app is merely remote-controllingthe system Music app, whereas with ApplicationMusicPlayer,your app owns a completely separate playback queue.Both of these players allow you to set the queuewith one or more items,add an item to play next, or to play later.But only the ApplicationMusicPlayergives you additional control over the playback queue,allowing you to insert items in the middle,or removing items that had been added previously.Finally, if your user isn't alreadyan Apple Music subscriber,you may want to allow them to start a free trialfor Apple Music from within your app,so they'll be able to enjoy all the functionalityyou've worked on to improve the user experienceof your app with music.The subscription offer can be configured by tailoringthe main message shown to the user to better correspondto the functionality in your app, like “play music”.It can also be contextual,highlighting a specific song, album, or a playlist.And by using the subscription offer sheet in your app,you can get rewarded for bringing innew Apple Music subscribers,through our affiliate program,which we call the Apple ServicesPerformance Partners Program.To show a contextual music subscription offerin your app, you'll need to keep trackof the music subscription as we saw earlier.You'll also need another state variableto keep track of whether the offer is being shown.Pass in the ID of, say, an album,as the itemID property of your subscription offer options.Keep the offer button disabled whenever “canBecomeSubscriber”is set to "false" on the music subscription.Then, use the musicSubscriptionOffer modifierwith a binding to the isShowingOffer property,and also including your options.Finally, set the isShowingOffer variable to "true."Let's go back to our app and see whatthe contextual offer for Apple Music looks like.In our earlier demo, we were already signed inwith an active Apple Music subscription.So, to simulate the scenario where it might be appropriateto show a subscription offer for Apple Music,you can just go Settings,and sign out of your account.Then, if I go back to my app, you can see that the play buttonwas disabled and moved to the left to make roomfor another button that invites the user to join Apple Music.If I tap this button, a subscription offeris presented, highlighting the specific albumwe were just looking at in our app.And that's how you can allowusers to start a free trialfor Apple Musicfrom within your app.In conclusion, there are many types of appsthat can be enhanced by adding a little bit of musicas part of their experience.For example, you can make your games a lot more immersiveby playing background music that matches the mood of your game.Or you can play upbeat musicto keep your users motivated in a fitness app.And in a social media app, you can keep your userseven more engaged with content that highlights music.To go even further, make sure to check outsome related sessions, so you can learn aboutharnessing the power of Shazam signatures with ShazamKit,and dive deeper into concurrency with SwiftUI.Thanks for watching, and enjoy WWDC 2021![percussive music]

This method dismisses the barcode scanning view,and then pushes the album detail view for the detected album.

And it's decorated here with MainActorto make sure it will be executed on the main thread.So when we call it, we need to make surethat we add the await keyword.
