Accessibility by design: An Apple Watch for everyone

Wednesday@WWDC21

Search this video…♪ ♪So our goals have always beento build great accessibility into all of our productsbecause many of us navigate our livesin different ways.At Apple, we like to thinkof accessibility touching four different broad categories--vision, cognitive, motor, and hearing.And we look at all those segmentsand try to think about how they impact each product.Are we doing something in this areawhere we should have a different accommodation?Do we have something that we needa special assistive technology to provide a different wayto interact with this device?How do we make the whole world accessible?Every day, we're thinkingabout accessibility.We care because they push the boundariesof the experience in a way that we can't imagine.If you can createnot just a good accessibility experience,but a great accessibility experience,you'll have a fan for life.The Watch is a unique kind of computing platform.It's very personal. It touches your skin.It also has a long history of what its use is for,and what its functions are.To make it something accessible, you really wanna look at--what is the product supposed to do?What is its core mission of what thisis gonna bring value for?So when you look at that for the Watch,that's when we start to realize, like, all right, how do we makethis more accessible for someone who's blind?What do we do for someone who's low-vision?And how do we do it on a CPUthe size of a postage stamp?Apple developed this product,and the primary focus was to be able to read the time,and so the contrast with the black backgroundwith the legible letters was very important.Well, it turns out that was also importantfor low-vision users,and it's great for the person who needs that accessibility,but it also turns out to be useful for everyone else.So one of the great thingsabout making a product accessible by designis that you do things that you may not thinkare necessary, and I'm reminded of a storyof a woman that I met who had Usher syndrome.So she came to us and said, "You know, what's really greatabout the Watch is that I can read the emailon this really small screen because all my visionis focused in this central area.It's actually better than having a big screen."When you sort of invest in accessibility,you have to look at things from a different perspective,and so that often leads to featuresthat become mainstream over time,and I think the Apple Watch is a great exampleof showing a lot of those things,from the large-type watch face which was designedfor low-vision users but it's available for everybody.Part of the thing about making the Watch accessibleis what is the primary function?One of those things was telling the time quickly,and sometimes discreetly, so that's where Taptic Timecame into play, which is a featurethat we have that allows a user to feel out the timeusing the haptics played back to them.When we were testing, one of the thingsthat I noticed right away sort of walking aroundand using the device, if I was mobile,I had to take one hand off of my cane,stop, and then touch my device.And I thought, "Well, that could be very dangerous, right?"So one of the things I thought is, "Man,it would be really great if I could-just raise my hand..." - 1:04 p.m.- And hear the time, and then I don't haveto stop or jeopardize my safety.1:09 p.m.That's a very, very simple solution,but it solves a very, very important problem.But we've learned that there's more to accessibilitythan pure technology solutions.So the Mickey Mouse watch face,when it was introduced, I thinkit really surprised everybody, especially because iteven had some really neat little featureslike Mickey's tapping his foot, but to a low-visionor blind audience, if I touched the watch,all I would get is a description,or maybe, perhaps, the timespoken by the same text-to-speechI hear everywhere else on the watch face,and that's just not good enough.I remember I was in a presentation,and I was sitting in the back row behind someone,and they were talking about the Mickey Mouse watch face,and I heard a woman in front of me say,"Oh, I just really wish I could hear Mickey speak."And I turned to the engineer who was there with me.I said, "We gotta do something about this."It's 9:41.And we started to look into this.Why can't we just ask Disney to work with usto make some of these voices?Disney actually said,"Yeah, let's work on this."Well, not only was it going to be recorded in English,but it was going to be recorded in more than 30 languages.Buongiorno!--- The feedback after we demonstrated our prototype,it wasn't about is this going to bea great accessibility feature?What we actually got was "Can everybody have this?"Wow, okay!But the hardest question was figuring outhow often should Mickey laugh?- One. One is just not enough.Three is not enough.No, we need all the laughs.But for a sighted user using it,they may not want to hear that as much,so we ended with two different standards.When VoiceOver is on, Mickey laughs more often.When VoiceOver is not on,Mickey doesn't laugh quite as much.I remember reading to my kids at night,and they would reach overand just tap on the Mickey watch faceover and over again to hear him speak.And those are really fun times.To work on something that, you know,is for one community, but it's so coolthat it ends up affecting everybody.It's about bringing to light for a characterthat people have loved for nearly a century.So one of the-- you know,the jobs of being a developer,and especially in accessibility, is to know the landscapeof the technology so that you can usethese things and solve the problemsin new, unique ways.So oftentimes we hear these stories that people saythey love their Watch, but it can be awkward to use,and that's because I don't have an armor another hand to touch the watch with.When we started trying to meet this needfor our users, we thought,"Well, we have this very smart Watch,and it's on your wrist.So could we create a completely gesture-basedhuman-to-computer interaction?"And we started off with these more--more sort of, like, gross gestures.Lift your arm. Twist your wrist.And we quickly learnedthat we needed the gesture that would expendthe least amount of energy,and we started with just this pinch gesture,which is pretty low impact.And so we started to play around and say,"Well, there's some signal here.What if we combine the accelerometer,the gyroscope, and some of those health sensorsthat detect heart rate, and use that to detectsubtle muscle movements in your arm?Combine that together,put it into a machine-learning modelto distinguish just these sort of very minute differences,and see what we got out of that."- We have a colleague who has low muscle tonein his arms, and so, he was instrumentalin testing and really narrowing down the gestures.So we discovered that we can use,for simple gestures, pinch, double pinch, clench,and double clenchfor complete access to the Apple Watch.♪ ♪Hey, I can't talk right now.I mean, this is the kind of stuffthat you couldn't even imagine a few years ago.I mean, we're talking aboutreal sci-fi kind of things right now.Apple Watch is uniquely suitedto really meet this need for our users.The interface itself is designed for focused interactions.We worked really closely with our font designersto add a glyph language to SF Symbolsthat basically represents all of the hardwareand software inputs of the Apple Watch.Then, you have an accelerometer. We can detect your blood flow.You have a gyroscope.So all of these sensors on the Watch allow usto detect even these very minuscule gestures.I can't wait to hear how this featureis a game-changer for people.I can't wait to see what developersare going to do with this new technology.So accessibility is incredibly importantbecause it creates equity for the world.It allows people to be independent,to have a sense of control over their life,their environment, things they would like to do,passions they have.Accessibility is really about allowing more peopleto use your thing, that we're gonna make roomthat everybody can use it to the best of their abilities.So why wouldn't you want more people to use your product?Why wouldn't you want to make it better for everyone?To me, that sort of gets to the heart of why we getinto this from the beginning.Why do we love programming so much and developing so much?It's so people can use our stuff.I wish developersknew that doing accessibility within their appsreally provides a warm, comforting feeling for users.It's unexplainable.You work really hard on something, on an idea,on a concept, and then you see it come into place,and then, even better, you see how it impacts someone's life.And there's just no feeling like that.You just feel like the world is great againbecause you've solved the problem.[upbeat music]
