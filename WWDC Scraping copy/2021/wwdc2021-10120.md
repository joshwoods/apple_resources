Search this video…♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Sommer Panage: Hi, my name is Sommer Panage.I'm excited to talk to you todayabout Full Keyboard Access on iOS.Full Keyboard Access is a featurefor our customers with motor impairments.So to begin today,I'll be giving you a quick overviewof motor accessibility in general on iOS.After that, we'll take a closer lookat Full Keyboard Accessand all the power it brings users,particularly on iPad.And finally, we'll dive into key APIs and principlesthat you as a developer should be sure to keep in mindas you build your applicationsto be certain that they support keyboard users.Now, let's get started with a review of motor accessibility.When we discuss developing accessible apps for iOS,we want to keep all users in mind.We often talk about accessibilityin terms of VoiceOver,a technology for those who are blind or low vision.However, it's important to also make sureour software works for anyone with motor impairments as well.Motor impairment is a wide-ranging termand can impact how someone uses their iOS device in many ways.Some people may have a limited range of motion.Others may have finer motor impairmentssuch as tremors or other difficultiestouching the screen.And depending on the severity of the motor impairment,many people find it easier or even necessaryto interact with their devices via external hardwaresuch as keyboards, joysticks, or buttons.iOS provides numerous assistive technologiesto help those with motor impairmentshave a seamless experience with their devices.For example, we offer AssistiveTouchfor people who might have some difficultywith hardware interactions or Multi-Touch gestures.AssistiveTouch uses an onscreen menuto simplify these interactions down to simple single taps.Switch Control allows those with more limited motor abilitiesto interact with their iOS devicesusing one or more external switches or buttons.And of course, there's also Voice Control,which allows people to interact with their iOS devicesusing only their voice.And that brings us to one of our newest motor technologies,Full Keyboard Access.While iOS has offered support for keyboards since iOS 9,it's been a supplementary mode of input.With Full Keyboard Access, released in iOS 13.4.1,customers can now interact with their device100 percent via the keyboard.It's a middle groundbetween AssistiveTouch and Switch Controlfor those who may not have enough dexterityto touch their screensbut who also do not necessarily need or wantto use external switches.It also offers an alternative to Voice Controlfor those who may be nonverbal, have a speech impairment,or who simply might be in an environmentwhere using Voice Control doesn't make sense.Full Keyboard Access is also greatfor those who depend on custom or accessible keyboard layoutssuch as a one-handed keyboardor this ergonomic split keyboard here.In order for Full Keyboard Accessto offer people a true iOS experiencewithout the touchscreen,it provides numerous additions to basic keyboard input.Full Keyboard Access also has navigation commandsso that users can get to every single element onscreen,interaction commands,and a Gesture mode for things like drag and drop.And all of these commands use Tab as the modifier key.However, they're also fully customizablefor people who may prefer different key combos.So let's take a look at how a user might navigateon their iPad using Full Keyboard Access.So first, I can use the arrow keysto move to the Notes app and Space bar to activate.From there, I can Tab over to create a new noteand then I can immediately edit.I think I'm going to take some notes about version twofrom one of my apps called Shape Shuffle.Let's make it great for iPad.When I'm done editing,I can use Control-Tab to get out of editing mode.Now if I want to delete an old note,I can use Tab-Z to bring up a list of actions.Then I can use arrow and Space to delete the note.Now, let's say I want to make one more new note.Well, I could Tab over to the Create Note button again,or I could use the Find feature by using Tab-F.Then I just type in "new", and there we go.So now that you know all about Full Keyboard Accessand how it's used,it's time to look into how you, as an app developer,can make sure that keyboard usershave the best possible experience.In 2020, I talked with you about Switch Control,and we worked on this fun game for kidsto learn their shapes, colors, and numbers.Together, we made this app accessible.This year, I decided to rev Shape Shuffle for iPadso that we can make sure that it works greatwith Full Keyboard Access.If you haven't seen Shape Shuffle yet, no worries.Here's a quick tour.In each level, the player gets a promptlike the one we see here: Two Yellow Squares.Then they have to tap through the cards belowto try to find the three required cards;in this case, a card with two objects,a square card, and a yellow card.Once they've double-tapped each correct card,they can move on to the next level.And as the levels go up, the prompts get harder.It looks like I just found two,so I can double-tap to add it to my boardand continue searching for yellow and square.Now, if I'm not sure if the card is the right one or not,I can put a pin in it by long-pressing itso I know to come back later.I'll put a pin in these two in the bottom left.Then, when I return, I can make my final pickand beat the level.Hm... I got it!Now let's start with our gameplay viewto see how things work when I play another roundbut this time via my keyboard.So as I hit Tab and Space bar, things seem to be working well.I can move between cards with Taband flip them with Space.Now let's try to add or pin our triangle card.I'll hit Tab-Z to bring up my Actions menu,but I'm not seeing any actions available.Now, there are actually two ways we can address helping usersto quickly get to common actions in our game, like add and pin.The first way we can solve this is via a custom action.Custom actions are greatbecause they translate across many assistive technologies.When you add custom actions to something,it will show up in VoiceOver, Switch Control,and Full Keyboard Access.Custom actions are what show up when you hit Tab-Z.As you can see here,all I need to do is create a UIAccessibilityCustomActionfor the actions I want to add, then go ahead and set thoseto my accessibilityCustomActions array on my cardView.Also, it's always great to add an image.While these images won't show up for Full Keyboard Access,they will show up for Switch Control.Here's what my UI looks like with custom actions added.When I press Tab-Z,I see this nice popover letting me add the card or pin it.Custom actions are greatfor anyone using our accessibility features;however, there's another really cool approachthat you can take here.You can add a custom keyboard shortcut.The nice thing with a custom keyboard shortcutis that it will work for both your Full Keyboard Access usersas well as for those who are just using a keyboardwith their device,but they don't have Full Keyboard Access turned on.It's great for accessibility and power users alike.To see a list of keyboard shortcuts,you just need to hold down the Command key.You can learn all about keyboard shortcutsand much more for iPad in our talk this year,"Take your iPad apps to the next level."Today, I'll show you a short exampleof how you can harness this API which was new in Mac Catalyst 13and now brought to iOS and iPadOS 15.By overriding buildMenu in your AppDelegate,you can set your key commandsHere I create two UIKeyCommands;one for my add action and one for my pin action.I make sure to add a discoverability titleas that's what will show up in my KeyCommand HUDwhen I hold down Command.Next, I create a new UI menu, which I name "gameplay",and I pass the new commands as "children".Finally, I insert the menu into my menu builder,and I'm done!Now, since I only want these items to be active in the HUDwhen I actually have a selected card,I also override canPerformAction on my GameViewControllerso that I only show these itemswhen a card is actually selected.Here's what our game looks likewhen I hold down the Command key,and I have a card selected.And here, I want to highlight a key principleof developing for Full Keyboard Access.You should try to add custom actionsand keyboard shortcuts to all of your common actionsto improve efficiency for your users.Not only are they both easily discoverable,but they improve the experience for anyoneinteracting with your app via a keyboard.Let's come back to our game.I've added the triangle with my new actions.Now I'll use Shift-Tabto go back toward the home button.However, as I'm doing that, I see another issue.That triangle is selectableeven though when I tap on it with Space bar nothing happens.So first of all, why is our cursor going to this elementif we can't interact with it?Well, I've already done some VoiceOver support workon this app, and here's what that looks like.You'll see that I'm setting isAccessibilityElement to trueon my items as well as giving it an accessibilityLabel.This is great because VoiceOver needs to read each itemto our user.However, if someone is a Full Keyboard Access user only,then their cursor will also go to many itemsmarked with isAccessibilityElement.In order to tell Full Keyboard Access to skip this element,we need to add one more line.Here, you can see that we setaccessibilityResponds ToUserInteraction to false.This tells our systemthat while this is an accessibility element,it's not one that the user can interact with.So the cursor for motor technologiessuch as Full Keyboard Access or Switch Control should skip it.Note that accessibility RespondsToUserInteractionis only meaningful if isAccessibilityElementis already true.By default, the system tries to correctly set elementswith isAccessibilityElement true to interactive or not.In most cases you'll only need to setaccessibilityResponds ToUserInteraction to falsewhen you have an object that you want to be accessibleto VoiceOver but not to Full Keyboard Accessor other motor technologies.This brings us to a second key principleof developing for Full Keyboard Access.As you're testing your app,you'll want to be sure that the cursor only goesto items that the user can interact with.Now, as you're building your appand making sure focus only goes to the right places,it might be tempting to override canBecomeFocusedinstead of the API that we just discussed.However, this overrides focus behaviorfor the whole focus engineand will impact people using Tab to navigatewhen Full Keyboard Access isn't even on.So it's best to steer clear of this when only wantingto modify behavior for Full Keyboard Access users.In fact, this brings up an important area.The focus system that's used to drive Full Keyboard Accessis the same one that drives Tab navigationacross all of our OSs like iPadOS.While you likely won't need to touch itin order to work with Full Keyboard Access,if you'd like to learn more, I recommend these three talks.This year we have two other talks called"Focus on iPad keyboard navigation"and "Direct and reflect focus in SwiftUI."And back in 2017, there's a fantastic talkall about how the focus engine drives tvOS.Now, coming back to our home screen,I want to be sure that I can useFull Keyboard Access's awesome Find feature.So let's give it a try.OK, the number levels work great out of the box.Searching for levels eight and twelve is easy.And because I've already added some VoiceOver support,I'm getting the Settings button, too, with Find.But what happens if I don't knowthat the button is called Settings?Maybe I type in "preferences" or "prefs."Hm. No luck.To solve this, we can set an array of stringsto our accessibilityUserInputLabels.Here, I'm setting the localized words for prefs,preferences, gear, and settings to this labelto be sure that people can reach itno matter what they might type.By adding these strings,you'll also be doing a favor to your Voice Control users,as they can now speak any of these namesto tap your Settings button as well.Of course, this won't interfere with your VoiceOver label.So now when you type in "prefs" it works great!And this brings me to our third and final principle today.Make sure that you always provide as many labelsas you can for your image-based controlsso your users can always get to them quickly with Find.Now, before we finish up,I want to do a little fun polish.So let's take one more look at my home screen.Since all these items are UI buttons,Tab is moving to them naturally.And that's great.But notice how my cursor is always a rectangle?To make things more playful,let's make it match the shapes of the buttons.To show nice cursor shapes around our buttons,we can just use accessibilityPath --the same accessibilityPath, in fact,that you'd use for VoiceOver.For static views, you can set the accessibilityPathto that of the shape itself with a UIBezierPath.Notice that I'm setting the accessibilityPathin screen coordinates.If you're in a scroll view,you'll want to override accessibilityPathso it's always correct relative to screen coordinates,even when you're scrolling.Let's take a look at how fun this bit of polish looks.Now as I Tab through, we can see circles,triangles, and squares.And it'll be the same with VoiceOver as well.With that, let's review some of the key ideas to keep in mindwhen you're developing your app for keyboards,but particularly, for Full Keyboard Access.First, use custom actions and keyboard shortcutsto really go that extra mile,adding efficient means to navigate your apps.Next, make sure the cursor doesn't land on itemsthat the user cannot actually interact with.And finally, be sure that you add user input labels,especially on image-based controls,so that people can take full advantageof Full Keyboard Access's Find feature.And that's everything!I hope that today you now understand the importanceof motor accessibility in all of Apple's products.While there are numerous ways of interacting with our devices,the keyboard has become a powerful tool for our users.With the information from this talk,you should now be able to be certain your apps providean excellent experience to Full Keyboard Access usersand to everyone.Thank you and have an amazing WWDC 2021.♪

♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Sommer Panage: Hi, my name is Sommer Panage.

I'm excited to talk to you todayabout Full Keyboard Access on iOS.

Full Keyboard Access is a featurefor our customers with motor impairments.

So to begin today,I'll be giving you a quick overviewof motor accessibility in general on iOS.

After that, we'll take a closer lookat Full Keyboard Accessand all the power it brings users,particularly on iPad.

And finally, we'll dive into key APIs and principlesthat you as a developer should be sure to keep in mindas you build your applicationsto be certain that they support keyboard users.

Now, let's get started with a review of motor accessibility.

When we discuss developing accessible apps for iOS,we want to keep all users in mind.

We often talk about accessibilityin terms of VoiceOver,a technology for those who are blind or low vision.

However, it's important to also make sureour software works for anyone with motor impairments as well.

Motor impairment is a wide-ranging termand can impact how someone uses their iOS device in many ways.

Some people may have a limited range of motion.

Others may have finer motor impairmentssuch as tremors or other difficultiestouching the screen.

And depending on the severity of the motor impairment,many people find it easier or even necessaryto interact with their devices via external hardwaresuch as keyboards, joysticks, or buttons.

iOS provides numerous assistive technologiesto help those with motor impairmentshave a seamless experience with their devices.

For example, we offer AssistiveTouchfor people who might have some difficultywith hardware interactions or Multi-Touch gestures.

AssistiveTouch uses an onscreen menuto simplify these interactions down to simple single taps.

Switch Control allows those with more limited motor abilitiesto interact with their iOS devicesusing one or more external switches or buttons.

And of course, there's also Voice Control,which allows people to interact with their iOS devicesusing only their voice.

And that brings us to one of our newest motor technologies,Full Keyboard Access.

While iOS has offered support for keyboards since iOS 9,it's been a supplementary mode of input.

With Full Keyboard Access, released in iOS 13.4.1,customers can now interact with their device100 percent via the keyboard.

It's a middle groundbetween AssistiveTouch and Switch Controlfor those who may not have enough dexterityto touch their screensbut who also do not necessarily need or wantto use external switches.

It also offers an alternative to Voice Controlfor those who may be nonverbal, have a speech impairment,or who simply might be in an environmentwhere using Voice Control doesn't make sense.

Full Keyboard Access is also greatfor those who depend on custom or accessible keyboard layoutssuch as a one-handed keyboardor this ergonomic split keyboard here.

In order for Full Keyboard Accessto offer people a true iOS experiencewithout the touchscreen,it provides numerous additions to basic keyboard input.

Full Keyboard Access also has navigation commandsso that users can get to every single element onscreen,interaction commands,and a Gesture mode for things like drag and drop.

And all of these commands use Tab as the modifier key.

However, they're also fully customizablefor people who may prefer different key combos.

So let's take a look at how a user might navigateon their iPad using Full Keyboard Access.

So first, I can use the arrow keysto move to the Notes app and Space bar to activate.

From there, I can Tab over to create a new noteand then I can immediately edit.

I think I'm going to take some notes about version twofrom one of my apps called Shape Shuffle.

Let's make it great for iPad.

When I'm done editing,I can use Control-Tab to get out of editing mode.

Now if I want to delete an old note,I can use Tab-Z to bring up a list of actions.

Then I can use arrow and Space to delete the note.

Now, let's say I want to make one more new note.

Well, I could Tab over to the Create Note button again,or I could use the Find feature by using Tab-F.

Then I just type in "new", and there we go.

So now that you know all about Full Keyboard Accessand how it's used,it's time to look into how you, as an app developer,can make sure that keyboard usershave the best possible experience.

In 2020, I talked with you about Switch Control,and we worked on this fun game for kidsto learn their shapes, colors, and numbers.

Together, we made this app accessible.

This year, I decided to rev Shape Shuffle for iPadso that we can make sure that it works greatwith Full Keyboard Access.

If you haven't seen Shape Shuffle yet, no worries.

Here's a quick tour.

In each level, the player gets a promptlike the one we see here: Two Yellow Squares.

Then they have to tap through the cards belowto try to find the three required cards;in this case, a card with two objects,a square card, and a yellow card.

Once they've double-tapped each correct card,they can move on to the next level.

And as the levels go up, the prompts get harder.

It looks like I just found two,so I can double-tap to add it to my boardand continue searching for yellow and square.

Now, if I'm not sure if the card is the right one or not,I can put a pin in it by long-pressing itso I know to come back later.

I'll put a pin in these two in the bottom left.

Then, when I return, I can make my final pickand beat the level.

Hm... I got it!Now let's start with our gameplay viewto see how things work when I play another roundbut this time via my keyboard.

So as I hit Tab and Space bar, things seem to be working well.

I can move between cards with Taband flip them with Space.

Now let's try to add or pin our triangle card.

I'll hit Tab-Z to bring up my Actions menu,but I'm not seeing any actions available.

Now, there are actually two ways we can address helping usersto quickly get to common actions in our game, like add and pin.

The first way we can solve this is via a custom action.

Custom actions are greatbecause they translate across many assistive technologies.

When you add custom actions to something,it will show up in VoiceOver, Switch Control,and Full Keyboard Access.

Custom actions are what show up when you hit Tab-Z.

As you can see here,all I need to do is create a UIAccessibilityCustomActionfor the actions I want to add, then go ahead and set thoseto my accessibilityCustomActions array on my cardView.

Also, it's always great to add an image.

While these images won't show up for Full Keyboard Access,they will show up for Switch Control.

Here's what my UI looks like with custom actions added.

When I press Tab-Z,I see this nice popover letting me add the card or pin it.

Custom actions are greatfor anyone using our accessibility features;however, there's another really cool approachthat you can take here.

You can add a custom keyboard shortcut.

The nice thing with a custom keyboard shortcutis that it will work for both your Full Keyboard Access usersas well as for those who are just using a keyboardwith their device,but they don't have Full Keyboard Access turned on.

It's great for accessibility and power users alike.

To see a list of keyboard shortcuts,you just need to hold down the Command key.

You can learn all about keyboard shortcutsand much more for iPad in our talk this year,"Take your iPad apps to the next level."Today, I'll show you a short exampleof how you can harness this API which was new in Mac Catalyst 13and now brought to iOS and iPadOS 15.

By overriding buildMenu in your AppDelegate,you can set your key commandsHere I create two UIKeyCommands;one for my add action and one for my pin action.

I make sure to add a discoverability titleas that's what will show up in my KeyCommand HUDwhen I hold down Command.

Next, I create a new UI menu, which I name "gameplay",and I pass the new commands as "children".

Finally, I insert the menu into my menu builder,and I'm done!Now, since I only want these items to be active in the HUDwhen I actually have a selected card,I also override canPerformAction on my GameViewControllerso that I only show these itemswhen a card is actually selected.

Here's what our game looks likewhen I hold down the Command key,and I have a card selected.

And here, I want to highlight a key principleof developing for Full Keyboard Access.

You should try to add custom actionsand keyboard shortcuts to all of your common actionsto improve efficiency for your users.

Not only are they both easily discoverable,but they improve the experience for anyoneinteracting with your app via a keyboard.

Let's come back to our game.

I've added the triangle with my new actions.

Now I'll use Shift-Tabto go back toward the home button.

However, as I'm doing that, I see another issue.

That triangle is selectableeven though when I tap on it with Space bar nothing happens.

So first of all, why is our cursor going to this elementif we can't interact with it?Well, I've already done some VoiceOver support workon this app, and here's what that looks like.

You'll see that I'm setting isAccessibilityElement to trueon my items as well as giving it an accessibilityLabel.

This is great because VoiceOver needs to read each itemto our user.

However, if someone is a Full Keyboard Access user only,then their cursor will also go to many itemsmarked with isAccessibilityElement.

In order to tell Full Keyboard Access to skip this element,we need to add one more line.

Here, you can see that we setaccessibilityResponds ToUserInteraction to false.

This tells our systemthat while this is an accessibility element,it's not one that the user can interact with.

So the cursor for motor technologiessuch as Full Keyboard Access or Switch Control should skip it.

Note that accessibility RespondsToUserInteractionis only meaningful if isAccessibilityElementis already true.

By default, the system tries to correctly set elementswith isAccessibilityElement true to interactive or not.

In most cases you'll only need to setaccessibilityResponds ToUserInteraction to falsewhen you have an object that you want to be accessibleto VoiceOver but not to Full Keyboard Accessor other motor technologies.

This brings us to a second key principleof developing for Full Keyboard Access.

As you're testing your app,you'll want to be sure that the cursor only goesto items that the user can interact with.

Now, as you're building your appand making sure focus only goes to the right places,it might be tempting to override canBecomeFocusedinstead of the API that we just discussed.

However, this overrides focus behaviorfor the whole focus engineand will impact people using Tab to navigatewhen Full Keyboard Access isn't even on.

So it's best to steer clear of this when only wantingto modify behavior for Full Keyboard Access users.

In fact, this brings up an important area.

The focus system that's used to drive Full Keyboard Accessis the same one that drives Tab navigationacross all of our OSs like iPadOS.

While you likely won't need to touch itin order to work with Full Keyboard Access,if you'd like to learn more, I recommend these three talks.

This year we have two other talks called"Focus on iPad keyboard navigation"and "Direct and reflect focus in SwiftUI."And back in 2017, there's a fantastic talkall about how the focus engine drives tvOS.

Now, coming back to our home screen,I want to be sure that I can useFull Keyboard Access's awesome Find feature.

So let's give it a try.

OK, the number levels work great out of the box.

Searching for levels eight and twelve is easy.

And because I've already added some VoiceOver support,I'm getting the Settings button, too, with Find.

But what happens if I don't knowthat the button is called Settings?Maybe I type in "preferences" or "prefs."Hm. No luck.

To solve this, we can set an array of stringsto our accessibilityUserInputLabels.

Here, I'm setting the localized words for prefs,preferences, gear, and settings to this labelto be sure that people can reach itno matter what they might type.

By adding these strings,you'll also be doing a favor to your Voice Control users,as they can now speak any of these namesto tap your Settings button as well.

Of course, this won't interfere with your VoiceOver label.

So now when you type in "prefs" it works great!And this brings me to our third and final principle today.

Make sure that you always provide as many labelsas you can for your image-based controlsso your users can always get to them quickly with Find.

Now, before we finish up,I want to do a little fun polish.

So let's take one more look at my home screen.

Since all these items are UI buttons,Tab is moving to them naturally.

And that's great.

But notice how my cursor is always a rectangle?To make things more playful,let's make it match the shapes of the buttons.

To show nice cursor shapes around our buttons,we can just use accessibilityPath --the same accessibilityPath, in fact,that you'd use for VoiceOver.

For static views, you can set the accessibilityPathto that of the shape itself with a UIBezierPath.

Notice that I'm setting the accessibilityPathin screen coordinates.

If you're in a scroll view,you'll want to override accessibilityPathso it's always correct relative to screen coordinates,even when you're scrolling.

Let's take a look at how fun this bit of polish looks.

Now as I Tab through, we can see circles,triangles, and squares.

And it'll be the same with VoiceOver as well.

With that, let's review some of the key ideas to keep in mindwhen you're developing your app for keyboards,but particularly, for Full Keyboard Access.

First, use custom actions and keyboard shortcutsto really go that extra mile,adding efficient means to navigate your apps.

Next, make sure the cursor doesn't land on itemsthat the user cannot actually interact with.

And finally, be sure that you add user input labels,especially on image-based controls,so that people can take full advantageof Full Keyboard Access's Find feature.

And that's everything!I hope that today you now understand the importanceof motor accessibility in all of Apple's products.

While there are numerous ways of interacting with our devices,the keyboard has become a powerful tool for our users.

With the information from this talk,you should now be able to be certain your apps providean excellent experience to Full Keyboard Access usersand to everyone.

Thank you and have an amazing WWDC 2021.
