through the exciting featureswe've added this year for Matter support.As mentioned in Monday's keynote,Matter is a new standard for smart home accessoriesbeing developed by Apple and other industry leadersto ensure that all smart home accessories work togetherseamlessly moving forward.Its vision is to democratize home automation worldwide,making it possible for people to begin building smart homes,and then continue adding to them for years to come.The Matter protocol is being developedas an open source effortwhich leverages proven technologies, including HomeKit,ensuring that it will support the broadest amountof smart home devices,and then make it easy for manufacturers to beginintegrating it into their products.Using Matter, smart home accessory manufacturersno longer need to support multiple protocols in parallel,truly simplifying the development effortof making a product and supporting it on an ongoing basis.It also gives app developers an opportunityto focus on developing the best app experiencefor their customers,without the burden to create and then maintainproprietary protocols.By creating such a unified protocol for accessories,customers can easily enjoy the conveniences of a smart homeand then confidently bring products into their homes,knowing they will all work together.It will enable more accessories for peopleto choose from in stores,and then builders everywhere will be able to install themas standard into homes.Motivated by these, we would love our developersto be able to use Matter the soonestin your accessory and app development.We're glad to let you know that the support for Matter is comingin iOS, iPadOS, and in tvOS 15 as a developer preview.There are many great features that we wouldlike to introduce to you today.First and then foremost, let's talk about howyou can integrate with Matter accessories via HomeKit.Today, an accessory implementing the HomeKit Accessory Protocolintegrates with Apple Home via the HomeKit framework.Over the years, we have built great featureson top of HomeKit that provides full controland then management of HAP accessories.When we look at integrating Matter accessorieswith Apple Home, we naturally came to the conclusion that wecould expand the responsibility of the HomeKit frameworkto support Matter as a parallel protocol.Architecturally, this means that a HomeKit calls intothe open source Matter implementation,as known as CHIP framework,in order to communicate with Matter accessories.For your context, the earlier name for the Matter projectwas Connected Home over IP, or, in short, CHIP.That's why, throughout today's talk,you will still see the reference of CHIP,both in the open source project and our APIs.We expect to have updated naming for the APIs in a later release.Back to our main topic, the encapsulation providedby HomeKit allows all existing Apple Home features to beginworking with Matter accessories seamlessly and immediately.For example, setting up a Matter accessory using identicalflows to HAP accessory setup,controlling Matter accessories in Control Centerwith just one swipe down,and the great hands-free integrationwith Siri for Matter accessory statusand then control across all your Apple devices.But HomeKit's responsibilityisn't just to support first-party features.In fact, since day 1, we designed HomeKit with the visionthat app developers should be able to leverage HomeKitto build creative and then delightful smart home appsfor their customers, without the burdento implement communication protocols with accessories.This continues to be true with Matter accessories.Keep using existing APIs as you've been using in HomeKit.They will all just start working with Matter accessories,no code change needed.Let's take accessory setup as an example.This code shows how you could callthe addAndSetupAccessories API in your HomeKit app today.With iOS 15 developer preview, the QR code scanner you invokeby this API will not only work for HAP QR codes,but also start recognizing Matter QR codes,providing your customers a familiarand a consistent experience for accessory setup.For a bit of fun, those of you who have been payingclose attention to this year's Swift updates know that there'sa shift underway in the world of Swift concurrency.We are glad to let you know that the same APIsyou are used to can now be invoked via the newSwift async/await paradigm, as well.Besides setup, with iOS 15 developer preview,you will also be able to use existing HomeKit APIsto read and write Matter accessory states.Moreover, you will automatically get remote accessand timely notifications for Matter accessories,and then be able to add and edit Matter accessoriesusing scene and automation APIs,all in the same way as what you do with HAP accessories.Let's also take a sneak peak into the future.As Matter project continues to develop, we expect itto provide support for more and more accessory categories.We will continue integratingthese new Matter accessory categories into HomeKit,making it effortless for our developers to use them.Secondly, HAP, as a protocol, supports custom characteristics.It allows manufacturers to build creative custom featureswith their accessories and access them through HomeKit.Matter, as a protocol, supports custom features, too.So, we'd like to connect the dots here and thenprovide you access to Matter custom featuresvia HomeKit framework.This feature will be coming in the later release,so stay tuned, and let us know if you have early thoughts.In short, we are committedto seamlessly integrating Matter with HomeKit.Whether you are an accessory developer,a HomeKit app developer, or a HomeKit customer,rest easy, as Matter "Just Works."When you use HomeKit to integratewith Matter accessories,you get features like secured remote controland automations for free,thanks to the power and intelligenceof Apple smart home hubs, such as HomePod and Apple TV.But if you also have a need to help your customersto connect Matter accessories with other smart home hubsin your homes, we are making it easy for youto do so from your iOS app, as well.Next, I'm going to pass to Chris to tell you more about it.Thank you, Selina.For this year's developer preview,we are building a new, yet conceptually familiar setup APIthat enables you to establish a direct connectionbetween a Matter accessory and your home hubs.Let's start by exploring the user experience.As you can see here, this flow strongly resembleshow we set up both Apple productsand HomeKit accessories today.We know our customers are familiar with this flow,we know they love it, and we want youto benefit from it, too.It is important to note here that while this is system UI,the homes and rooms the user selects fromare vended from your app.Your app is responsible for completing required operationsand providing requested informationto set up via a new app extension type.Let's unpack this for you step by step.Before beginning setup, your app creates a topology objectrepresenting the homes it manages.It then passes this topology object to a new setup API.At this point, setup is launched and readyto scan a Matter QR code.Here's a code example for invocation.As you can see, this API is conceptually very similarto the existing HomeKit APIs for accessory setup.The major difference is the additionof the HMCHIPServiceTopology object,which is used to inform setup of the homes your app manages.When the user scans a Matter QR code with the scanner,setup will automatically progress to a Detected cardthat shows the category of accessory detected.The user is now presented with the option of addingthe accessory to your app,in this example, Autohome.Once the user has elected to connect the accessoryto your home hub, they may need to specifywhich specific home to add to.We present this screen in the event you initiated setupwith a topology consisting of more than one home.If your topology consisted of only a single home,this card is skipped, as the user's intent is already known.Once the user selects a home,iOS sends a request to your extension asking itto pair with the scanned accessory's Matter payload.Your extension responds to this request via it's principleHMCHIPServiceRequestHandler subclass.When called, use CHIP framework APIs to createa secure pairing between the Matter accessoryand your home hub.Next, iOS will request a list of roomsfrom your extension that correspondsto the selected home.These rooms are presented in UI for user selection.The code to respond to this request in your extensionis straightforward.Just like the pair request, it revolvesaround your extension's principleHMCHIPServiceRequestHandler subclass.Simply implement this function and returnthe corresponding rooms that match the user's selected home.Once the user has selected a name and roomfor their accessory, we provide that informationto your extension and ask it to configure the accessory.Just like the other request types, your extensionwill respond to the configuration requestby using CHIP framework APIsto directly configure the accessory.Finally, after the accessory is fully configured for your app,the user will also be offered with the opportunityto use the Apple Home app,Control Center, and Siri to control this accessory.Collected in its entirety here again is the codewe expect your extension to implement.Three simple functions:room request, pair accessory request,and accessory configuration request.Once you have subclassed HMCHIPServiceRequestHandlerand overridden these methods, the rest of the setup experienceis essentially free from a developer perspective.Things like UI presentation,transitions between steps, error handling, etc.,are all handled for you.This greatly reduces the amount of codeyou need to write, while simultaneouslyproviding your users a truly first-class experience.So far, we have talked about how you can use existingHomeKit APIs to integrate with Matter accessories,as well as a new API if you need to connectMatter accessories with another smart home hub.If you're a Matter accessory developer,you will also need to get familiar with the protocolitself for the purposes of firmware development.So next, my colleague, Sagar, will take uson a tour of the Matter protocol and show youthe similarities between Matter and HAP.Thanks, Chris.Let's start with the Matter data model.Every Matter accessory exposes its capabilitiesvia the Matter data model.We can individually address these capabilitiesstarting from the top with endpoints.Endpoints can be thought of as logically separatefeatures of an accessory.Most accessories will only have a couple of these:one for information, like name, vendor,and model; and the other for the primary functionof the accessory, for example, a light.Each endpoint can have multiple clusters within it.Each cluster represents a specific capabilityof that endpoint.For our light example, its light endpointmight have clusters for brightness,color, and power control.For those of us familiar with HomeKit,clusters can be thought of as equivalent to HomeKit services.Next up, we look at what a cluster has within it.A cluster can have one or more attributes.Each attribute represents some state of the accessory.For our light example, the brightness clusteron the light will have an attribute that lets usread and control the brightness of the light.Again, Matter's attributes can be thought ofas equivalent to HomeKit characteristics.Finally, here you can see that each attribute may support a setof actions ranging from reading, writing, and reporting.In our light example, we might want reporting enabledon the on-off cluster to receive notifications fromthe accessory every time the light turns on or off.Matter usually offers a broad selection of APIs to configureand interact with each attribute based on its function.These concepts we just talked about are beingimplemented in the open source CHIP framework,with Apple being one of the key contributors.As Selina mentioned earlier,CHIP has been renamed to Matter,but the framework and the code will be updatedin a future release.A fully-certified version of CHIP frameworkwill be distributed in iOS,which enables HomeKit integrationwith Matter accessories,and also provides access to open source APIsif you need to use them in your app.Let's take a look at an example of usingCHIP framework to interact with a light accessory.This exercises the core conceptsof the Matter data model we just went over.We start off by accessing the shared CHIPController.This controller is our primary handle to Matter.Next, we get a handle to the light by usingthe device ID that we assigned to it during pairing.Then, we initialize a handle to the on-off clusteron the light endpoint.And now, with this on-off cluster,we can perform reads and writes on the on-off attribute.First, we request to toggle the on-off attribute,which just toggles the state of the light.Then, we request to read the state of the on-off attribute.The accessory then sends us a response with the statusof the attribute, which we can use to update our application.So, that's a quick look into CHIP framework.Before we conclude our session today,we'd like to go over a new concept introduced in Matterand show some new features we've introducedin the Home app that leverage it.As you may already know, the Matter protocolallows multiple admins to connectto an accessory at the same time.This is a great feature for providing customers choices,but it also poses challenges to uswhen it comes to accessory management.Let's take a look at how the Home app incorporates this.The Home app can now present a list of allthe connected admins on an accessory under thisnew Connected Services section.Users are also given the option to manage connected admins.And finally, users have the optionto turn on pairing mode again to allowa new admin to connect with the accessory.Our goal here is simple: we want to ensure thatour customers have the freedom to choosewhat's best for them,and also the confidence to tellhow their smart home accessories are being managed.So, Matter support will first be available in the iOS, iPadOS,and tvOS 15 developer preview,and a developer profile must be installedon these platforms to enable it.You will also need a home hub to controlMatter accessories via HomeKit.While we expect Matter to publish qualifiedvendor IDs and certified product IDs once they becomeavailable for the market, we will provide a listof sample vendor IDs and product IDswith the developer preview to facilitate your development.These IDs are pre-configuredto represent Matter accessory categoriesthat are already supported in the developer preview.As always, you can find more informationabout our APIs on developer.apple.com.And more information about the Matter open source APIsand Matter accessory definitions can be found on Github.So, in conclusion, we are bringing seamlessMatter support via HomeKit for accessory developers,HomeKit apps, and HomeKit users.There will be a new setup API in an upcoming seedfor developers who need to connect Matter accessorieswith other smart home hubs.And all of this will be availablestarting with the iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS 15 developer preview.Thank you for watching, and from my team and I, goodbye.[percussive music]
