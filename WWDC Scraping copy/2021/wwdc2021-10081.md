with a quick recap of both the how and the whyfor anybody new to game input on Apple platforms.Next, I’m going to show you a new type of virtual game controller,and we’ll write a little code together.Finally, I want to talk about more actual physical controllersand work through some of our new features.So let’s start out with our review.The game controller framework’s goal is making it easy to add supportfor all different kinds of efficient, low-latency inputacross Apple platforms.By abstracting input hardware through the common API,the game controller framework lets you write your input code oncewithout having to worry about how input may have been remappedor the differences among specific controllers,keyboards, or pointing devices.On iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS,players can create system-wideand per-application game controller input remappings,which help make your games more customizable and more accessible.And on all platforms, you can build your UI to reflect the symbolsand capabilities of the specific controllers the player is holding.So whether your player is on team circle-square-triangle-crossor on team A-B-X-Y,your game UI will look right for them.The basics of the game controller framework is reacting to notificationsabout different kinds of GCDevice objects connecting and disconnectingand either polling active devices for input stateor setting up value-changed handlersto be notified about input state changes.When controllers connect or disconnect from the system,GCController objects are created and removed,and you are sent GCControllerDidConnectand GCControllerDidDisconnect notifications.It’s the same pattern with GCKeyboard objectswhen keyboards connect or disconnect, and with GCMouse objectswhen pointing devices connect or disconnect.All you need to do is add an observer to find out when,for example, a GCController objects connects or disconnects.Then it’s up to you whether to set up those change handlersto notify you when input state changes,or to poll the state of the controller elsewhere.This is the same pattern you should usewhether it’s a controller, a keyboard, or a pointing device.We’ve seen so many great new games supporting game controllersand huge customer interest in games that support controllers well.That’s why we really want to help people find gamesthat support game controllers.When we know a game supports game controllers,we badge it in the App Store with the Controller Supported badge.That looks like a little thing, right?But it’s something players are looking for if they love using their controllers,and I know it’s a badge I look for.And we’re always on the lookout to curate and promote appsthat work great with game controllers.There are multiple sections for games when we discover appsthat make game controllers really shine.I can’t guarantee that your app will be chosen for promotion,but when you do a great job with controllers,players will definitely notice.So here’s all you have to do to mark your app’s support.In Xcode, just add the Game Controllers capability.This tags your application’s Info.plistwith the game controller capability,and that’s all you need to dobefore submitting it to the App Store.When your game has this capability,we also know to include it in the per-app customization sectionof the Game Controller preferences panel.Players love the ability to tweak controls to their liking,and it’s a great way to improve your game’s accessibility.You don’t have to do anything to participate in input remapping,but when you tag your game,players can customize it specifically.Another terrific feature you get for freewhen you adopt the game controller framework is screenshots and video clips.Players can capture a screenshot or start and stop video clip recordingswith a quick touch of the controller’s share button.Here I am playing Fox2.I can capture a screenshot by double-tapping on the Share button.The screenshot lands right in my Camera Roll,to my Desktop if I’m on macOS,or it AirDrops to my phone from AppleTV.Now here’s what happens if I want to start and stop a screen recordingusing a long press of the Share button.A little bit later, I’ve got some newsabout a new type of game clip recording we’ve added this year.My last bit of advice about what gives a game polished controller supportis the proper use of glyphs in your UI.Consider this hint to use a buttonto display your inventory.On an MFi or Xbox controller,we should show the Y button.On a PlayStation controller,we instead want to show a triangle.It may seem like a small thing, but wow, we really hear feedbackabout the wrong button names showing in your UI.You might consider another approach shown hereof optionally representing positional button locationsif it’s more appropriate for your game.Some players, especially new and young players,may more quickly recognize the location you’re showing themand they don’t have to glance down to try to read the button names.We made it super easy to always show the right glyph,even if the player has remapped a button in the system remapping UI.So for example, if we have mappedthe press of the X button to the A action,as shown here in the remapping preferences,and we want to ask the user to press the A action to continue,we actually want to show the X glyphwhen a developer asks for the glyph associated with the A action.To do this, we just querythe sfSymbolsName of the A button,then use UIImage system image named to get an image to display.Now we’ll show the correct glyph based on the remapping.So that was my very quick recap.If you find you need more details, check out these other talksabout game controllers from past WWDC conferences.So over the past few years, we’ve talked with a lot of developersbringing games to iOS and iPadOS.Many are games designed originally around game controller input,so they’re expecting two analog sticks,maybe a d-pad or touchpads, and digital button input.What we heard was that some of you had a hard time buildingconsistent, great-feelingand great-looking touch-based input for these games.We heard that your touch input handling code was differentfrom your keyboard, mouse, and game controller input code paths.To address this, I want to tell youabout our new virtual on-screen controllerwhich is compatible with all your existing game controller input code.These new on-screen controls for iPhone and iPad look amazing,and they’re carefully tuned for grip locations across hand sizesand for a great responsiveness and feel.They’re easy to add to your applicationand act just like a game controller.Instead of writing your own on-screen overlay UIand translating touch inputs into your game input system,these on-screen controls appear to your codejust like game controller framework GCController objects,so your input logic can remain much more consistent.They’re customizable with your own symbols,and they integrate with your colors and stylewhile still sharing elements of the design languageof iOS and iPadOS.They adjust to a variety of layouts depending on whether you wantjust one button, three buttons,or a d-pad and multiple buttons.The core principle of the on-screen controlleris that the left and the right regions are independently configuredand that the layout is determined based on the configuration.Manual placement of elements is not supported.Per side, a configuration can be built with zero to four buttonsand one of either a thumbstick,a d-pad, or a touchpad.There are haptics on the buttons and the sticks.And finally, configurations are fixed at the time of creation.You can show and hide elements, but you can’t add or remove themwithout creating a new virtual controller.So let’s take a look at what you do to choose a layoutand show your on-screen virtual game controller.First, you create a GCControllerConfigurationidentifying all the possible buttonsand joysticks you will want to use.Then, you create a virtual controller from that configuration.Then, you can optionally do some configuration on the elements,such as setting custom shapesor having some elements hidden.Next, you tell the system to connect the controller,and that will trigger the same GCGameControllerDidConnectnotification that you’re used to handling,and that gives you a GCController object.So let’s take a look at the code we would writeto get a layout like what I’m showing here:a thumbstick on the left, a thumbstick on the right,and an A and B button on the right.It’s super easy.We start by creating a newGCVirtualControllerConfiguration object.Then we establish which elements we want.We want two thumbsticks and two buttonson the right-hand side, just like in our previous picture.Next we’ll create the GCVirtualController objectusing that configuration.And finally we’ll call connect; our standardGCControllerDidConnectNotification is going to arrive.So that was easy.But how do we establish our own visuals for these buttons,like what I have in this picture?This is readily done by adjustingthe GCVirtualController element configuration.To create this layout where I’ve changedthe A button to indicate the spinning attackand to set the B button to indicate the jump,I just adjust the A button’s configuration to add a BezierPath.Then I set the B button to establish its BezierPath.It’s just as simple to show and hide different button elementsusing the config.hidden property.So you see, it doesn’t take much to customize these controlsto just your liking.Okay, so let’s get backto the non-virtual world of physical controllers.There are so many great controllers for players to choose from.There are lots of Made for iPhone, MFi controllers,and we see new ones and improvements all the time.The standalone SteelSeries Nimbus+,now with L3/R3 thumbstick triggersand more system buttons is really terrific.I’m also a huge fan of the form-fitting Razer Kishi and the Backbone One.These types of form-fitting controllersare my new favorites to keep in my backpack.Of course, besides MFi controllers,we support the Sony DualShock 4 and Xbox One controllerson all Apple platforms, and players love the Xbox Elite V2and the Xbox Adaptive controller support we added last year.We just added support in iOS 14.5and macOS 11.3 for the latest generationof console controllers.The Sony DualSense controller and the Xbox Series X controllersare such great-feeling controllers,and they just work when you’re using the game controller framework.The Xbox Series X controller has a new dedicated Share button,and the DualSense has cool adaptive trigger technology.Let’s take a moment to dig into the adaptive triggersand how you can to put them to use.The DualSense adaptive triggers really allow you to improve game immersionthrough the use of force feedback.By dynamically applying a varying resistance to the trigger basedon what the player is doing, you can emulate the feelingof pulling a bow string or a slingshot that’s under tensionand many more sensations.I hope you get a chance to feel how great these triggers feel.The way to support adaptive triggersin the game controller framework is really straightforward.First, you need to verify that the physical input profileon the player’s controller is a DualSense.Next, you simply set the adaptive trigger effect you’re afterwith a method call.If you want to create a really dynamic effect,you can continuously read the state of the adaptive triggers and the gameand adjust your effect accordingly.For example, you can apply more resistanceas the trigger is pulled harderor as the player pulls a rope into greater tension.Finally, just like I remind my kids to turn out the lightswhen they leave a room, you need to make sure you turn offthe adaptive trigger effect when you’re done.Let’s jump in to a quick code exampleto see how to achieve this in practice.So let’s say we have a gamewhere a player can fire a slingshotto knock out some targets.The player can start aiming with the left triggerand pull back on the slingshot with the right trigger.We want to add an adaptive trigger effectas the player pulls back on the slingshot.First, we’ll want to make sure that the player’s controller is a DualSense.Since our game is a single-player game,we can just check GCController.currentto get the active controller.After that, we can grab the DualSense’s right adaptive trigger.In this example, we’ll only want to apply a resistive forcewhen the player is aiming their slingshot.We’ll dynamically calculate the strength of our applied resistancebased on how far the trigger has been pulled.If the trigger has not been pulled all the way back,we’ll apply a feedback effect to the adaptive triggers.The feedback effect provides a constant resistance to your fingeras you pull the trigger.Now, otherwise, if the trigger has been pulled all the way back,we’ll apply a vibration effect with a low frequency.This effect causes the triggers to vibrate,emulating the feeling of struggling to keep that slingshotpulled back and in tension.Finally, once the player fires their slingshot,we want to turn the adaptive trigger off.Our final topic of conversation todayis about media capture through game controller Share buttons.Last year, we introduced some media capture gestureson a controller’s designated Share button.The Share button is usually mappedto the upper left-most system button on a controller,but some controllers like the Xbox Series Xhave a button labeled Share elsewhere.As I showed you earlier, the system gestures for media captureare a double press to capture a screenshot to your Camera Roll,and a long press to start and stop a ReplayKit recording.This year, we’re adding a super cool new type of media capture,15-second highlights.So now instead of having to remember to start and stop your recording,players can just turn on automatic background buffering,which will let them save the last 15 seconds of gameplayany time they long press.ReplayKit clips are an awesome wayto let gamers capture a great boss battle,an amazing combo move, or an epic fail.To choose between our automatic form of starting and stoppinga longer recording or starting the background recordingwhich you can then save 15-second highlights from,just toggle the global or per-application settingin the Game Controller preferences panel.If you want to trigger your own highlights for important points in your game,there’s an API for that.That will trigger those 15-second snapshots as well.Whew. Okay.So that wraps up our game input news for this year.Before you go, please remember to tag your app with game controller supportto get per-app customizationand so the App Store can categorize your app properly.We really look forward to seeing how you make use of game controller,keyboard, and mouse input in your games.If you’re ready to watch more presentationsabout features for game developers and for gamers,check out “Discover rolling clips with ReplayKit”and “What’s new in Game Center” as well.Thanks so much for watching.We hope to see you in person again soon.For now, we’re looking forward to meeting you onlineand helping answer your questions.[upbeat music]
