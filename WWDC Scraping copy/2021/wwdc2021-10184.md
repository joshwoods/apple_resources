Search this video…Welcome to “Design for Group Activities.”I’m Ian Baird, manager of the FaceTime team at Apple.In this session, we are going to talk aboutdesigning a great experience using Group Activities,but before we get started, let’s recap what Group Activities areand how it relates to SharePlay.Group Activities is the frameworkwhich plugs your app into SharePlay.It also provides the capability for messagingand synchronizing media playback.But before we get started,I’d like to share the promise of Group Activities with you.Imagine you had access to a framework backedby a world-class low-latency networking infrastructure,allowing you to privately and securely reach anyonein the world using an Apple device.That’s the powerful system behind FaceTime,which is now open to you with Group Activities.With the power of Group Activities,you can watch a movie with a distant relative,shoot the perfect three-pointer,share photos of your amazing vacationwith friends and family, or learn a new language,like Swift using Swift Playgrounds and screen sharing.My friend just found a new house in Nashvilleand wants me to take a look.Using the power of screen sharing,I’m transported directly to the experience,and I can tell her exactly what I think of the houseshe's interested in while we’re on a FaceTime call.The key here is that these activitiesare all things people love to do together.Before SharePlay, you’ve probably designedand built your app around a single person.All these examples are things people love to do together.You should look for activities in your appto bring people together, encourage conversation,collaboration, or just enjoyment.As we noted, first you’ll want to discover the activitiesin your app best suited to sharing on a FaceTime call.Once you identify these experiences,next you want to enhance them for sharing,add context to make the experience meaningfulto the participants in the call, and automate the experienceby adopting Group Activities API.This will make it easy for peopleto get into your experiences.Let’s talk about how to enhance your app for sharing.There are three tools in Group Activity you can useto bring people together.First is screen sharing, second is shared media playback,and finally, we’ll talk about some custom UI techniqueswhich can make your experience fit well in Group Activities.While on a FaceTime call, people can share their screen,and they can share your app automatically.This is a great way for people to discover what to do together.When your app UI is shared, it’s important to considerwhich parts of your app are relevant for sharing.By default, everything is shared except for secure entry fields.You can use UIKit API to further restrict the visibilityof this information on iOS during screen sharing sessions.Your audio is also shared automaticallywith those on the call, but protected content like musicand movies will not be shared over screen sharing.This is where you need to implement Group Activitiesto support coordinated media playback.This starts media on everyone’s device at the same timeand keeps them in sync with rate changes and seeks.To be clear, this does not stream media from deviceto device but synchronizes playback on multiple devices.You get smart volume control and the synchronizationfor free, but it is up to you to decide what to dowith seeking, rate changing, playback controls, et cetera.For more information, check out the related session below.IOS 15 supports seamless upgradesfrom screen sharing to media playback.Beginning SharePlay automatically upgradesthe experience to rich media content.What if your app doesn’t fall into a media bucket?No, problem.The Messenger protocol allows you to broadcast datato all the other apps on the call in near real time.It’s private and end-to-end encryptedjust like the FaceTime call.This makes it great for driving apps with Custom UI.Custom UI is a great way to get people together in your app.You can us this to draw custom views,like the one that Adam has drawn “Hello World” into.For more information on this,check out the related session below.Now that you have evaluated your app, its activities,and thought about ways it can be enhanced for sharing,you might come up with new ideas on activitieswhich didn’t make sense with a single person in mind.We are especially excited about the opportunities herewhere Group Activities inspires a whole new kind of appthat brings people together.Here are some examples of how SharePlay is used by Apple.The TV app can be used with screen sharing for peopleto discover their next favorite TV show to binge watch together.The Music app has been enhanced to share your favorite new songsand artists with your friends on a FaceTime call.Now that we have defined our activities and lookedat some of the cool new shared experiences Apple has defined,we can come up with great experiencesto bring people together.The next concept I want to talk about is howto make Group Activities contextual.Relating your app and its contentto the conversation is a super helpful wayto make sure your app is SharePlay ready.When someone first launches your appwhile on a FaceTime call, they’re shownif it supports SharePlay right within the context of your app.And if your app contains video content,then you have an opportunity to communicate to themthat they can share that content with the peoplewho are on the FaceTime call.Once they find the content they want to watch,they will simply tap the SharePlay button,and everyone’s show will start.Once an app or content is shared,activity preview tells everyone elseabout what you’re suggesting they watch.Activity previews are an opportunityto give everyone context about what they are about to watch,so it’s important that you use this as best as possible.Use it like a rich link, with a title, subtitle,and thumbnail to describe the experienceeveryone is enjoying on the FaceTime call.Imagine receiving a message like this with very little context.It’s important to make sure that these titlesand subtitles correspond to the action in the call.As you can see in this example, it’s importantto make these titles and subtitles meaningful.This is a great example of howto make a meaningful activity preview.Remember that whenever someone is interactingwith their phone during SharePlay,they are essentially multitasking,so we need to make sure the interaction is as easyas possible.So automate as much as you canand minimize unneeded upfront interactionbefore getting into the activity.One way you can make SharePlay super easyis to have your app auto launch from the backgroundon everyone’s device automatically.The way you do this is by supporting Picture in Picturewithin your app.For more information on this,check out related sessions below.Sometimes your app might need some interaction,like to sign up or subscribe for more content.If that’s the case, simply call the Group Activities APIand tell us that your app needs foreground presentation.The user will tap the banner,and your app will be brought to the foreground,allowing the user to interact before joining the experience.However, it’s important to use this feature with care.If someone doesn’t have your app installed,when the activity begins or they join the call,they’ll be taken to the App Storeto install it when they tap the notice.As you can see, we’ve made it easy for peopleto get into your app.You should streamline the path into the activity.It’s important to remember that any user interactionis happening on a FaceTime call, so thingslike account sign up, purchases, et cetera,all need to be done while also chatting to your friends.Your friends are going to be waitingfor you to complete this interaction.The last thing your want to do is make all of your friends waitwhile you fill out a lengthy form.So question every interaction and see if it’s really necessaryto get to the content and, if possible,delay or automate those interactions.Group Activities are a great wayfor people to experience your app.We are really excited to see the types of activitiesyou will enhance for SharePlay.And make sure you’re adopting all the APIsto make the experience effortless and seamless.For more information on this,check out the related sessions below.And thanks for watching. Enjoy the rest of WWDC21.[music]
