SF Symbols 2

Search this video…Hello, my name is Thalia,and I’m a designeron the Apple Design Team.Today we will learnwhat's new in SF Symbols.The value of symbolsas one of the elementsof user interface designcannot be overstated.They are the simplest form of communicationbetween the user and a productand serve as little pieces of a puzzlethat aid in usabilityand intuitive navigation.They also make interfaces faster to use,helping us navigate quickly,as most symbols are language-independent.They can help communicate contentor help trigger a specific action,and many times, symbols help solve quite a fewcomplex or abstract concepts.SF Symbols brings this all togetherin a library of iconographydesigned to integrate seamlesslywith all the San Francisco font families,providing a powerful and flexible designs resourcefor creating experiences on all Apple platforms.Today, we are going to have a quick recapof the SF Symbols basics.The repertoire keeps growing,so we will take a look at some of the new symbols additions.We have expanded the localized symbolsby increasing the script coverage.We will look at those in localization.We will study the anatomy of a symboland learn how its structuremakes color possible.We will discover the benefitsof adding colors to symbols in rendering modes.And finally, we got some exciting updatesto the SF Symbols appand the color library,so let’s get started.Each symbol comes in a wide range of weightsthat automatically align with text labels.In iOS, SF Symbols supports Dynamic Typeand the Bold Text accessibility feature.SF Symbols are also available in three scales:small, medium, and large.These scales maintain the same point size,changing only their scales,with stroke thicknesses that are optically adjustedand weight-matched with the text.You also need to be aware of two different alignments.First is the vertical alignment.Symbols are automatically vertically centeredto San Francisco's cap-heightin all the different scales and weights.And as you may know,some symbols have negative margins.These margins are there to aid with horizontal alignments.That is the casefor most variants with badges, for example.When displayed in the UIs,symbols will be horizontally centered,giving a consistent look,especially when displaying similar symbol variants.If you want to learn more about all the features in SF Symbols,last year’s session from WWDC20will get you up to speed.Now let's talk about symbol variants.A symbol is definedas a representation of a symbolic valuethat is used for the purpose of communication.For example, the word "love"is represented by a heart.In UIs, a symbol is part of a visual systemthat conveys meaning.To enrich this communication system,a symbol with the same representationcan come in many different forms.In SF Symbols, the default,or universal variant,is the outlined version of a symbolas it relates to the typographyin the way that we can imaginethe same tool drawing the symbol and the text.In the absence of context,outlined is the default.And when we want to make a symbol more prominent,like when we want it to have more surface areato saturate with color for the purpose of selection,the filled variant is a great choice.In SF Symbols,a symbol may come in many different forms.We have outlined and filled variants.We also have slash variants,which are used to conveythe functions of removingor displaying an item as inactive or unavailable.We have enclosing variantsthat are contained inside a shapelike a circle, square, or rectangle.All these variants help make the UIs richerand give more flexibilitywhen setting up visual hierarchieswith the interface elements and the content.A clear visual systemwill go to great lengths in reducingthe appearance of complexity,even when the actions themselves are complex.Consequently,knowing where to use a symbol variant is essential.A filled symbol in swipe actionsand iOS tab barsgive a consistent appearance and level of emphasis,giving better control in areas that indicate selectionwhen defined with an accent color.A symbol inside a circle with a filled variantprovides better legibility at small sizes.And an outlined, or default variant, of a symbolis great for Toolbars, Navigation Bars, Listsand other places in the UIwhere symbols are presented alongside textor where symbols need to displaya uniform appearance.When designing your own symbols, remember to be consistentand define a system that meets the user's needs.In this way, you will help perceive visual metaphorsthat are directly related to the actionsthat the symbols initiateor the content the symbols represent.As symbols become available on all platforms,the SF Symbols library keeps growing,with nearly 600 new symbols available this year.We have expanded the Apple products and devices.And we have new additions for video game controllers.We have some health-related symbols,with plenty of new symbols to represent communication.And new inset symbolsthat are helpful for designsrelated to interface layoutand window management.We also designed some symbols for watchOS.And we have many new objects to choose from,making SF Symbols a librarywith more than 3,000 symbols to choose from.Now let's talk about localization.At Apple, we seek to make interfacesmore inclusive and tailoredfor international and multicultural audiences.This year, we have expandedthe SF Symbols script coveragewith new symbols for Arabic,Hebrew,and Devanagari,and included designs for Thai,Chinese,Japanese,and Korean.We made it easyby making all these localized symbolsand script variants adapt automaticallybased on the user's device language,including right-to-left writing systems.If you are designingfor left-to-rightand right-to-leftwriting systems,consider the directionalityand overall lookof both localized variantsand be aware that in some cases,some symbols will nothave the intended lookwhen mirrored.In this case,a new design tailoredto the specific script's needswill be needed,like in this example.If you want to learn moreabout designingfor right-to-left writing systems,check out the Human Interface Guidelines.Now let's study the anatomy of a symbol.Every symbol starts with a vector point.From there, we can draw two types of segments:straight lines and curves,also known as Bézier control points.We define the design source of a symbolby drawing a pathas a completely enclosed shape.Then we get to expand the stylistic rangeby drawing additional sourcesand making sure that the design sourcesare point compatible;that is, each source has the same numberof vector points.Next, we interpolate the design sources,creating instances that give usthe different weights and scales.So as you can see,drawing with closed paths is really importantin order to achieve consistent shapes,which allow us to have a lot of flexibilitywhen creating a symbol.If you want to learn moreabout interpolation and drawing symbols,check out this year's session "Create Custom Symbols."If you have ever drawn paths with a pen tool,you might be familiar with strokes.Usually, that is the way to give thickness to a path,but for SF Symbols, we do it a bit differently.If you look at it closely,a stroke is a given thickness valueassigned to precisely follow a path.Although a stroke can have any thickness,it typically uses the path as its center.That means that the actual vector pointsthat will define the thickness of the strokeare not reliable for interpolation,as the strokes have no vector pointson their borders.To ensure that the drawings are reliable,to facilitate interpolationand better control the shapes,the strokes must be converted to outlines,which can be achievedwith most vector graphic editorsand design tools.Now that we know how SF Symbols are drawn,let's look at their structure and shapes.As you may have noticed,some symbols combine two or more objects,like the share symbol,which is a combinationof an arrow and a square.When those objects are combined,we can emphasize one shape while de-emphasizing the other.That way, we can define design strategieswith badges and overlaps.We can determine the foreground and background elementsin just one symboland even create different variantswith its different container shapes.There is a lot of versatility.We can even highlight screens.And this is all done with what we call annotations.We group the enclosed vectors of a pathlike layers inside a symbol.That way, we can quickly identifya primary, secondary,and even tertiary layerof a symbol structure,creating a hierarchy.So imagine all the possibilities.Symbols are getting ready to be displayedin all their glory,but not before we talk about rendering modes.Colors can speak in waysthat are as powerful as language,plus it is more than just an aesthetic element,as it can affect thinking,help change actions, and create reactions.As a form of communication,color is compelling.And as you can see,SF Symbols become highly versatilewhen color is applied to themmaking them an even more powerful tool.When color is present,the symbols become one of the most essentialmethods of engaging the user,helping you create a statement or draw attention.This year, we are happy to announcethat we have new rendering modes to choose from:Hierarchical and Palette,in addition to Multicolor and Monochrome.First let's look at Hierarchical.Hierarchical rendering modeuses a single color with varying opacitiesthat add visual hierarchy to a symbol,creating depth and emphasiswhile allowing a single hue to drive the overall aesthetic.When multiple symbols that share common shapesare presented alongside one another,this rendering modeemphasizes the differences between them,intending to make the symbols more legible and recognizable.It also attempts to reduce redundant visual noiseby modulating the opacitywithout removing the essential elementsof the symbol.We achieve this by annotating the symbolswith the desired hierarchy,considering the primary, secondary,and in some cases,the tertiary element of a symbol.When a base color is applied to a symbol,it is automatically appliedto all the layers in the hierarchy,using different opacitiesto emphasize the key characteristicsof the symbol.Let's analyze these symbols again,now with the Hierarchical rendering mode.Some symbols have all the hierarchy levels.This symbol with a cloud, sun, and rainis a good example,but one important thing to knowis that most symbolsdon't have all these three levels.This is due to the nature of their designs.Let's focus on these symbols.Shapes that don't touchor have a gap between the firstand second element of a symbolare considered secondary,while shapes that do touchand are encapsulated inside one another,like the filled circle or the screensshown in these examples,become tertiary.With Hierarchical rendering mode,we can achieve more robust interfaceswith just the emphasis on hierarchy and color.We saw what we could do with Hierarchical.Now with Palette, we have even more possibilities.As we learned, the Hierarchical rendering modeuses a single color.In contrast, Palette rendering modegives the possibility to use two or more contrasting colors,each of which can be controlled independently,giving elements of a symbolmore prominence, emphasis, and versatilitywhen color is applied to them.Additionally, Palette rendering modehas opacity controlsthat give us even more possibilities,allowing for symbols to be customizedto better integrate with the UI's overall look.This rendering moderelies on the same layer annotation dataas Hierarchical.If only two colors are applied to it,the tertiary layer group replicatesthe secondary layer annotation,so remember thiswhen annotating your own symbols.In Palette rendering mode,a set of symbols can havethe same defined color palette applied to them,helping the user identify a group of symbolswith the same level of functionalities.In contrast,a similar set of symbolscan each use unique colorsto define a particular functionality,reinforcing the actions of the symboland making them more distinctbetween one another.With Palette rendering mode,you can bring contrast and versatility to your symbols.Now let's talk about Multicolor.Multicolor is a rendering mode that representsthe intrinsic or native color of a symbol.That means it uses a multitude of different colorsthat relate to the appearance of an objectin the physical world,or it conveys meaning between a conceptand an assigned color,like in this example.The concept Add is linked to the color Green,and the concept Remove is linked to the color Red.Many symbols feature this intrinsic color palettewhich is what's rendered by default.When customized,each color can be assigned an arbitrary one.With Multicolor symbols,you can emphasize the symbol's identity,creating a stronger color narrativethat associates with the symbols' forms.There are a few ways in which Multicolorcan affect a symbol.A symbol can be fully colored.A symbol can be partially colored,which means that part of a symbolwill have the Multicolor feature,while the other will rely on an accent color.And finally,if a symbol does not contain any Multicolor information,it will render in Monochrome.This year, we are introducing several new symbolswith Multicolor functionality.The range of colors from which this drawsis limitless.And lastly, we have Monochrome.Monochrome is the rendering modethat most closely reflectsthe typographic nature of SF Symbols.Color-wise, it is neutralas it accommodates for symbolsto commingle with one anotherwithout emphasizing one over the other.Monochrome also benefits from color and opacity controls,but the difference with other rendering modesis that in Monochrome,the opacity is applied to all the symbolwithout making use of the layer annotation data.When uniformity is of first importance,Monochrome is ideal,as it is the most unified and consistent rendering mode.Next let's talk about the SF Symbols app.This year, we have made significant changesto the SF Symbols app.As we have seen,we have all the new and improved rendering modes:Monochrome,Hierarchical,Palette,and Multicolor.To access all these colors for the rendering modes,we have the color picker.Here you can choose from the existing color library,select the system accent color,or even define your own custom colors,and indeed, all colors shownin the SF Symbols appare all available on all platforms.We also have some updates to the color libraryin light,dark,and increased contrast appearanceswith some colors adaptingdepending on the platform.As a result,some platforms will get new colorsthat were previously only availableon other platforms.For example, Brown--previously only available on macOS--is now available on all platforms.We also re-defined Teal with a greener hueto reflect its visual representationmore accurately.Cyan is a new color namethat will use the previous Teal color values.If you were previously using Teal,you will need to switch to the color Cyanto maintain the legacy appearance.Additionally, Indigo and Purpleare available on all platformswith more consistent hue definitions.From rendering mode selection to color customization,SF Symbols is an extremely powerful toolto use when implementing symbols in your UIs.If you want to learn more about the SF Symbols App,check out this year's session "Explore the SF Symbols 3 App."So, let's recap what we'e covered.We have a new version of the appthat is now available for download.We have hundreds of new symbols.You can find the new beta versionof the SF Symbols app in developer.apple.com/sf-symbols.We talked about variants,and we had a quick recap of the SF Symbols basics.We have new script coverage for localized symbolsand new symbols adapting to right-to-left writing systems.We learned about the anatomy of a symboland how drawing with vector points and pathscan make layer annotation possible.We talked about colorwith some awesome new rendering modes:Hierarchical and Palette.And we reviewed more in-depththe Multicolor and Monochrome modeswith all their amazing features.Remember that all rendering modesadapt dynamicallywith Apple platform system colors.These automatically adjust the vibrancy,accessibility settings,and appearance modes.These rendering modes work with custom colors as well.And we saw the new SF Symbols appand learned about all the color library updates.This year,SF Symbols becomes more powerful,flexible, and configurable,tailored to suit your needs.One symbol in nine weightswith three scales eachin four rendering modes.That is amazing.I hope you enjoyed learning aboutwhat's new in SF Symbols.We can't wait to see what you will do.[music]
