What’s new in managing Apple devices

Search this video…♪ ♪Hello and welcome to WWDC.I'm Austin, and I workon the Apps and Books Management API.I'll be sharing with you improvements we have broughtto a new API version,enabling your MDM solution to manage Apps and Booksin a faster and more scalable way than ever before.You're likely already usingthe Apps and Books Management APIto enable organizations using your productto manage their owned apps and books.The organization may have acquired these assetsthrough either Apple School Manageror Apple Business Manager.And the API allows for you to assignthese owned apps and booksto the organization's managed users and devices.We've introduced a lot of changes this yearto the new Apps and Books API.We'll cover many of these throughout this sessionbut focus on the two enhancementsthat will most improve your workflows:Real-time notificationsand Asynchronous processing.For an in-depth look at the other changes,see the new developer documentationwithin the Device Management section on developer.apple.comand in the references for this session.Let's get started with Real-time notifications.We now support Real-time notifications for state changesto assignments, assets, and registered users.You need to opt-in to these notifications,and you will only receive notificationsfor the types you subscribe to in client config.Real-time notifications finally remove the needfor you to continually sync state.Let's discuss the notification types a little more in-depth.The first notification type is for assignments.An assignment is when an asset is allocatedto either a user or device managed by an organization.If you have to wait for confirmationthat entire groups of assignmentshave been performed successfully,that will lead to delaysin installing the content that users need.Now, with assignment notifications,you'll know in real-time exactly what assignmentshave successfully been performed and to which devices.You subscribe to the asset managementnotification type in client config to receive these.Apple will then proceed to notify youwhen assignment states are altered by either an associate,disassociate, or revoke assets event.You may now rely on these notificationsto provide users and devicesfaster access to content as they are assigned.Let's look at an example of this notification.When an assignment occurs, you get this notification.The example here was triggered by an associate assets call.Apple posts these notificationswith a shared secret in the authorization headerprovided by you in client config.The notification contains a payload,which is specific to a given notification type.The type is denoted here, which for this notificationis asset management.In our notification payload,we can see the assignmentswhose state has attempted to be altered,event ID, the unique identifierfor this MDM-triggered asynchronous event.We'll get into more detail regardingthe asynchronous nature of our new API in a bit.Here is the result of the state change,whether it succeeded or failed.And the type of change to assignment state,which here is an associate.The next notification type is for assets.Assets are apps and books that an organization has purchasedin either Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager.That organization is not able to manage and assign the assetsuntil your MDM knows that they own the content.With asset notifications, you're notified in real-timewhen changes to assets occur from purchases,transfers, or refunds,and your MDM can always knowthe current available count of each asset.You subscribe to the asset count notification typein client config to receive these.Apple will then proceed to notify youwhen an asset state changes due to either a buy,transfer, or refund event.These notifications will allow youto quickly provide userswith their recently purchased assets.Let's also take a look at an exampleof this notificationwith the context of what the state of assetslooked like before.To get the current state of assets,we call the "get assets" endpoint.This is the new asset sync endpoint,which you can note by both the proper HTTPrequest method of GET and the versioned URI.Here, we are querying with the query parametersof adamId and pricingParamto receive the state of a single asset.We are now requiring that the server tokenor sToken is provided in the authorization headerof all new API requestsin this bearer token format.We see in the assets array of this responsefor the asset we are interested in,there are 10,000 available for assignmentand 15,000 in total.When a buy happens, you will get this notification.We see in the payload,the adamId for the asset that was purchased.Then the delta, which in this case is a positive integer.This could either denote a buy or a transfer.You'd use this delta to update your countswithout making another call to the asset sync endpoint.The last notification types are for registered users.Most deployments rely on device-based assignments,but when you need to assign content to users,creating registered users is the first step.Associating these users to either personalor managed Apple IDs is then necessary for deployment.For a user's personal Apple ID to be associatedto a registered user for a given sToken,the user must accept an invitationto associate their Apple ID.Now, with registered user notifications,you'll be updated in real-timewith the latest state of users,both for their initial creationand subsequent invitation acceptance.You subscribe to the user managementand user associated notification typesin client config to receive these.Then Apple will notify you when user states are alteredby either create, associate,update, or retire user events.The user associated notificationsspecifically allow you to better trackwhen a user has accepted an invitationto associate their Apple ID.Let's take a look at an example of these notificationswith the context of what the state of userslooked like prior.In order to get the current state of users,we call the get users endpoint.This is the new users sync endpoint.Here, filtering only for the user we are interested inby the clientUserId query parameter.This will limit the response size to only one user.Here, we have some common pagination fields foundacross our sync API,indicating the current page index, size,or in this context, the number of user objectsin the current page,and the total pages in the provided query.In our users array, we can see the only userwe are interested in, in this case,with a status of registered, as opposed to associated,and an invitation code.This user has clearly yetto be associated to an Apple ID.All our sync API also include a version identifier,which will change whenever a write occursto the underlying data.This can be extremely usefulwhen traversing large responsesto indicate when data on prior pages may have changed.You can associate a managed Apple IDto a registered user usingthe new update users endpoint.This results in a registered user notification as seen here.In our notification payload,we see users whose statehas attempted to be altered,unique identifier for this MDM triggered asynchronous event,the result of the state change,whether it succeeded or failed,the type of change to user state, which here is an update.Looking at the users array, we see the clientUserIdfor the user's state we are interested in,containing an idHash and status of associated,concluding that the managed Apple ID associationwas successful.You use this to update your state of this userwithout making another call to the user sync endpoint.Instead of you associating,it is instead possiblethat you provide the user with an invitation linkto associate their own Apple ID to the registered user.Here, we are looking at that associated user notification.We see in the notification payload the user objectcontaining the information regarding the associated userincluding but not limited to their clientUserId,an idHash indicating an associated Apple ID,the invite code they accepted,and status denoting associated.You use this to update your state of this userwithout making another call to the user sync endpoint.Let's talk about how you enroll to receive these notifications.You must opt in via client configfor each sToken you manage.You provide a shared secret for authenticationwith the notificationAuthTokenand the notificationUrl to post these to.The token is used to verify that these notificationsare, in fact, coming from Apple,and this can be updated anytime via client config.Provide an HTTP 200-level responsewhen you receive notifications in order to let Apple knowthat they've been delivered successfully.Apple will attempt to retry the notificationif a non-200 response is returnedor a timeout occurs.Apple will provide a best-effort delivery.This attempt to reach you will be made a few timesbefore discarding the notification.This means if you are unable to receive notificationsfor any period of time,you will need to poll for the latest state.Sync only for what you knowto be in a potentially stale stateas a result of the missed notifications.The second major enhancement brought to this new APIis asynchronous processing.In the initial version of the API,all management was performed synchronously.You make a request to manage some assets,and Apple performs the managementwhile you wait for a synchronous response.This meant you handled parallelism,whereas asynchronous processingenables server-enforced parallelism on Apple's end.This results in processing optimizations,which leads to larger requests being fulfilled more quickly.Ordered processing reduces the amountof intermittent failures and subsequent retries dueto your specific request patterns.And this ultimately leadsto stress-free large deployments,and, for education, easier back-to-school seasons.Apple has already benefited from asynchronous processingfor Apps and Books, purchases, and transfersin both Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager,allowing organizations to see inventory on handin minutes rather than hours.Let's look at how this all comes togetherto make for a great new Apps and Books management experience.Say there's an organization that you managewith 10,000 users, each with their own device.And you're asked to assign 25 appsthat are critical for their daily tasks to each device.You're looking at performing250,000 assignments.Let's look at how you would have done this previously.Your server makes a requestto Apple to manage licenses.Apple returns a response to you synchronously.This response would containthe licenses assigned to requested devices.This single request manages only one appup to a maximum of ten devices,resulting in only ten assignments.This requires a minimum of 25,000 requeststo perform the 250,000 assignments.With the new API,this 25,000 minimum requestsbecomes just 10 requests,all possible by moving to asynchronous processing.Let's look at how you achieve this.On the left, we now have the additionof your notification server.Process still starts with you making a requestto Apple to manage assets.In the request, you provide the sTokenin the authorization header.You can now provide us with multiple assetsin a single request, up to 25 currently.This dynamic limit is exposed in service configand provide up to 1,000 devicesto perform assignment to,another dynamic limitalso exposed in service config.Apple will return a response synchronously to you.In this response, we have the HTTP status code,which is important to this new API.We return appropriate non-200 status codes for errors,so you should initially interrogate the responseto ensure it is a 200 before proceeding.Then, most importantly,we have the unique identifierfor this asynchronous eventwhose status can either be gottenfrom calling our new event status endpointor by waiting for matching assignment notifications.As the assignments complete, assuming you are subscribed,Apple will post notifications to you.In each of these notifications, we have a subsetof the requested assignments listedin our notification payload,the metadata regarding the assignments,indicating whether it was a success or a failure,the type, and the corresponding event ID.You should wait for thesesuccessful assignment notificationsto then proceed with sending install commandsto the devices listed.Another advantageof our new management endpoints is Ordering.Let's say you get a request to reassign some assetsfrom one group of users to another.This can be achieved by you sequentially firing offa disassociate followed by an associate request.First, you post the disassociate request.Apple then responds with the event IDfor the disassociate.Then, you post the subsequent associate request.Apple responds with another event ID,but this time, for the associate.Assuming you are subscribed,Apple will post notifications to youas the disassociations complete.Then, Apple will post notifications to youas the associations complete.Big changes to our API, like notifications,allow you to keep your state in-sync with Apple,removing the need to continually make requeststo ensure you have the latest state.Asynchronous processing allowsfor everyone to have a better experience,whether it be employees or studentsgetting access to the content they need,IT admins performing large deployments rapidly,or you effectively managing an organization's assets.The legacy API will continue to be supported at this time.Note that using the new and legacy API versionsin conjunction for the same tokenwill not be officially supported.This new API is the way forwardfor Apps and Books Management and is available today.We look forward to you testing and integratingwith this new API as soon as possible,providing your users with the best possibleApps and Books Management experience.For more insight, please check outour updated developer documentation.Thank you for your time,and hope you enjoy the rest of WWDC.[ethereal percussion music]
