aerospace engineer,and ever since that moment, I've been stuck on that dream.My name is Tiera Fletcher.I'm a rocket scientist working on NASA's Space Launch System,and I'm working to get us to Mars.I was born and raised in a small townoutside of Atlanta called Mableton, Georgia.Fortunately, I grew up with both of my parentsand two older siblings.My father, he was a construction worker, and he would show mehow to take measurements or how to build small-scale houses.And he didn't realize it,but he was introducing me to engineering.And my mom, when we would goto the grocery store, she would challenge meto calculate the total of the groceries,including tax, minus the coupons,without a calculator.So she did those exercises because she understoodthat I had a passion for mathematics.So at the age of 11, I decided to become an aerospace engineer.I joined a program that taught students about robotics.So being able to design and build was already a passionthat I had acquired prior to the program, but being ableto program that structure that I create and make it move,that just brought it all to life for me, literally.Being able to see something go from paperto product to movement put it all together for me.To continue towards my dream, I decided to attendthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology.While at MIT, I had the opportunityto define antigravity rotations for astronauts.And I also had the opportunity to definethe outer protective layer for the space suit of the future.Since our very first breath,humankind has just had this passion to exploreand discover the unknown, to determine the new frontiers.And really that hungerto produce all of this innovationand technological breakthroughs has caused usto create fantastic innovationsfrom personal computers to global positioning systemsor, as you know it, GPS, and even the Internet.But even before all of those innovations,we've had the passion to go to Mars.Sending 24 humans into space,completing 13 launches, weighing over 6 million poundsand standing taller than the Statue of Libertywas the Saturn V,the largest rocket ever created in history.Some may even argue that the Saturn V was createdto take humanity to Mars.So from 1969 to 1973, the Saturn V servedas the launcher for the Apollo program.So it was literally facilitatinghuman footprints to the Moon.This rocket did not merely justlaunch into the air and breakthrough the atmosphere.It was controlled by groundbreaking avionicsof the time and notablythe Launch Vehicle Digital Computer.With increased computer use on board, it caused an increaseof computer use off board as well.So thankfully, software-enabled processescaused our manual processes to then becomecompletely automated.We are voyagers collectingdata beyond our solar system.Space probes Voyager 1and Voyager 2 have beentraveling through space since the '70s.At more than 14 billion miles away from Earth's surface,these spacecraft are literally in the interstellar medium,breaking barriers of our solar system.Programmed spacecraft are traveling throughout spacecollecting asteroid samples to bring back to Earth.OSIRIS-REx literally collected a sampleof a near-Earth asteroid called Bennuand is bringing it back to Earthso that we can do more research in our labs.Knowledge expands billions of miles away,as we are on a mission to explore new horizons.Known as the fastest human-made objectlaunched from Earth, New Horizons has been ableto tell us more about our former planet, known as Pluto,and also traveling through the Kuiper beltto tell us more about the formationof our solar system.Trips to the International Space Stationare now second nature.Crew-1 just returned from their mission and Crew-2 went offto the International Space Stationback in April. so yeah, one mission down,one mission underway, four more missions to goas part of the commercial Crew program.Our Perseverance has led us to see and hear Marsmore clearly than ever before.The Perseverance Mars Rover has been able to send back datadetailing the visuals and the audio of Marsand also deploy the Ingenuity helicopter so that we canhave that first powered flight on the Martian surface.Humans are now returning to the Moon in preparationto pursue deep space missions, including Mars.And we have a vehicle to propel us there:NASA Space Launch System.I began working on the Space Launch Systemprogram at the age of 22 as a structural designand analysis engineer, and what that means is thatI would design different parts of the rocketand verify the structural integrity of those same parts.And then I wanted to see the rocket, so I decided to goto the Michoud Assembly Facilityin New Orleans, Louisiana, and I workedas an engine section task lead.So those same parts that I just designed, I had to spearheadthe installation of those parts and work with the techniciansto verify that all of the assemblies were correct.Moving on from there, I became a structural engineer,and what that means is that my role was very multifaceted.So I did manufacturing engineering work,structural design engineering work,anything and everything to make surethat the rocket was complete.And then I became fully a structural design engineer,where I had to create drawings and verifyall of the different intricacies of the designs for the vehicle.And now I'm a configuration managementand product integration engineer,or you can say a product life cycle engineer.What that means is that I have to verifythat all of the engineering designs for the parts alignwith the installations of the parts.♪ ♪Being able to not only design componentswith multiple types of software on the computer screenbut also see those components in my faceand touch them, it's--it's mind-blowing.I literally would get to the point of tearsjust thinking about all of the different daysand hours that I worked designing different componentsof the rocket, seeing them in 3D modeling for computer-aideddesign software and then seeing it up front in personactually manufactured and fabricatedand assembled on the rocket.Towering 322 feet tall, the Space Launch System consistsof a few major components.Four RS25 engines.And then you have the core stage,the upper stage, or also known as the interimcryogenic propulsion stage,and then you have solid rocket boosters on either side,and of course you have a crew capsule called Orionthat sits at the top of this massive rocket.The Space Launch Systemis the most powerful rocket ever created in history.Producing over 8 million pounds of thrust,that's actually 15% more thrust than the Saturn V.Most recently, the Space Launch Systemcore stage underwent green run testing.What green run testing means is that the engines areall fired up at the same time as a whole structure,and let's just say that anyone who is nearthe Stennis Space Center can feel the rumbling and the growlof the propulsive system of the Space Launch System.This was a significant test because we had a chance to havemultiple and multiple test cases play a role all within8 to 9 minutes, so it was a very short time framebut super monumentalfor our process to get the Space Launch Systemon the launch stand at the Kennedy Space Center.The interesting part is that we had to move thismassive structure all the way from New Orleans, Louisiana,to the Kennedy Space Center.And that's where the historicalPegasus barge had to come into play.We were able to load the core stageand carefully bring it over to the Kennedy Space Center.Although it can undergomillions of pounds of force, we want to make sure thatthe structural integrity is maintained throughout the wholetransportation process.And now we are stacking up multiple componentsof the rocket in the vertical assembly building so that we canthen shift it over to the launch standso that we can launch at the end of this year.♪ ♪So now let's talk about the missions of how we getback to the Moon and on to Mars.This is through the Artemis program,and it consists of three different missions.The first mission takes place this year in 2021.The Artemis 1 Space Launch System will pairalong with the Orion crew capsule for an uncrewed flight.And the significance of this flight is that it isthe initial flight for the Space Launch System,so it is a mission that will beproving ground for the structurebefore we allow astronauts to come on.And the Orion will travel 40,000 miles away from the Moon,which is about 280,000 miles away from the Earth's surface.In total, Orion will undergo about1.4 million miles of travel from Earth and all the way back.This journey is going to prove very significant becausewe are going to be able to collect data that will fuelthe next Artemis mission, but also it will fuelthe whole future of space travel.Orion is going to undergoan entry at about 24,500 miles per hour.And that's going to cause the capsule to reachabout 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.All of the data that we will collect from this missionwill definitely teach uswhat to do before we allow astronauts on board.In 2022, the Artemis 2Space Launch System in conjunction with the Orionwill carry four astronauts back to the lunar environmentfor the first time in over 50 years.This is extremely significantfor the future of human space travel.The astronauts will undergo a ten-day missionwhere the capsule will make two orbitsaround the Earth and then head over to the Moon.The Orion will begin by reaching an initial insertion orbit.After the first orbit, the interim cryogenic propulsionstage will then propel Orion to high-Earth orbit.The Orion will then be separated from the interimcryogenic propulsion stage so that the astronauts canverify valuable performance and operational capabilitiesso that that data can carry forwardfor the next Artemis mission.In 2024, Artemis 3 Space Launch Systemand Orion will carry astronauts back into the space environment.But this time, the first womanand the first person of color will step foot on the Moon.♪ ♪I knew that I needed a role model to serveas my guiding light throughout my journey,and in that search, I discoveredMae Jemison, the first Black female astronaut.Being able to see someone who looks like meallowed me to see myself becoming an aerospace engineer.Representation is such a vital componentof being able to bring your dreams into reality.I had many moments where I feltthat I couldn't speak up in meetings or that I couldn'tcontribute because of the way that I lookor just because I was the youngest on the teamor the only female on the teamor the only African American on the team.But I had to overcome those barriers and set myselfon the challenge of not only contributingbut giving 150% at all times, because I understoodthat I did not have only the responsibilityof contributing as an engineer but also the responsibilityof widening the pipeline in order to encourage the youth,the upcoming generations,to pursue this field as well, even though there aren't manyof us or a large representation of minorities at this time.So in order to do that, I created an organizationalongside my husband, who’s also a rocket scientist,called Rocket with the Fletchers.So through Rocket with the Fletchers,we do many different outreach opportunitiesfor students to motivate them to follow their dreams.So we teach about aerospace engineering…we mentor… and that's not only the factof talking about how cool aerospace engineering is -it’s about the importance of diversity and inclusionwhen it comes to innovation for humanity.Diversity of mind is at the center,at the forefront, at the root of successful innovationfor the space industry.By actually playing an active role in gettingthe first woman and the first person of color on the Moon,I feel very proud, very proud of the work that I do.But truly in order for us to continue to power innovationwithin the space industry,we have to look at the critical componentsof innovation: passion,data, and diversity of mind.And you know what?Maybe I'll see you on Mars someday.Three, two, one.♪ ♪
