Capture and stream apps on the Mac with ReplayKit

Search this video…Hello, and welcome to"Discover rolling clips with ReplayKit."My name is Ernest,and I'm a software engineer on the ReplayKit team.Today, I'm really excited to show you a new wayto capture your application highlights.Let me start by giving you an overview of ReplayKit.ReplayKit is a framework that enables you to recordyour application's screen and audio.When people want to make an instructional video,or simply just wanna show off their gameplay,in-app screen recording creates a videothat they can save and share with their friends.And what if you wanted more control overthe video content people create?You may want to add additional filters, or overlays.You can do this with in-app screen capture.In-app screen capture will give the audio and video samplesdirectly to your application process,so you'll have complete controlover the content that is being created.And we all know the next best thing to playing a gameis watching gameplay live.In-app broadcast makes it easy for peopleto stream your application to third-party broadcast services,to be viewed all around the world.While our current recording features cover a wide varietyof use cases, there is one that we currently don't.So, imagine your players just fought all the enemiesand unlocked the key to a level in your game,and now they wanna share that moment with their friends.But because it's their first time playing this level,they didn't know something exciting was gonna happen,and they weren't able to capture that moment.Currently, players will need to recordtheir entire gameplay in order to saveall their memorable highlights.This results in a large recording that willnot only take up a lot of space,but will require time to trim into shorter clips.Wouldn't it be awesome if you could recordall the highlights right when they happen?Or even better, what if ReplayKit does this for you,and gives you the video clip of each moment?This year, I'm excited to show youa new feature we've been working on,clips recording.Clips recording will keep a rolling bufferof audio and video samples.When clip export is called, the samples up to 15 seconds priorcan be exported into a short video clip.So now, instead of needing to know when to Start Recording,you just need to know when you want to export.There are several ways to export a video clip.You can add UI buttons or a game controller supportto your application,so people can have manual controlon when to capture clips.With the tap of a button, they canget the clip exactly when they want it.You can also add triggers in your applicationthat will automatically capture clips.With this, you will always capturethose exciting moments when they get a perfect combo,defeat the final boss,or beat their best speed run.And with all of these clips, you can createpersonalized user experiences.You could add a custom overlay that opensto a collection of recordings,or you could present a highlight reelwith all the clips captured at the end of a levelfor your players to see and share.Clips recording will be available for iOS and macOS,and is a powerful feature that will sit alongsideour existing recording, capture, and broadcast APIs.Similar to our other features, clips recording will providethe same HD quality,low-performance impact,and built-in privacy safeguards.How does clips recording work under the hood?Let's take a look.Clips recording includes three APIs: start, stop, and export.To start clip buffering,your application should call into RPScreenRecorderto get the sharedRecorder singleton instance.With the shared instance, you cancall the startClipBuffering API.At which point, ReplayKit will store screenand audio samples from your application in a rolling buffer.Every time ReplayKit receives new samples,any samples older than 15 seconds will be discarded.After the rolling buffer starts, ReplayKitwaits for your application to tell it to export.When the application calls the export clip API,ReplayKit takes care of the rest and returns youthe video clip of that moment.When you no longer need the rolling buffer,or when you want to use another ReplayKit feature,such as in-app broadcast,you can call the stop API,and ReplayKit will tear down the session.With this information in mind,let me show you a sample projectthat implements the new clips APIs.You may already be familiar with this sample projectfrom our session last year.The updated sample project now includes code for clips.Let's take a look at this code.Just like the other recording sessions,here's the IBAction associated with the "start clips" buttonin the main storyboard.This button is used to start clip bufferingif you aren't already active,and stop clip buffering if you are active.Now, let's go ahead and take a look atwhat happens when you start clip buffering.Here is the code to start clip buffering.You're going to get the shared recorder instancefrom RPScreenRecorder and call startClipBufferingwith your completion handler.Here, within the completion handler,you will need to handle any error that occurredwhile attempting to start,including updating the UI.If there's no error, then you should also update the UIto show that the recording is currently active.Similar to start, there's a stop clipbuffering method in the sample project.This is where you're going to get the shared instance,but this time, you'll call the stopClipBuffering API.In the completion handler, you will need to handleany error that occurred while attempting to stop,and should update the UI to show that you're no longer recording.Now that I went through the code for startand stop clip buffering,let's look at the code needed to export a clip.This is the code for the IBActionassociated with the "export clip" button.The action is triggered when a person decidesthey want to generate a clip.Just a reminder that you're not limitedby this approach and may export clips automaticallybased on your own application triggers.Here, if you're actively recording and the buttonis enabled from the previous startClipBuffering method,the exportClip function will be called.To call the exportClip API,you will need to specify a URL and a clip duration.Similar to the start and stop APIs,you will then handle any errors in the completionHandler.If there's no error, then you should havethe clip at the specified URL.With access to the clips, you can then build and organizeyour own user experiences.In my sample code here, the clip is simply saved to Photos.And that's it!With these three APIs, you can now add clips recordingin your application.You will have direct access to the clips in the specified URL,so you can build your own in-app experiences.As previously mentioned, another way to get clipsis by adding game controller support.The game controller framework will now havebuilt-in clips recording.Keep in mind, clips exported from the game controllerwill save directly to Photos or the Desktop.So, to make your own in-app experienceswith the generated clips,you will need to implement the ReplayKit clips API.When integrating both ReplayKitand the game controller framework,it is good idea to make sureyou're using key value observing for both availableand recording properties on RPScreenRecorder.Also be sure to follow the protocolRPScreenRecorderDelegate so that you can updateyour application's state as needed.And it's that simple to integrate clips recordingin your applications.With clips recording, your application will be readyto capture all of the exciting moments when they happen.I look forward to seeing all of the clipsand the new user experiences you will create.Thank you so much for watching our session.I hope you have a wonderful WWDC.[percussive music]
