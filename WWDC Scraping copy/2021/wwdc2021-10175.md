In-App Purchases and Using Server-to-Server Notifications

Search this video…Hello, and welcome to WWDC.My name is Manjeet Chawla, a technical program managerat the App Store, and I'm really excitedto talk about some new features that will help yousupport customers and handle refunds.This is the third session of a three-part seriesfocusing on in-app purchases.And if you haven't already watched "Meet StoreKit 2"or "Manage in-app purchases on your server,"I recommend you take a look after this sessionso you get the full story.In this session, I'll first talk about customer supportand how you can provide contextual supportto your customers.And because refunds are a critical part of support,my colleague, Joe, will talk about handling refundsand a new server API to inform and improve the refund process.Let's start with supporting customers,the benefits and the challenges of providing scalable supportas your business grows on the App Store.Whether your app offers auto-renewing subscriptionsor one-time in-app purchases like consumablesor non-consumables, we are introducing new StoreKitand App Store server APIs for you to help resolvecustomer support issues in a timely and efficient manner.And in addition to providing support,these APIs will help you manage your relationshipswith existing customers after you initially acquire them,increase your overall retention,improve customer satisfaction,which can lead to higher engagement,and reduce churn that grows your long-term revenue.Today, if customers need help for their in-app purchase,they may either contact Apple or you, the developer.And based on the scenario,customers can either use Apple's self-service website,"Report-A-Problem,"or contact Apple Supportvia phone, email, or chat to address the issue.Alternatively, they may also contact youvia social media, forums, or live-chat inside the app.And when they contact you about an in-app purchase,the issue may fall into one of these scenarios.From identifying customer's in-app purchases or refunds,to providing compensation for a service issueor an outage, or helping them managetheir subscription or request a refund,these questions cover most of the support scenarios,and I'll walk through each scenario in more detail.Let's start with the first scenario,how do you identify the purchases made by a customerwhen they first contact you for support?Now, if you've purchased any content on the App Store,you may already have seen this email.Today, when customers make an in-app purchase,they receive an invoice for that purchase via email.This invoice contains an order ID,which is unique for each invoice.And customers have access to this via email or bylooking at the purchase history under account settings.And now, when a customer contacts you for support,you can ask the customer for the order IDon their invoice and use a new server-to-server APIto lookup in-app purchasesfor the invoice presented by the customer.In addition to validating the invoice,this API also helps you identifyany issues with the in-app purchase.For example, if the invoice containsany purchases that have already been refunded by the App Store.Now, let's take a look at how this API works.So now, when a customer contacts your support team,you can ask the customer for the invoice order ID,and your server can call the invoice lookup API,and, in response, the App Store returns a statusand the transactions for that invoice signed in a JWS format.And finally, using this information,you can provide supportfor the correct in-app purchases.To implement this API on your server,you can call the lookup endpointwith the invoice order ID in the URLand the Apple ID for the app in the request.The response includes a signedTransactions object,which contains the transactions for that invoicesigned in a JWS format.You can decode the payload for each transactionto get the details of the purchase.Now, let's take a closer look at the new status field.This field identifies the overallstatus of the invoice.The possible values are 0, meaning the invoice is validand contains transactions for this order ID,1, meaning the order ID is invalid,and 2, meaning the invoice is valid,but no matching transactions were found for this order ID.Now, let's review an example of how you can usethe response from this API.Here's a sample customer account databasewhere you might be storing the originalTransactionIdfor each customer's in-app purchase,along with the productID and the purchase date.Using this API, you can link the invoice order IDwith the customer's in-app purchaseswhen they contact you about an issue.For example, if this customer purchased coins in your app,and if they contact you for support,you can store the invoice order ID for the purchased coins.Now, let's take a scenario where you havethe originalTransactionId for a customer,and you want to lookup their past refunds.Today, you might be relying on verifyReceipt APIor App Store server notificationsto get notified about refunds.However, if there was an outage, and your server did notreceive any notifications from the App Store,how do you lookup this customer's past refunds?We are introducing a new server-to-server APIto lookup refunded transactions for a customerusing the original transaction IDfor any of their in-app purchases within your app.This API enables you to handle an outageor scheduled maintenance by looking up refundsat any time in a quick and easy manner.Additionally, this API can also help youidentify the customer's entire refund history for your app.For example, if your app offersboth subscriptions and consumables,this API returns all the refunded transactionsacross all your content types.To implement this API on your server,you create the request with original transaction IDin the URL and the Apple ID for the appin the request parameters.The response contains a list of refunded transactionssigned in a JWS format.You can get the all the information neededabout the purchases by decoding the payloadfor each transaction.So, going back to the sample customer account database,you can now use the information returned by this APIto update the refunded transactionsfor this customer using the original transaction ID.Now, after you've identified there was a service issue,how do you compensate customers?Today, there a few different options to consider.For games, you might be providing some formof in-app compensationin the form of virtual currency or content.Or for subscriptions, you may want to offera discount on their next renewal.So, how do you compensate subscribers for a service issue?In iOS 14, we introduced a new featurecalled Subscription Offer Codes to help you acquire,retain, and win back subscribersby providing a subscription at a discountor free for a limited time.You can distribute these unique, one-time codeseither using online or offline channels.And for customer service issues, you can provide offer codesas a compensation for the issue, which helps improve retention.You may also use this as an opportunity to suggestan alternative subscription.For example, a longer duration planthat provides more value at a lower price.And customers on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 and latercan redeem offer codes on the App Storethrough a one-time code redemption URLor within your app, if you've implementedthe presentCodeRedemptionSheet API in StoreKit.Now, let's take a look at a samplecode-redemption flow within your app.The only custom UI you need to create is the onethat initiates the redemption flow.There are several natural places to provide this UI.For example, in your app's settings screenor inside a live-chat functionalitywhen the customer is chatting with your support agent.After the customer taps the redeem button,the system automatically provides a seriesof code-redemption screens, like the ones shown here,for the customer to enter the code and redeem the offer.Now, let's take a look at a scenariowhere there was an outage or an event was canceled,which might be more common for streaming-based apps,such as sports, live TV, or video.For these outages or canceled events,how can you appease customers?We are introducing a new server-to-server APIfor auto-renewable subscriptions,to extend the renewal date for a paid active subscription.With this API, you can offer free service to your customersfor additional time, which can be usedas an appeasement for temporary outages or service issues.You can move the renewal date for a customer's subscriptiontwice per calendar year,each up to 90 days in the future,giving you flexibility to resolve service issuesor outages.Note that the extension period does not count towardsthe one year of paid serviceneeded to receive an 85% proceeds rate.Now, let's see how you can implementthis API on your server.The request for this API requires an originaltransaction ID for the customer's subscription,the extension duration, in days,and a reason code for the extension.The response contains the transaction IDthat was passed in the request,the web order line item ID for the extended renewal,a success flag to indicate whether the request succeededand an effective date for the extensionif the request succeeded.Now, let's take a look at two different scenarioswhere you can use this API.In the first scenario, when a customer contactsyour support team for a service issue or an outage,you can appease the customer by calling this API,and, in response, the App Store extendsthe subscription and notifies the customer via email.Or a second scenario, if there is a cancellationto a sports match due to unforeseen situations,or an interruption to a live-streamed event,your support team can proactively use this API,and in response, the App Store extendsthe subscription and notifies the customers via email.Now, for a scenario where a customer wantsto manage their subscription,how can you enable customers to manage their subscriptionright inside the app?We are introducing a new StoreKit 2 APIto display the manage subscriptions page,which enables you to providesubscription management functionalityright within your app,without redirecting customers to the App Store.Optionally, you can also present a save offer before they seethe manage subscriptions page, or an exit surveyafter they cancel to get the cancellation reason.And with this API, you can also testmanaging subscription purchases in the sandbox environment.This API is really simple to implement,and it takes one line of code.You simply call the showManageSubscriptions()method in StoreKit 2 to display the manage subscriptions page.Now, let's take a look at a sample manage subscription UIin your app.Under account settings, we can add an optionfor the user to manage their subscription.Once the customer taps on this button,the App Store will display the existingmanage subscriptions page,with the currently-active subscriptionand the renewal options.This is the same view customers are familiar withwith when they visit manage subscriptionsunder account settings in the App Store,where they can view, upgrade, downgrade,or cancel their subscription.Now, if the customer selects to cancel their subscription,they will see a confirmation screenwith the cancellation details and the service expiration date.And for any action the user may take on this page,your server will receive an App Storeserver notification, and your app will be notifiedif you've implemented the new StoreKit 2 API.Finally, if a customer is unhappywith their purchase and wants to request a refund,they shouldn't have to leave your app to get help.So, how can you enable customers to request a refundinside your app?We are now introducing a new StoreKit 2 API calledbeginRefundRequest that enables customers to request a refundfor an in-app purchase directly from within your app.And if the refund is approved,your app will be notified and your server receivesa REFUND notification from the App Store.Or if the refund is denied, your server receivesa new REFUND-DECLINED notification.And for the first time, using this API,you can now initiate and test refunds in sandbox,right within the app.To implement this API, you simply callthe beginRefundRequest methodwith the transaction ID for that purchase.And after the request is submitted,you can handle errors using the do-catch statement.For example, if this was a duplicate requestfor a transaction that was already refunded,or if the request failed for some other reason,the error code reflects the status of the refund request.Here's a sample refund request UI in your app.In the Help page, now there's a new optionto "Request a Refund."Upon selection, the app displays purchasesfor that customer to request a refund.And if the power surge purchase did not work as expected,the customer can tap on that purchase to invokea refund request sheet, which contains the purchase detailsand a list of reason codes for the customer to select.Once the request is submitted, in addition tothe in-app confirmation screen,the App Store also sends the customer an emailwith a link to Apple's "Report a Problem,"where they can check the status of their refund.So, with the new APIs, you can now provide contextualand seamless support for in-app purchasesright within your app and across other support channels.Providing good support increases overall retention,improves customer satisfaction,which leads to higher engagement,and ultimately, more positive ratings and reviews.In other words, it's a better experience for everyone.Now, we talked about how you can offer customers a wayto request refunds using the new refund request API,but there is a lot more to refunds that happensafter initiating a request.So, I'm going to invite my colleague, Joe,to talk more about handling refundsand a new opportunity with regards to refund decisioning.Thanks, Manjeet.Hello, my name is Joe Mani,and I'm a program manager at the App Store.Refunds are a sensitive topic,and here at the App Store, we take it seriously.It affects a small percentage of transactions,but we understand the impact it has on your apps.I want to start with a quick recap on refund notifications,which was launched at WWDC20.Then, I will give some insight into how we handle refunds.Finally, we will talk about a new feature,which will help you inform and improve the refund process.In WWDC20, we announced a new notification typecalled REFUND.After a customer is issued a refund,the App Store sends the REFUND notification to your server.If you have configured a server URL in App Store Connect,you may already be receiving REFUND notifications.When your server receives this notification,respond with a successful HTTP status code 200.Then, you can take appropriate actionfor the refund in response.Since the launch of REFUND notifications,we've had a chance to hear your feedback,and I'd like to share some best practices with you.Find the best response strategy that worksfor your business model.For example, if a user purchases in-game currency,and then requests a refund,you can deduct the balance from their accountafter your server receives the REFUND notification.While, for a subscription, you can revoke access to the serviceonce the subscription has been refunded and canceled.Consider the impact on game designwhen identifying your response strategy.Use marketing and promotional toolsto re-engage customers, and always provideclear messaging to your customer acrossyour communication channels on any actions you have taken.Let's look at a sample refund timeline for an appthat offers coins as in-game currency.After a customer purchases 100 coins,they may immediately spend those coins within your game.If the customer then requests a refundusing the new request refund API,or by contacting Apple Support.And if the refund is approved, the App Store willissue a refund, send your server a refund notification,and notifies the customer as well.And this usually happens within a 48-hour window.Now, let's take a look into what happensafter the refund is requestedand before the App Store issues a decision.At a high level, each refund request will go throughour Refund Decisioning System to render a decision.The Refund Decisioning System includes informationabout the transaction at issue and other factors,such as the customer's purchase and refund history.Now, we've heard from you that you like to havea more active role in refund decisions,so we're excited to announce a new feature that willyou improve and inform the refund process.With the new Consumption API, you can share informationabout a customer's in-app purchase with the App Store.When a customer requests a refundfor a consumable in-app purchase,the App Store will send your server a new notificationcalled CONSUMPTION-REQUEST,for you to respond back with the consumption data.In most cases, customers start consuming contentsoon after they purchase it,and knowing this information is helpfulin the refund decision process.Make sure to send consumption information to the App Storewith 12 hours of receiving the CONSUMPTION-REQUEST,so that it can be used to inform the refund decision.Now, let's take a look at what fields are includedwithin the consumption data.The consumption payload contains the following data points,each of which helps to inform the refund decision.First, you include the original transaction IDfor the in-app purchase in the request URL.Set the customerConsented field to "true"if the user has consented to sending the requestedconsumption API data to Apple,in order for Apple to use that data in decisioning.The consumptionStatus field is important.Use it to indicate if the user has consumedthe in-app purchase partially, fully, or not at all.For example, if your app has an exchange platformthat has bartering or has an in-app purchasethat has been transferred from one account to another,it is considered consumed.The consumption platform field identifiesif your app is cross platform and where it was consumed.Use the sampleContent field to indicate if you provideda free sample or trial to the user,or if the user was given a similar in-app purchasewithin the app.Alternatively, use this field to indicateif the user was provided informationabout the in-app purchase and the expected game playor mechanics prior to the purchase.Use the deliveryStatus field to indicatethe in-app purchase was successfully deliveredto the customer and that it functioned properly.The appAccountToken is a new field introduced in StoreKit 2.This will be the UUID associated withthe app's user account that you createthat is initiating the purchaseand consuming the content for the purchase.The remaining fields include information about how longthe user has had an account,how much time they've played in your app,their total spend,and the current status of their account.For a refund request, there are three related App Storeserver notifications:the new CONSUMPTION-REQUEST notificationto notify you when a refund requesthas been initiated for a consumable in-app purchase.For all content types, the REFUND notificationnotifies you when a refund is issued to a customer.And for all content types, the REFUND-DECLINED notificationnotifies you when a refund was declinedfor a request that was initiated using the Store Kit API.Now let's return to the refund timeline.When the customer requests a refundfor a consumable in-app purchase,the App Store server will now send your servera consumption request notification.Your server responds back within 12 hourswith the consumption data back to the App Store server,which will then be used for decisioning.If it is approved, the App Store will sendthe REFUND notification,and after your server respondswith an HTTP OK response,you can take appropriate action for that refund.And the consumption API is availableboth in production and to test in sandbox as of today.Now let's cover some of the benefitsof sending information to Applewith the new Consumption API.Obtaining these data points will help increase transparencyand improve our overall refund process.This, in turn, provides a better overall outcometo your customers.Also, with the new REFUND notification,you have more opportunities to reach your customer,thus increasing the overall communication.Now, I'd like to pass it back to my colleague, Manjeet,to share some key take-aways from everything we've covered.So, we covered a lot of topics today.Let me go through the key takeaways for this session.With the new StoreKit APIs, you can now implementa custom help UI in your appfor customers to request a refundand for subscriptions, a way to managetheir subscription within the app.Review and optimize your customer support journeysby implementing the new server-to-server APIs.For example, use the invoice lookup APIto identify and validate a customer's in-app purchase.And if you haven't already, setup your serverto receive the refund, consumption request,and other status update notificationsfrom the App Store.Identify the response strategy that works bestfor your app's business model to take action upon refunds.And finally, you can now inform Apple'srefund decisioning systemby responding to consumption request notificationsfrom the App Store by sending latest consumption data.So, this was "Support customers and handle refunds."For more information on the new StoreKit 2 APIs,watch "Meet StoreKit 2,"and for more information on building server-side logicfor in-app purchases,watch "Manage in-app purchases on your server."Thanks for listening today, and enjoy the rest of WWDC.[percussive music]

Hello, and welcome to WWDC.My name is Manjeet Chawla, a technical program managerat the App Store, and I'm really excitedto talk about some new features that will help yousupport customers and handle

issueor an outage, or helping them managetheir subscription or request a refund,these questions cover most of the support scenarios,and I'll walk through each scenario in more detail.Let's start with the first scenario,how do you identify the purchases made by a customerwhen they first contact you for support?Now, if you've purchased any content on the App Store,you may already have seen this email.Today, when customers make an in-app purchase,they receive an invoice for that purchase via email.This invoice contains an order ID,which is unique for each invoice.And customers have access to

invoice is validand contains transactions for this order ID,1, meaning the order ID is invalid,and 2, meaning the invoice is valid,but no matching transactions were found for this order ID.Now, let's review an example of how you can usethe response from this API.Here's a sample customer account databasewhere you might be storing the originalTransactionIdfor each customer's in-app purchase,along with the productID and the purchase date.Using this API, you can link the invoice order IDwith the customer's in-app purchaseswhen they contact you about an issue.For example, if this customer

going back to the sample customer account database,you can now use the information returned by this APIto update the refunded transactionsfor this customer using the original transaction ID.

Now, after you've identified there was a service issue,how do you compensate customers?Today, there a few different options to consider.For games, you might be providing some formof in-app compensationin the form of virtual currency or content.Or for subscriptions, you may want to offera discount on their next renewal.So, how do you compensate subscribers for a service issue?In iOS 14, we introduced a new featurecalled Subscription Offer Codes to help you acquire,retain, and win back subscribersby providing a subscription at a discountor free for a limited time.You can distribute these unique, one-time codeseither using online or offline channels.And for customer service issues, you can provide offer codesas a compensation for the issue, which helps improve retention.You may also use this as an opportunity to suggestan alternative subscription.For example, a longer duration planthat provides more value at a lower price.And customers on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 and latercan redeem offer codes on the App Storethrough a one-time code redemption URLor within your app, if you've implementedthe presentCodeRedemptionSheet API in StoreKit.Now, let's take a look at a samplecode-redemption flow within your app.The only custom UI you need to create is the onethat initiates the redemption flow.There are several natural places to provide this UI.For example, in your app's settings screenor inside a live-chat functionalitywhen the customer is chatting with your support agent.After the customer taps the redeem button,the system automatically provides a seriesof code-redemption screens, like the ones shown here,for the customer to enter the code and redeem the offer.

Now, let's take a look at a scenariowhere there was an outage or an event was canceled,which might be more common for streaming-based apps,such as sports, live TV, or video.For these outages or canceled events,how can you appease customers?We are introducing a new server-to-server APIfor auto-renewable subscriptions,to extend the renewal date for a paid active subscription.With this API, you can offer free service to your customersfor additional time, which can be usedas an appeasement for temporary outages or service issues.You can move the renewal date for a customer's subscriptiontwice per calendar year,each up to 90 days in the future,giving you flexibility to resolve service issuesor outages.Note that the extension period does not count towardsthe one year of paid serviceneeded to receive an 85% proceeds rate.Now, let's see how you can implementthis API on your server.The request for this API requires an originaltransaction ID for the customer's subscription,the extension duration, in days,and a reason code for the extension.The response contains the transaction IDthat was passed in the request,the web order line item ID for the extended renewal,a success flag to indicate whether the request succeededand an effective date for the extensionif the request succeeded.Now, let's take a look at two different scenarioswhere you can use this API.In the first scenario, when a customer contactsyour support team for a service issue or an outage,you can appease the customer by calling this API,and, in response, the App Store extendsthe subscription and notifies the customer via email.Or a second scenario, if there is a cancellationto a sports match due to unforeseen situations,or an interruption to a live-streamed event,your support team can proactively use this API,and in response, the App Store extendsthe subscription and notifies the customers via email.

affects a small percentage of transactions,but we understand the impact it has on your apps.I want to start with a quick recap on refund notifications,which was launched at WWDC20.Then, I will give some insight into how we handle refunds.Finally, we will talk about a new feature,which will help you inform and improve the refund process.In WWDC20, we announced a new notification typecalled REFUND.After a customer is issued a refund,the App Store sends the REFUND notification to your server.If you have configured a server URL in App Store Connect,you may already be receiving REFUND notifications.When your server receives this notification,respond with a successful HTTP status code 200.Then, you can take appropriate actionfor the refund in response.Since the launch of REFUND notifications,we've had a chance to hear your feedback,and I'd like to share some best practices with you.Find the best response strategy that worksfor your business model.For example, if a user purchases in-game currency,and then requests a refund,you can deduct the balance from their accountafter your server receives the REFUND notification.While, for a subscription, you can revoke access to the serviceonce the subscription has been refunded and canceled.Consider the impact on game designwhen identifying your response strategy.Use marketing and promotional toolsto re-engage customers, and always provideclear messaging to your customer acrossyour communication channels on any actions you have taken.

Let's look at a sample refund timeline for an appthat offers coins as in-game currency.After a customer purchases 100 coins,they may immediately spend those coins within your game.If the customer then requests a refundusing the new request refund API,or by contacting Apple Support.And if the refund is approved, the App Store willissue a refund, send your server a refund notification,and notifies the customer as well.And this usually happens within a 48-hour window.Now, let's take a look into what happensafter the refund is requestedand before the App Store issues a decision.At a high level, each refund request will go throughour Refund Decisioning System to render a decision.The Refund Decisioning System includes informationabout the transaction at issue and other factors,such as the customer's purchase and refund history.Now, we've heard from you that you like to havea more active role in refund decisions,so we're excited to announce a new feature that willyou improve and inform the refund process.With the new Consumption API, you can share informationabout a customer's in-app purchase with the App Store.When a customer requests a refundfor a consumable in-app purchase,the App Store will send your server a new notificationcalled CONSUMPTION-REQUEST,for you to respond back with the consumption data.In most cases, customers start consuming contentsoon after they purchase it,and knowing this information is helpfulin the refund decision process.Make sure to send consumption information to the App Storewith 12 hours of receiving the CONSUMPTION-REQUEST,so that it can be used to inform the refund decision.Now, let's take a look at what fields are includedwithin the consumption data.The consumption payload contains the following data points,each of which helps to inform the refund decision.

First, you include the original transaction IDfor the in-app purchase in the request URL.Set the customerConsented field to "true"if the user has consented to sending the requestedconsumption API data to Apple,in order for Apple to use that data in decisioning.The consumptionStatus field is important.Use it to indicate if the user has consumedthe in-app purchase partially, fully, or not at all.For example, if your app has an exchange platformthat has bartering or has an in-app purchasethat has been transferred from one account to another,it is considered consumed.The consumption platform field identifiesif your app is cross platform and where it was consumed.Use the sampleContent field to indicate if you provideda free sample or trial to the user,or if the user was given a similar in-app purchasewithin the app.Alternatively, use this field to indicateif the user was provided informationabout the in-app purchase and the expected game playor mechanics prior to the purchase.Use the deliveryStatus field to indicatethe in-app purchase was successfully deliveredto the customer and that it functioned properly.The appAccountToken is a new field introduced in StoreKit 2.This will be the UUID associated withthe app's user account that you createthat is initiating the purchaseand consuming the content for the purchase.The remaining fields include information about how longthe user has had an account,how much time they've played in your app,their total spend,and the current status of their account.For a refund request, there are three related App Storeserver notifications:the new CONSUMPTION-REQUEST notificationto notify you when a refund requesthas been initiated for a consumable in-app purchase.For all content types, the REFUND notificationnotifies you when a refund is issued to a customer.And for all content types, the REFUND-DECLINED notificationnotifies you when a refund was declinedfor a request that was initiated using the Store Kit API.Now let's return to the refund timeline.When the customer requests a refundfor a consumable in-app purchase,the App Store server will now send your servera consumption request notification.Your server responds back within 12 hourswith the consumption data back to the App Store server,which will then be used for decisioning.If it is approved, the App Store will sendthe REFUND notification,and after your server respondswith an HTTP OK response,you can take appropriate action for that refund.

And the consumption API is availableboth in production and to test in sandbox as of today.Now let's cover some of the benefitsof sending information to Applewith the new Consumption API.Obtaining these data points will help increase transparencyand improve our overall refund process.This, in turn, provides a better overall outcometo your customers.Also, with the new REFUND notification,you have more opportunities to reach your customer,thus increasing the overall communication.Now, I'd like to pass it back to my colleague, Manjeet,to share some key take-aways from everything we've covered.So, we covered a lot of topics today.Let me go through the key takeaways for this session.With the new StoreKit APIs, you can now implementa custom help UI in your appfor customers to request a refundand for subscriptions, a way to managetheir subscription within the app.Review and optimize your customer support journeysby implementing the new server-to-server APIs.For example, use the invoice lookup APIto identify and validate a customer's in-app purchase.And if you haven't already, setup your serverto receive the refund, consumption request,and other status update notificationsfrom the App Store.Identify the response strategy that works bestfor your app's business model to take action upon refunds.And finally, you can now inform Apple'srefund decisioning systemby responding to consumption request notificationsfrom the App Store by sending latest consumption data.So, this was "Support customers and handle refunds."For more information on the new StoreKit 2 APIs,watch "Meet StoreKit 2,"and for more information on building server-side logicfor in-app purchases,watch "Manage in-app purchases on your server."Thanks for listening today, and enjoy the rest of WWDC.[percussive music]
