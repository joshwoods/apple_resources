coming soon.Introducing this year,one of your most popular request:TestFlight on Mac.TestFlight lets you distribute beta builds of your appto testers and collect valuable feedback.It's been available on iOS and tvOS,and now we are bringing it to MacOS coming this fall.TestFlight on Mac provides all the same capabilitiesyou have on iOS and tvOS,and it will be available to downloadon the Mac App Store.You can install beta apps,setup automatic updates,and share feedback.It supports native Mac apps and iOS appson Apple Silicon Mac.First let's take a look at installing beta apps.You can recruit testersby sending an email inviteor by sharing a public link.Once they accept the invite,they become a tester for your app.They can browse through different buildsgrouped by versionsto choose a specific build to testand click the install button to downloadand start testing on Mac.Once a beta app is installed,it can be launched from TestFlight anytime.It can also be launched by all meanslike Dock, Launchpad, and Finder.To make it easy to recognize it as a beta app,we show a yellow dot next to the app namein the Dock, in Launchpad,and as a Beta Application in Finder.Testers can configure automatic updatesto have the latest available buildsinstall automatically.This will ensure they are testingthe latest build of your app.While testing a beta version of an app,your testers can send you feedbackabout issues they experienceor make suggestions for improvements.They can send feedback directly from your appsimply by taking a screenshot,attaching it,adding in the comments to describe the issue,and then submit.You can view this feedbackin App Store Connectunder the Screenshot Feedback section.If the beta app crashes,then TestFlight automatically captures the crash logsand provides a dialogfor testers to enter additional comments.You can download the crash logsand see the feedbackunder App Store Connect crashes feedback sectionand in Xcode Organizer.So that's a brief overview of the main featuresof TestFlight on Mac,which helps you test the appsand collect valuable feedback.Now, let's take a look at how native Mac appsand iOS apps on Apple Silicon Maccan be set up for TestFlightfollowed by improved internal group managementand built-in Xcode Cloud features.OK, let's get into the detailsabout distributing native Mac apps with TestFlight.Native Mac apps require a provisioning profileto be distributed with TestFlight on Mac.We will create and include the provisioning profilefor your appswhen you use Xcode Automatically manage signing.If your apps manage signing manually,you have to add the profile explicitly.How to create and upload a profile manuallyis documented in the Developer portal.Once uploaded with a provisioning profile,the builds will be displayed under macOS.You can create groups to manage testersand distribute each one,very similar to iOS or tvOS.For each build,you can view the number of invited testers,installations on devices,sessions in the last seven days,crashes, and feedback count.These numbers are aggregated across all of the testers.When you are looking at App Store Connectcrashes or screenshots feedback section,you can filter by selecting the platform macOS.You can further filter the feedbackby selecting a specific Mac device or MacOS version.As you see, native Mac apps distribution with TestFlightis very similar to iOS and tvOS.Let's see how iOS apps on Apple Silicon Macscan be distributed with TestFlight.For each tester group,you can control the TestFlight availabilityof iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs.When enabled, the iOS builds in this groupare available to TestFlight on Apple Silicon Macs.When this is disabled,all iOS builds from that groupwill stop being available on Mac.This provides more flexibilityto control who can test the iOS appson Apple Silicon Macs.The iOS builds are displayed similar to today,but the counts displayed will include the numbersfrom the Apple Silicon Macs as well.Similarly, you can seethe crashes and screenshots feedbackat App Store Connectunder the platform iOSand will include feedbacksubmitted from Apple Silicon Macs.It's that simple to make iOS appsdistribute with TestFlight on Apple Silicon Mac.Internal testing has always made testingwith your App Store Connect team convenient.This year, we have made new improvementsto make internal group management even more flexible.And it's applicable for all supported platforms.You can now create multiple internal groupssimilar to external groups.You can also configure distribution of buildsand collection of feedback per internal group.For example, let's say you havea Development Team and a QA Team.You can now create an internal groupfor each of them.You can give the Development Teamaccess to all builds as part of the development life cycle,while the QA Team may only require accessto specific stable builds.For the Development Team,you would enable the automatic distribution flagto make all current and future buildsavailable to this group,whereas for the QA team,you would choose to manually add specific builds.Now that you saw how internal groupscan be configured per use case,I want to show you how to set it up.You can create the groups for each teamby clicking on the plus button next to Internal Testing.Now give your internal group a name.For the Dev Team,choose Enable automatic distribution.While for QA Team,you can uncheck Enable automatic distributionand click Create.Once the groups are created,for QA team,you can click on the plus button tomanually select the builds to be added to the group.Then for each group,you can click on the plus button next to Testersto manually select the onesapplicable for the groups and add them.You also have the optionto enable or disable the feedback per group,just like external testing.If you use the App Store Connect API,you can manage internal groups with different configurationsthrough the BetaGroups Resource.Similarly if you use App Store Connect on iOS,they can also be managed from there.Well, these are the major improvementsto make internal testing more flexible.Lastly, we have integrated exciting Xcode Cloud featuresdirectly into TestFlight.This week, Apple introduced Xcode Cloud.Xcode Cloud integrates with TestFlightand provides a seamless experienceto automatically build, test, and distribute your apps.To learn more about Xcode Cloud,check out the session "Meet Xcode Cloud."First, Xcode Cloud manages beta build distributionthrough TestFlight to provide a seamless experienceby automatically distributing builds to specific beta groups.Second, your builds are organized in the wayyour development team works via Build Groups.Let me show you how it looks likein App Store Connect.Here is the Builds Groups view, where you will find buildsgrouped by the Xcode Cloud workflow and GIT branch.They are supportedin the App Store Connect app on iOS, too.For internal testers on TestFlight,the Build Groups display makes it easierto find builds based on the more familiar GIT branch namesand Xcode Cloud workflows for internal testing.You can also filter feedback by a specific Build Groupunder the Feedback section in App Store Connect.Well, these are the amazing featuresof TestFlight coming soon this year.TestFlight on Mac supports both native Mac appsand iOS apps on Apple Silicon Macs.You can start beta testing on Mac coming fall.Improve internal group managementto create multiple groups as per your needs.And finally,Xcode Cloud integrates with App Store Connectand TestFlight to manage build distributionand organize them by build groups.You can sign up for Xcode Cloud Beta today.I think you will enjoy all the new featuresadded this yearand have an amazing TestFlight experience.Try them out and give us your feedback.Thank you very much.[upbeat music]

Welcome to the session "Meet TestFlight on Mac."I'm Shobi Vijayakumar,TestFlight Engineering Manager.I'm really excited to share with youabout the amazing new TestFlight features coming soon.

Introducing this year,one of your most popular request:TestFlight on Mac.TestFlight lets you distribute beta builds of your appto testers and collect valuable feedback.It's been available on iOS and tvOS,and now we are bringing it to MacOS coming this fall.

TestFlight on Mac provides all the same capabilitiesyou have on iOS and tvOS,and it will be available to downloadon the Mac App Store.You can install beta apps,setup automatic updates,and share feedback.It supports native Mac apps and iOS appson Apple Silicon Mac.

First let's take a look at installing beta apps.You can recruit testersby sending an email inviteor by sharing a public link.Once they accept the invite,they become a tester for your app.

They can browse through different buildsgrouped by versionsto choose a specific build to testand click the install button to downloadand start testing on Mac.

Once a beta app is installed,it can be launched from TestFlight anytime.It can also be launched by all meanslike Dock, Launchpad, and Finder.

To make it easy to recognize it as a beta app,we show a yellow dot next to the app namein the Dock, in Launchpad,and as a Beta Application in Finder.

Testers can configure automatic updatesto have the latest available buildsinstall automatically.This will ensure they are testingthe latest build of your app.While testing a beta version of an app,your testers can send you feedbackabout issues they experienceor make suggestions for improvements.They can send feedback directly from your appsimply by taking a screenshot,attaching it,adding in the comments to describe the issue,and then submit.You can view this feedbackin App Store Connectunder the Screenshot Feedback section.If the beta app crashes,then TestFlight automatically captures the crash logsand provides a dialogfor testers to enter additional comments.You can download the crash logsand see the feedbackunder App Store Connect crashes feedback sectionand in Xcode Organizer.

So that's a brief overview of the main featuresof TestFlight on Mac,which helps you test the appsand collect valuable feedback.Now, let's take a look at how native Mac appsand iOS apps on Apple Silicon Maccan be set up for TestFlightfollowed by improved internal group managementand built-in Xcode Cloud features.OK, let's get into the detailsabout distributing native Mac apps with TestFlight.

Native Mac apps require a provisioning profileto be distributed with TestFlight on Mac.We will create and include the provisioning profilefor your appswhen you use Xcode Automatically manage signing.If your apps manage signing manually,you have to add the profile explicitly.How to create and upload a profile manuallyis documented in the Developer portal.

When you are looking at App Store Connectcrashes or screenshots feedback section,you can filter by selecting the platform macOS.You can further filter the feedbackby selecting a specific Mac device or MacOS version.

As you see, native Mac apps distribution with TestFlightis very similar to iOS and tvOS.Let's see how iOS apps on Apple Silicon Macscan be distributed with TestFlight.

For each tester group,you can control the TestFlight availabilityof iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs.

When enabled, the iOS builds in this groupare available to TestFlight on Apple Silicon Macs.When this is disabled,all iOS builds from that groupwill stop being available on Mac.This provides more flexibilityto control who can test the iOS appson Apple Silicon Macs.The iOS builds are displayed similar to today,but the counts displayed will include the numbersfrom the Apple Silicon Macs as well.

This week, Apple introduced Xcode Cloud.

Xcode Cloud integrates with TestFlightand provides a seamless experienceto automatically build, test, and distribute your apps.To learn more about Xcode Cloud,check out the session "Meet Xcode Cloud."First, Xcode Cloud manages beta build distributionthrough TestFlight to provide a seamless experienceby automatically distributing builds to specific beta groups.Second, your builds are organized in the wayyour development team works via Build Groups.

Let me show you how it looks likein App Store Connect.

Here is the Builds Groups view, where you will find buildsgrouped by the Xcode Cloud workflow and GIT branch.

They are supportedin the App Store Connect app on iOS, too.

For internal testers on TestFlight,the Build Groups display makes it easierto find builds based on the more familiar GIT branch namesand Xcode Cloud workflows for internal testing.

You can also filter feedback by a specific Build Groupunder the Feedback section in App Store Connect.

Well, these are the amazing featuresof TestFlight coming soon this year.TestFlight on Mac supports both native Mac appsand iOS apps on Apple Silicon Macs.You can start beta testing on Mac coming fall.Improve internal group managementto create multiple groups as per your needs.And finally,Xcode Cloud integrates with App Store Connectand TestFlight to manage build distributionand organize them by build groups.You can sign up for Xcode Cloud Beta today.
