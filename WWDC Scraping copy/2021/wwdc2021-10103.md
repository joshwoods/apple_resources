presentation,I will cover on three main areas,beginning with a bit of background on the path to 5Gand why we think it’s a big deal.I will share how iPadOS and iOSbalance network performance and battery lifeall while preserving a great user experience,and leave you with some practical guidanceyou can use to ensure your app is optimized for 5G.So let me begin with the path to 5G.For me, one of the best ways to convey the potentialof modern 5G networks is to take a step back.Now, I’m guessing not many of youowned one of these sweet portable phones.But, I think it’s important to understandthat they were a big deal in their day.With this handy device, you could actuallymake a telephone call while on the go.And while, of course, our modern iPhonestill lets you make calls, so much of the otheramazing things you can do with your iPhoneis the result of advances in networking technology.Each step in network evolution has broughtdramatically new capabilities to mobile devices.2G networks, for example, were the first networksto provide data services for mobile.So not only could you make a phone call,but you could do dramatically new thingssuch as having a voice-free conversationby sending SMS text messages;capture pictures and immediately send them to your friends;or deliver a variety of media,including up to multiple images, video, and audio,all at the blistering speed of up to 384 kilobits per second.And while this is probably considered slow,the fact you could do these amazing new thingswith a mobile device meant the performance of the networkdidn’t really matter as much.But of course, once we developershave access to a network,our goal is to push it to its limits.So 2G networks really were only the beginningof a continuous strive to deliver more data, faster.3G came along with primary focus on data connectivityand unlocked new capabilitiessuch as video calls, mobile TV, and even internet access.Imagine what a breakthrough 3G was at the time!Having a web browser on your phone was amazing;it put the entire internet in your pocket!4G -- or what’s more commonly called LTE -- came next,and with it, data rates improved even more.LTE enabled reliable mobile voice over IP communication,support for streaming high-quality video,and many other data-intensive user experienceswe’ve come to lovelike communicating with your family using FaceTime videoor exploring shared augmented reality experiencesor real-time multiplayer games and more.Those fantastic new experiences that we’ve come to rely onwere made possible by the dramatic increasein network performance over the previous generation.But again, we are always looking to push the envelope;to deliver more services and breakthrough experiences,and of course, deliver them at faster speeds.And that brings us to the latest technology in networking, 5G.5G continues the evolutionof our ever-increasing need for speed.And if you step back and take a look at network performanceover these generations, you can see each new generationdelivered a remarkable increase in speedat which the data can be delivered.Each jump in speed leads to a leap in the possibilitiesfor you to provide richer --or in many cases, previously impossible --experiences in your app.But while 5G is an incredible jump in performancefrom a network bandwidth perspective,5G provides other advancesbeyond just more data at a faster rate.So not only can you exchange data faster,but you’ll have faster round-trip timesbetween your app and your server.And faster round trips mean fasterand more synchronized transactions.5G’s ability to handle more devices concurrentlymeans you can continue to deliverdata-related services in your app,even in congested public environmentssuch as sports stadiums, convention arenas,and other crowded public venues --remember those?And given that 5G’s performance is 10 times betterthan a typical public Wi-Fi,this means your customers won’t have to hop onpotentially insecure Wi-Fi hotspotsjust to quickly exchange larger files.So that was a brief review of the network generationsleading to 5G, each leap in performanceresulting in increased opportunitiesfor app developers like you to push the envelopeand deliver previously unheard-of experiencesin your app.Now, I’d like to transitionfrom a focus on performance of the networkto describe the services we’ve built into iOSthat ensure your app will perform optimally,regardless of the network environment.Looking back at the major milestones of networking,it is easy to think that as each new network came into being,the previous network disappeared into the dustbin of history.But like any evolutionary process,there are always portions of the past in the next generation.So the reality is that today’s modern 5G cellular networkscan be a bit of an amalgam,but come primarily in two varieties,commonly referred to as Non-Standalone and Standalone --or even more commonly referred to as NSA and SA.Non-Standalone is built on the existing LTE coreand can use both LTE and 5G links to schedule traffic,operates at frequencies below seven gigahertz,and includes support for millimeter wave.Standalone is built entirely on the new 5G core,also operates at frequencies below seven gigahertz,and includes support for millimeter wave,and delivers improved latency performance over LTE.These unique characteristics of 5G deploymentsplay a critical role in determiningthe network performance of your app.And the upside is huge,especially with ideal theoretical speedsof up to 4 gigabits per second.And this real-world test I recently ran at Apple Parkshows me getting close,clocking in at a wicked fast 3 gigabits per second!That’s 20 times faster than LTE.And with a ping latency of seven milliseconds,it’s pretty obvious there’s a lot you can do with 5G.However, while 5G deployments provide lower latencyand faster data speeds,they are inherently more power hungry.Sure, the people using your app want a superfast experience,but not necessarily at the expense of battery life.So we’ve taken this desire for a balancebetween power and performance into considerationand made optimizations at the system levelso you can focus on user experience.If we go back to look at our 5G deploymentsand toss public Wi-Fi networks into the mix,you can see there’s a range of network typeswith varied performance characteristicsthat we can pick from to provide the best connection speedfor a given task in your app.And we pick the best network using two techniquescalled "Automatic Switch to 5G" and "Smart Data Mode."Both technologies look at a combination of performance,security, and power characteristicsto enable the best wireless connection for your app,be it Wi-Fi, LTE, or 5G.In addition to constantly evaluatingthe relative performance of LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi,Smart Data Mode can detect network congestionon any network and move your connectionto the wireless interface with the least resistance.They also look at the security of the availableWi-Fi connection with the assumptionthat public Wi-Fi at airports, coffee shops, et ceteraare usually less secure than cellularand typically provide very low data speeds.And battery considerations also take into accountthe most power-efficient networkfor a given task within your app,such as switching to 5G knowing it’s more efficientfor large file use cases like movie downloads,or switching to LTE for low data-intensive tasks,like those typically run in the background.So with all the built-in servicesmanaging the network interface on your behalf,it’s easy to ignore the type of network altogether.And with that review of the built-in features,I have a perfect segue to provide some practical guidancefor ensuring your app is optimized for 5G.And I’ve already hinted at the first best practicein the previous section.With the system choosing the best network on your behalf,you should stop even considering the network type.Using network type to drive behavioris just about guaranteed to prevent your appfrom accessing the potential 5G benefits.Also, don’t assume if Wi-Fi is available, cellular isn’tbecause we support multiple network paths.My next best practice is to use our frameworksto take full advantage of 5G.For example, you should be using AVFoundation,like we do on Apple TV and in Apple Music,to stream high-quality audio and video;or CallKit to take advantage of the noticeableenhancements we’ve added for VOIP apps on 5G.Using high-level network APIs such as URLSessionand the Network framework, we’ve been able to tunemany of our apps to take full advantage of 5G.Apple News will cache articles over 5G for offline reading.Now your favorite photos get synced to iCloudover the inexpensive 5G link.And we’ve enabled automatic backup and restore over 5Gwhen Wi-Fi isn’t available.My third best practice is to tune your applicationfor constrained and expensive paths.In most cases, expensive and constrainedare automatically derived by the systembased on the active cellular plan.However, the user can also affect theseby altering the Data Mode settings on their device.There are three options: Allow More Data on 5G,indicating an inexpensive path, similar to Wi-Fi;Standard mode,which is usually considered as expensive;and Low Data Mode, which is considered constrained.The concept of expensive and constrainedare surfaced as propertiesin all our high-level networking frameworks.And the value of these propertiesshould be your only considerationwhen determining the type of network servicesavailable for your app.For example, URLSession allows youto take advantage of these propertiesto manage networking requests.In order to benefit from inexpensive networking over 5G,we recommend you useallowsExpensiveNetworkAccessinstead of relying on network type checks.In addition, if your application implements policybased on expensive,provide a way for users to influence that policy.In Network.framework, you have another optionto check for constrained, expensive, and inexpensive path.And finally, if your app uses AVFoundation,there are similar caseindicating constrained and expensive here as well.So those are my best practices for ensuring your appis ready to take advantage of 5G.The key takeaway ideally is to let the operating systemand iOS frameworks do the heavy lifting.We’ve covered a fair amount in this session,from a bit of a history lesson to a deep diveon how the system works, to some tips to make sureyou are getting the most out of the network.But before I sign off,let me leave you with a few key takeaways.First, 5G is here.While you may not have it available in your neighborhood,a good percentage of your customers do --or it’s just around the corner --so you want to be ready.Remember that we are continually working on waysto leverage our unique combinationof hardware and softwareto ensure a high-performance user experiencewhile maintaining the longest possible battery life.And by using our high-level frameworks,your app can benefit with minimal effort.And finally, we’re always looking for waysto engage with you.So please give us

♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Rajesh Ambati: Hi, I am Raj Ambati.

I lead 5G software development at Appleand I’m excited to talk to you about 5G,so let’s dig in.

Over the course of this short presentation,I will cover on three main areas,beginning with a bit of background on the path to 5Gand why we think it’s a big deal.
