Search this video…♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Beatriz Magalhães: Hi, my name is Bea,and I'm a human interface designeron the Documentation team.My colleague Jack and I are going to talk abouthow to elevate your DocC documentation in Xcode.It’s now easier than everto write and share great documentation.This year, we’ve integrated documentationfor your Swift frameworks right into Xcode 13.In this session, we'll enhance the documentationof a framework we created: SlothCreator.You can use SlothCreatorto catalog sloths you find in natureand to create new adorable virtual sloths.To make our existing documentationfor this framework better,we'll go over what documentation page types are availablein Xcode 13and how to choose what's best for your content,how to organize the order of your APIsto tell a story about your framework,and how extensions can give you flexibilityin how you write your documentation.I’ll start with a new Xcode feature:documentation page types.Xcode 13 has a brand-new feature called "Documentation Catalog,"which enables you to create three page types you can viewon the documentation window or on the web:reference, articles, and tutorials.Each project is unique and has different needs,but it’s usually good to have a diverse set of documentation.Reference provides concise, in-depth informationabout individual APIs in your library.This allows you to add text descriptions,code snippets, and relationships between different symbols.This is the backbone of your documentation.Articles are pages with free-form content.They’re great at giving the big picture of how a framework worksand explaining how to complete a specific task.They often connect the dots between different symbols.Tutorials are a step-by-step walk-through of a projectthat uses your framework.It's great to understandhow a combination of symbols work togetherby implementing it in practice.Framework adopters of all proficiency levelscan benefit from tutorials, but it’s worth notingthis is also a very beginner-friendly format.In this session, we’ll focus on articles.To see information on reference and tutorials,check out these other WWDC sessions.Before I start enhancing my SlothCreator documentation,I’ll check out what’s new in the documentation window.Now, you can see all of the Apple technologiesas well as your own documentationright there in the navigator.Now, I’ll check out the current stateof my SlothCreator documentation.I have my SlothCreator Swift package open in Xcode.I'm going to click on Productand then Build Documentationto bring up my documentation window.Scrolling through my SlothCreatorframework documentation,I see that all my symbols are already coveredby reference here, which is great.However, if I approach this page from the perspective of someonewho's never used this framework before,it's not clear at a glance what it does.I can use a top-level article to paint the big picture.Top-level articles have a concise summary sentence,an overview with content like images and code snippets,and on the bottom,a topics section with a few symbols you want to highlight.To add an article,I need to set up my project with a documentation catalog.The documentation catalog is a file in the Xcode navigatorthat contains all my documentation files.Moreover, it lets me write new page types.This makes documentation quick to access at a glanceand makes it easier for me to prioritize documentationin my day-to-day workflow.To do this, I can right-clickon the SlothCreator Sources directory,which contains the sources for our SlothCreator target,and select New File.Then, I’ll scroll through the listuntil I find Documentation Catalog.I’ll name it to match my framework target:SlothCreator.Xcode gives me a top-level articlewhen I create a documentation catalog.I’ll rename it to "SlothCreator"both in the project navigator and in the markdown.Now, let’s get started on our article.You write articles using Markdown.First, I’m going to add a summarythat describes what my framework does in one sentence.Next, I'll add more in-depth informationunder the Overview title about the main functionalitiesof SlothCreator: research, care, and visualization.Lastly, I’m going to add an imageso developers know at a glance what they’re looking at.I’d recommend adding images that are 2x in resolutionand either Dark Mode-compatible or have a Dark Mode alternative.Don’t forget to include the proper naming conventionsfor your files.First, the name of your file: "sloth."Then, if your image is in Dark Mode,a tilde and the word "dark."Then, @2x to describe the scale factor.And lastly, your image file format,which in this case is .png.Now that I made sure my images are the right sizeand are named correctly, I’m going to open Finderand drag my assets into the Resources folderof my documentation catalog.Next, I’ll add my image to the article Markdown.First, I added an exclamation point,then a description between bracketsto make my image accessible,and lastly, the file name between parentheses.You might have noticedI didn’t type in "@2x" or "~dark."That’s because Xcode automatically selects the image,so all I have to type in is the image name itself.All right, I finished my top-level article.Let’s see what it looks like by building my documentation.I’ll click on Product and select Build Documentation againto bring up my documentation window.Awesome, SlothCreator has a clear high-level summary,an overview that gives more contexton what this framework is for,and an image that illustratesthe core concept of the framework at a glance.Now, someone that’s never used SlothCreator beforecan quickly understand the big pictureof what the framework does.I can make this documentation even betterby providing actionable first stepson how to get started with SlothCreator.A task article could help with that.I’ve prepared a task article ahead of time,and I’m going to open Finderand drag it into my SlothCreator documentation catalog.This article has the goal of teaching folkshow to create and care for a sloth,the core element of this framework.In terms of structure,it’s very similar to the top-level article.Both types can include text, images, and code snippets.The biggest difference here is in the content.To see those differences, I’ll build my documentation againby selecting Product and Build Documentation.Then, in my documentation window navigator,I’m going to select Getting Started with Sloths.Great, this article provides more contextaround how to create a sloth,by describing its properties and traits.It also gives actionable steps on how to care for the slothand form a suitable habitat.This will help people to adopt SlothCreator much faster.To recap,so far, I talked about all the different types of documentationyou can author and what you can use each one for.I introduced a new Xcode 13 featurecalled "Documentation Catalog,"which allows you to put all your documentation filesin the same placeas well as author new types of documentation.And I used it to create two articlesthat enhance my documentation by giving it more contextand diving in a specific task.To author those articles, I used Markdownand the new files that we’re now supporting for documentation.Now, I'm going to hand it over to Jack,so he can talk about how you can make your docs even betterby organizing your symbolsand creating documentation extensions.Jack Lawrence: Thanks, Bea, those articles look great.Now that we’ve added some new pages,there’s another way I can help guide everyonethrough the framework.Earlier, Bea created a framework pagewith an overview for SlothCreator.At the bottom of the page,the DocC compiler automatically created a topics sectionwith all of the Sloth framework’s documentation.This is a great start, but I think we can improve it.So let’s take a step back and think about the storywe want to tell.SlothCreator APIs fall into three main categories:researching and creating sloths,caring for the health and happiness of your sloth,and viewing your sloth in its habitat.I can use these categoriesto organize the documentation pages in SlothCreator.Here are the top-level pages for the framework.First, I’ll put aside all but the most important pages.I can organize supporting types --like speed and color --under another page later.Next, I’ll organize the remaining pagesinto groupings centered around the features of SlothCreator.And finally, I’ll sort the groups and pagesfrom least to most advanced.This new organization looks a lot more approachable,and framework adopters interested in specific featureswill know right where to look.Now we’ll update the documentationfor the framework to use these themes.I have the SlothCreator project openand the built documentation.The compiler automatically adds a topics section to each pagewith default groups.But I can customize it with some extra Markdown.Earlier, Bea created a documentation catalogwith a framework article.In the project navigator,I’ll select the SlothCreator Markdown fileinside the documentation catalog.The template already includes a topics sectionfor me to fill out.Starting with "Essentials,"I’ll update the group title in the third-level heading.Then I’ll add a list of links to include in the group.I’ll begin with the "Getting Started" article,and the sloth type.To link to an article,I use the name of the file without the extension,using the doc URL scheme.To link to a symbol,I surround the name of the symbol in double back ticks.Using the categories I created earlier,I’ll organize all of the other documentation pages into groups,as well.Now I’ll rebuild and take a look at the changes.In the Product menu,I’ll select Build Documentation to rebuild.The documentation built,but I see a diagnostic generated by DocC,And it looks like I mistyped a link here.Let’s let autocomplete take care of it,so I’m certain it’s correct.Now I’m going to rebuild the documentation againusing the Product menu to see if I resolved all of the issues.Awesome, no more warnings.On the framework page in the documentation window,our new "Getting Started" article is the first topiceveryone will see,followed by the main themes for SlothCreatorin order of complexity.The documentation navigator on the left also updatesto match each page’s topics section,so I can quickly find the page I’m looking for.Now let’s review how to organize your documentation.All of your pages are organized automatically,and you can customize with a topics section.To create a topics section,add a second-level topics heading.Then, add a group with a third-level heading,followed by a list of links to any other pagesthat you want to organize under the current page.You can add a topics section to any article,along with any container symbollike a class, structure, enumeration, or protocol.When you’re organizing documentationfor your framework,consider the most important features and themes,and which APIs developers might use together to create an app.Move supporting pages under your primary documentationto add focus and clarity.And start with the basicsand then introduce complexity progressively.Now that I’ve customized the groups on the framework page,I want to organize all of the documentation in SlothCreator,including types and their members.Documentation extensions give me the flexibilityto choose how I write documentation for my APIs.I could add a custom topics section right in my source code,but I think it would be easier to review and maintain over timeif this additional documentation was in a separate file.And I can use a documentation extension to do just that.First, I create a new Markdown file.I associate it with an API using link syntax in the title.Next, to improve the focus and clarity in my source code,I’ll leave the primary content --like the summary and discussion --in the code and extract the topics section.When DocC builds, it merges each source commentand corresponding documentation extensioninto a single documentation page.With extensions,it’s simple to write and review the documentation,improve the framework’s generated interface,and provide a betterdocumentation reading experience.Now, I’ll add a documentation extensionto enhance the documentation for SlothCreator.First, I’ll take a look at the Sloth pagebefore I make any changes.I have the documentation comment for the Sloth type,and I also have the built documentation.The documentation I wrote in the source code looks great,but the Topics section could be improved,and I can do that in a documentation extension.In the project navigator,I’ll right-click on the documentation catalogto add a new file.In the template chooser,I’ll select the Extension File template and name it "Sloth."Next, I’ll connect the extension file to the sloth typeusing a link in the title.I need to include the name of the module in the URL.This might look familiar,because earlier my colleague Bea used this syntaxto create the top-level framework article.Then I’ll add some customized groups in a topics section.Finally, I’ll rebuild using Product > Build Documentationto check out the result.The content I wrote in the source codeis still at the top,and the topics section I created in the documentation fileis added after it.When I expand the page in the navigator,the navigator's updated as well.The changes that Bea and I made are done,and we’re ready to share them with the world.The documentation looks great in Xcode,and anyone can build it after they download the Swift package.I can also use the Export button in the navigatorto export an archive that you can useto browse the documentation in Xcodewithout downloading or building the Swift package.And if I want to make it accessible to everyone,I can even publish the documentation on the web.And you can check out this related session to learn more.Now, let’s review how you can elevate the documentationfor your Swift framework.First, create articles to introduce your frameworkand explain how your APIs work together.Next,organize your documentation into groups to improve navigation.Finally, add depth and detail to your API referencein documentation extension files.If you want to go even further,you can learn how to publish to the weband guide readers step-by-step with tutorialsin these two related sessions.Xcode 13 is a huge update for documentation,and we’re so excited to see what you publish.Thanks for watching!♪

## Code Samples

```swift
# ``SlothCreator``


Catalog sloths you find in nature and create new adorable virtual sloths.


## Overview


SlothCreator provides models and utilities for creating, tracking, and caring for sloths. The framework provides structures to model an individual ``
Sloth
``, and identify them by key characteristics, including their ``
Sloth/name
`` and special supernatural ``
Sloth/power-swift.property
``. You can create your own custom sloths using a ``
SlothGenerator
``, and name them using a ``
NameGenerator
``.

Sloths need careful feeding and maintenance to ensure their health and happiness. You maintain their ``
Sloth/energyLevel
`` by providing the correct ``
Sloth/Food
`` and a suitable ``
Habitat
``. You can exercise your sloth by providing a fun or restful ``
Activity
``. 

You can visualize and observe your sloths by adding a ``
SlothView
`` to a SwiftUI view structure.
