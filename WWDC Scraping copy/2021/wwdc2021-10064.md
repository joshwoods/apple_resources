Search this video…♪ ♪Hi.I’m David Duncan, and with my colleague,Eric Dudiak, we’re going to be discussingall the ways that UIKitmakes buttons better in iOS 15.The humble button,a staple of apps large and small.Buttons are perhaps the most common wayto solicit user input.Buttons come in many forms: large and small;with images, text, or both; with and without backgrounds;and every color of the rainbow.Let’s start by focusing on a few specific styles.In iOS 15, UIKit now providesthese four basic styles.Adding to the plain style you already know and loveare the new gray, tinted, and filled styles.But UIKit doesn’t just make buttons more stylishin iOS 15.It also makes them more powerful.Dynamic type is now supported by default,and multiline text support is built into button system.Accessibility has been enhanced with better supportfor all accessibility features as well as generating buttonsthat are more accessible by default.And with all these new features, buttons are more customizablethan ever, so you can get exactly the style you want.So with that primer,let’s meet UIButtonConfiguration,the entry point to the new button system.Welcome to Button Emporium, the premier supplierof buttons of all shapes and sizes.Button Emporium always wants to have the best buttons,so let’s update the app to adopt UIButtonConfiguration...starting with the all-important Sign In button.Currently the app generates a Sign In button with this code,generating a plain system button with the title “Sign In”.But this is a super important button,so let’s make it stand out more using the new filled style.And we’re done!It’s easy to get started with UIButtonConfiguration,as UIButton automatically integrates titles and imagesset with the existing API on configurations you provide,making it easy to update your button’s stylewithout updating all your code at once.But when you’re ready to update your code, there is plenty moreto UIButtonConfiguration than just styles.Let’s take a look at that next.This is our current “Add to Cart” button.It’s a pretty basic button right now,but we’re going to take advantageof new features offered by UIButtonConfigurationto turbo charge the button-buying experience.To start, we’ll use the tinted styleas it complements our other buttons.We start by creating a tinted button configuration,set its title,matching how we previously configured our button.Next we create the buttonwith our filled out configuration.This is already quite an improvement,but let’s take it over the top.The next improvement we’ll makeis to add an image to the button,making it simple to determine what it does at a glance.Our designer really wants the imagein the trailing position, so alongside settingthe image property,we also set the imagePlacement property,putting the image exactly where we want it.But there are two more features we want to addto our new “Add to Cart” button.The first is to preview what happenswhen you order multiple items,which will use the subtitle featureof UIButtonConfiguration.The second is to switch from the outlined imageto its filled version when the button is pressed.For that, we need to update the image propertyat the appropriate time.In order to update the button correctlywhen either of these changes occur,we’ll add a configurationUpdateHandler.The configurationUpdateHandler is called when the buttonneeds an update, allowing you to make centralized changes.Usually you’ll change the button’s configuration,so it typically beginsby obtaining a starting configurationand ends with setting the changed configuration.Here we start with the button’s existing configuration,but you can just as easily create a new one and fill outall of its parameters instead.First let’s set the correct imagefor the button.When the button is pressed, isHighlighted returns true,and we set the filled version of our cart symbol.Otherwise, we use the outlined version.Since isHighlighted is a stateof UIButton, it automatically arrangesfor the configurationUpdateHandlerto be called when that value changes.Next, we update the subtitlewhen itemQuantityDescription changes.But itemQuantityDescription isn’t a property of UIButton.How do we arrange for the configurationUpdateHandlerto be called when the value changes?When the customer changes the number of buttonsto be purchased, the app updates itemQuantityDescription.To ensure that the Add to Cart buttonalso updates, our didSet handler callssetNeedsUpdateConfiguration, which in turnarranges for the configurationUpdateHandlerto be called and triggers an update of the button.At Button Emporium,we’ve never met a button we didn’t like,and with UIButtonConfiguration, there is plenty to like.Before we update our next button,let’s quickly cover some other features.Buttons can now show an activity indicator,making it easy to provide feedback that your app is busy.Just set showsActivityIndicator to truein your button configuration, and we’ll show the indicator,replacing the image if necessary.Adjusting aspects of the button’s layoutis straightforward, giving you more controlover how content is positioned in the button.Here you can see how contentInsetsreserve space on the edges of the button,and imagePadding and titlePadding allow usto increase the space between those elements.And while UIKit will layout these components automatically,you have control over how titles alignwith each other as well as how the button’s contentaligns inside the content region.Semantic stylings make it simple to create buttonswith cohesive styleswithout having to dig into details.Starting with a simple filled button,we configure the baseBackgroundColor,baseForegroundColor,cornerStyle, and buttonSizeto generate a customized button,and you automatically get thematic states,such as pressed and disabled without any extra effort.But even with lots of automation,it’s still easy to make detailed customizationsfor those times when you simply must have exactly what you need,like with our all-important “Check Out” button.To ensure that Button Emporium customerscan get their buttons with a minimum of fuss,the check out button is big and easy to find.To build it, we’ll start with the filled style,set its size to large,and fill out its image and title.When the button is tapped, we start processingthe cart and want to show an activity indicator.To enable this, we add a configurationUpdateHandlerto manage the showsActivityIndicator propertyof the configuration.Just as before, changes to the isCartBusy propertywill call setNeedsUpdateConfigurationon the check out button to ensure the activity indicatoris turned on and off as necessary.And while blue is nice, we want to make sureto leave an impression.So to ensure our precise coloris used for the background,let’s set the backgroundColorof UIButtonConfiguration’s UIBackgroundConfiguration.That’s way better.Now that we’ve discussed how UIButtonConfigurationcan make your buttons look better than ever,I’ll hand it over to Eric to talkabout other new things that buttons can do.Thanks, David.Now that we’ve checked out how buttons can havetheir appearance customized, let’s inspect how buttonscan have their functionality customized.Most buttons are just simple push buttons,but sometimes a button needs a bit of extra behavior.The first ones we’re going to examine is the toggle button.These buttons preserve the selected statefrom UIControl.They automatically toggle it on and offeach time the button is pressed.It also can be programmatically changedas necessary.In addition to built-in styles for the on and off states,we can take advantage of the UIButtonConfigurationto customize the presentation of these on and off states.The concept of toggle buttons on iOS is not new.You may have noticed some buttonslike the lyrics button in the Music app.It toggles the lyrics on and off in the player like this.Functionally, this works just like UISwitch,but it saves some space in the UIand it fits the design of the app much better.Toggle buttons also work off UIBarButtonItemslike this one in Calendar.In the top bar, the day details can be enabled and disabled.Pushing it toggles the display of the details.In this case, there is a new selected propertyon UIBarButtonItem that can be read or setfor the selected state.Now let’s update Button Emporium to adopt toggle buttons.Our app lets us browse for the kinds of buttonswe want to buy.But while browsing, I only want to perusewhat’s currently in stock.Here, we’ve added a toggle buttonto toggle between showing absolutely everythingand just what’s in stock and ready to ship.This is a great use of the toggle button.One advantage is that, since it’s a button,the label is part of it,making it very clear what is being toggled here.So let’s check out how we made that.Here, we have the basics of setting up a button.To make it a toggle button, we just setchangesSelectionAsPrimaryAction to true.Now it’s a toggle button.That’s it.We can also set the selected stateto match our internal model.Now, we might want something a little more complicatedthat just two states of on and off.For buttons that can have more options to switch between,we can use pop-up buttons.Pop-up buttons are a close relativeto pull-down buttons, which already exist in iOS.These present a menu when pressed.Pop-up buttons take that a step furtherand ensure that one and only one of the menu elementsis ever selected.They also show that current selectionas their title and image.Building a pop-up button is actually an extensionof building a pull-down button.For those, a menu is assigned to the button.To make the menu the default action,the showsMenuAsPrimaryAction property is set to true.Pop-up buttons take that one step furtherby just turning on thechangesSelectionAsPrimaryAction property.That’s all it takes.They work like UISegmentedControlbut can be useful when there are more choicesthan might fit on the segmented control.They can also be useful for cases where the choiceshave an inherent hierarchy.Some examples of this style of button exist today.For example, the Phone app uses a pop-up buttonto switch between SIMs for outgoing calls.And here the button presents a menu.Selecting secondary switches the line.As a result, the button is updatedto the new outgoing line.The label and image have been updatedto display the new selection.Similarly, we have some use for this in Button Emporium.When we’re browsing buttons,we have some that come in a variety of colors.The number of colors is a fixed setto choose from, but probably too bigfor a segmented control, but it’s also small enoughthat we really want to change it in-line.This is a great use of a pop-up buttonbecause we want the selection to be the title of the button.We can then present all the color choices.And on a new selection, our appcan just update for the color choice.Let’s investigate the code for that.Here we actually have the code to makea simple pull-down menu that we can just update.Just like the toggle button, we switchchangesSelectionAsPrimaryAction to true.And now it’s a pop-up button.If we want to have a particular colorbe the default selection instead of just the first colorin the list, we can preassign that oneto “on” when we set the menu.That will make it the default selection.We can check the selection by asking the button’s menufor the current selectedElements,which will always have exactly a single element.And if we need to set a new one in code, we can just changethe state on the element from the button’s menu property.Pop-up buttons can also be created in Interface Builder,but in this case we’re going to want to retrievethe colors dynamically from the serverinstead of using a fixed list, so we’re gonna do it in code.To learn more about using the new button systemand button types with Interface Builder,check out the “Build interfaces with style” video.One of the best parts of these new button typesis that they automatically work on Mac Catalyst.Mac users expect buttons to look and behave a certain way,including pull-downs, pop-ups, and toggle buttons.With these iOS buttons, they automaticallyget updated to their Mac versions.So here we have a selection of buttons from an iPad app,like we’ve been using throughout the presentation,which include the default borderless buttonsand some using the new configurationsas well as pop-up and pull-down buttons.And here they are with no manual changeson Mac Catalyst.Just the way a seasoned Mac user would expect.We get the standard bezeled buttons,including the Mac indicators for pull-down and pop-up buttons.In some cases, however, the extra customizationof the iPad buttons may be more appropriateeven for a Mac app.For that, button support changing the behavior stylefrom the default of automatic to iPad.This is useful for very prominent,custom buttons in an app, like the check out buttonwe made earlier.For more information about buildingand customizing Mac Catalyst apps,check out the “What’s new in Mac Catalyst” video.As you may have noticed in the pop-up button examples,much of the functionality is built on topof new and existing features of UIMenu.UIMenu pairs really well with UIButtonand UIBarButtonItem for lots of great interactions.We’ve explored how you can adjust the behavior of buttonsto create both pop-up buttons and pull-down buttons.On iOS and iPadOS, these behaviors are independentof the visual customizations, so you caneasily combine them with UIButtonConfigurationto create lots of different button styles.These buttons also benefit from improvementsin menus like the ability for menu itemsto have subtitles for greater clarity.On top of that, submenu navigationon iOS and iPadOS has also been improved,allowing the creation of hierarchies within a menu.And in some cases, you might want the submenuof a pull-down button to behaveas a single-selection menu itself.This can be useful if you have a “sort-by” menuwithin an action menu, for example.Some of the new menu improvementsmake this much easier to create.Here’s a custom pull-down bar button itemusing a submenu in our code.It has a couple of actionsand then a submenu for sorting results.Instead of manually turning on and off the menu itemswithin that submenu, we’re just gonna indicatethat this submenu is for single selectionwhen we create it.Now it gets the same automatic selection behaviorthat pop-up buttons get but just within the submenu.Only one selected element will be allowed,and the element selected will be updated when the user taps it.It can be updated or accessed in code in the exact same wayas we did earlier with the pop-up menu.And single-selection behavior works if the menuhas its own submenu.Only one element in the entire subtreethen can be selected at a time.And the selectedElements propertyincludes selection in submenus, making the accessjust as easy as if we didn’t have a submenu.So that’s how to make better buttons in your app.Add configurations to buttonsto get more control over the stylingto unlock much richer stylingwhile still staying consistent with the platform.Also explore ways to replace existing picker interfacesor controls with pop-up or toggle buttonsto get more streamlined interactions.With these changes, you will likely findUIButton subclasses that can be removed or simplified.And because the system can better understandyour buttons, you’ll get much betterMac Catalyst conversion automatically.Thank you for joining us,and I hope you’ve enjoyedthis deep dive into the world of buttons.[upbeat music]

Accessibility has been enhanced with better supportfor all accessibility features as well as generating buttonsthat are more accessible by default.And with all these new features, buttons are more customizablethan ever, so you can get exactly the style you want.So with that primer,let’s meet UIButtonConfiguration,the entry point to the new button system.

Welcome to Button Emporium, the premier supplierof buttons of all shapes and sizes.

Button Emporium always wants to have the best buttons,so let’s update the app to adopt UIButtonConfiguration...starting with the all-important Sign In button.

Currently the app generates a Sign In button with this code,generating a plain system button with the title “Sign In”.

But this is a super important button,so let’s make it stand out more using the new filled style.

And we’re done!It’s easy to get started with UIButtonConfiguration,as UIButton automatically integrates titles and imagesset with the existing API on configurations you provide,making it easy to update your button’s stylewithout updating all your code at once.But when you’re ready to update your code, there is plenty moreto UIButtonConfiguration than just styles.Let’s take a look at that next.

This is our current “Add to Cart” button.

It’s a pretty basic button right now,but we’re going to take advantageof new features offered by UIButtonConfigurationto turbo charge the button-buying experience.

To start, we’ll use the tinted styleas it complements our other buttons.We start by creating a tinted button configuration,set its title,matching how we previously configured our button.

Next we create the buttonwith our filled out configuration.

This is already quite an improvement,but let’s take it over the top.The next improvement we’ll makeis to add an image to the button,making it simple to determine what it does at a glance.

Our designer really wants the imagein the trailing position, so alongside settingthe image property,we also set the imagePlacement property,putting the image exactly where we want it.

But there are two more features we want to addto our new “Add to Cart” button.

The first is to preview what happenswhen you order multiple items,which will use the subtitle featureof UIButtonConfiguration.

The second is to switch from the outlined imageto its filled version when the button is pressed.

For that, we need to update the image propertyat the appropriate time.

In order to update the button correctlywhen either of these changes occur,we’ll add a configurationUpdateHandler.

The configurationUpdateHandler is called when the buttonneeds an update, allowing you to make centralized changes.

Usually you’ll change the button’s configuration,so it typically beginsby obtaining a starting configurationand ends with setting the changed configuration.

Here we start with the button’s existing configuration,but you can just as easily create a new one and fill outall of its parameters instead.

First let’s set the correct imagefor the button.When the button is pressed, isHighlighted returns true,and we set the filled version of our cart symbol.

Otherwise, we use the outlined version.

Since isHighlighted is a stateof UIButton, it automatically arrangesfor the configurationUpdateHandlerto be called when that value changes.

Next, we update the subtitlewhen itemQuantityDescription changes.But itemQuantityDescription isn’t a property of UIButton.How do we arrange for the configurationUpdateHandlerto be called when the value changes?When the customer changes the number of buttonsto be purchased, the app updates itemQuantityDescription.

To ensure that the Add to Cart buttonalso updates, our didSet handler callssetNeedsUpdateConfiguration, which in turnarranges for the configurationUpdateHandlerto be called and triggers an update of the button.

At Button Emporium,we’ve never met a button we didn’t like,and with UIButtonConfiguration, there is plenty to like.

Before we update our next button,let’s quickly cover some other features.

Buttons can now show an activity indicator,making it easy to provide feedback that your app is busy.

Just set showsActivityIndicator to truein your button configuration, and we’ll show the indicator,replacing the image if necessary.

Adjusting aspects of the button’s layoutis straightforward, giving you more controlover how content is positioned in the button.Here you can see how contentInsetsreserve space on the edges of the button,and imagePadding and titlePadding allow usto increase the space between those elements.

And while UIKit will layout these components automatically,you have control over how titles alignwith each other as well as how the button’s contentaligns inside the content region.

Semantic stylings make it simple to create buttonswith cohesive styleswithout having to dig into details.

Starting with a simple filled button,we configure the baseBackgroundColor,baseForegroundColor,cornerStyle, and buttonSizeto generate a customized button,and you automatically get thematic states,such as pressed and disabled without any extra effort.

But even with lots of automation,it’s still easy to make detailed customizationsfor those times when you simply must have exactly what you need,like with our all-important “Check Out” button.

To ensure that Button Emporium customerscan get their buttons with a minimum of fuss,the check out button is big and easy to find.

To build it, we’ll start with the filled style,set its size to large,and fill out its image and title.

When the button is tapped, we start processingthe cart and want to show an activity indicator.

To enable this, we add a configurationUpdateHandlerto manage the showsActivityIndicator propertyof the configuration.

Just as before, changes to the isCartBusy propertywill call setNeedsUpdateConfigurationon the check out button to ensure the activity indicatoris turned on and off as necessary.

And while blue is nice, we want to make sureto leave an impression.

So to ensure our precise coloris used for the background,let’s set the backgroundColorof UIButtonConfiguration’s UIBackgroundConfiguration.That’s way better.

Now that we’ve discussed how UIButtonConfigurationcan make your buttons look better than ever,I’ll hand it over to Eric to talkabout other new things that buttons can do.Thanks, David.Now that we’ve checked out how buttons can havetheir appearance customized, let’s inspect how buttonscan have their functionality customized.Most buttons are just simple push buttons,but sometimes a button needs a bit of extra behavior.The first ones we’re going to examine is the toggle button.

These buttons preserve the selected statefrom UIControl.They automatically toggle it on and offeach time the button is pressed.

It also can be programmatically changedas necessary.

In addition to built-in styles for the on and off states,we can take advantage of the UIButtonConfigurationto customize the presentation of these on and off states.

The concept of toggle buttons on iOS is not new.You may have noticed some buttonslike the lyrics button in the Music app.

It toggles the lyrics on and off in the player like this.

Functionally, this works just like UISwitch,but it saves some space in the UIand it fits the design of the app much better.

Toggle buttons also work off UIBarButtonItemslike this one in Calendar.

In the top bar, the day details can be enabled and disabled.

Pushing it toggles the display of the details.

In this case, there is a new selected propertyon UIBarButtonItem that can be read or setfor the selected state.Now let’s update Button Emporium to adopt toggle buttons.

Our app lets us browse for the kinds of buttonswe want to buy.But while browsing, I only want to perusewhat’s currently in stock.Here, we’ve added a toggle buttonto toggle between showing absolutely everythingand just what’s in stock and ready to ship.This is a great use of the toggle button.One advantage is that, since it’s a button,the label is part of it,making it very clear what is being toggled here.

So let’s check out how we made that.Here, we have the basics of setting up a button.To make it a toggle button, we just setchangesSelectionAsPrimaryAction to true.Now it’s a toggle button.That’s it.

We can also set the selected stateto match our internal model.

Now, we might want something a little more complicatedthat just two states of on and off.For buttons that can have more options to switch between,we can use pop-up buttons.Pop-up buttons are a close relativeto pull-down buttons, which already exist in iOS.These present a menu when pressed.Pop-up buttons take that a step furtherand ensure that one and only one of the menu elementsis ever selected.

They also show that current selectionas their title and image.Building a pop-up button is actually an extensionof building a pull-down button.For those, a menu is assigned to the button.To make the menu the default action,the showsMenuAsPrimaryAction property is set to true.

Some examples of this style of button exist today.For example, the Phone app uses a pop-up buttonto switch between SIMs for outgoing calls.

And here the button presents a menu.Selecting secondary switches the line.As a result, the button is updatedto the new outgoing line.The label and image have been updatedto display the new selection.

Similarly, we have some use for this in Button Emporium.When we’re browsing buttons,we have some that come in a variety of colors.The number of colors is a fixed setto choose from, but probably too bigfor a segmented control, but it’s also small enoughthat we really want to change it in-line.

This is a great use of a pop-up buttonbecause we want the selection to be the title of the button.We can then present all the color choices.

And on a new selection, our appcan just update for the color choice.

Let’s investigate the code for that.Here we actually have the code to makea simple pull-down menu that we can just update.

Just like the toggle button, we switchchangesSelectionAsPrimaryAction to true.And now it’s a pop-up button.

If we want to have a particular colorbe the default selection instead of just the first colorin the list, we can preassign that oneto “on” when we set the menu.

That will make it the default selection.

We can check the selection by asking the button’s menufor the current selectedElements,which will always have exactly a single element.

And if we need to set a new one in code, we can just changethe state on the element from the button’s menu property.

Pop-up buttons can also be created in Interface Builder,but in this case we’re going to want to retrievethe colors dynamically from the serverinstead of using a fixed list, so we’re gonna do it in code.To learn more about using the new button systemand button types with Interface Builder,check out the “Build interfaces with style” video.

One of the best parts of these new button typesis that they automatically work on Mac Catalyst.Mac users expect buttons to look and behave a certain way,including pull-downs, pop-ups, and toggle buttons.With these iOS buttons, they automaticallyget updated to their Mac versions.

So here we have a selection of buttons from an iPad app,like we’ve been using throughout the presentation,which include the default borderless buttonsand some using the new configurationsas well as pop-up and pull-down buttons.

And here they are with no manual changeson Mac Catalyst.Just the way a seasoned Mac user would expect.We get the standard bezeled buttons,including the Mac indicators for pull-down and pop-up buttons.

In some cases, however, the extra customizationof the iPad buttons may be more appropriateeven for a Mac app.For that, button support changing the behavior stylefrom the default of automatic to iPad.

This is useful for very prominent,custom buttons in an app, like the check out buttonwe made earlier.For more information about buildingand customizing Mac Catalyst apps,check out the “What’s new in Mac Catalyst” video.

As you may have noticed in the pop-up button examples,much of the functionality is built on topof new and existing features of UIMenu.

UIMenu pairs really well with UIButtonand UIBarButtonItem for lots of great interactions.We’ve explored how you can adjust the behavior of buttonsto create both pop-up buttons and pull-down buttons.On iOS and iPadOS, these behaviors are independentof the visual customizations, so you caneasily combine them with UIButtonConfigurationto create lots of different button styles.

These buttons also benefit from improvementsin menus like the ability for menu itemsto have subtitles for greater clarity.

On top of that, submenu navigationon iOS and iPadOS has also been improved,allowing the creation of hierarchies within a menu.And in some cases, you might want the submenuof a pull-down button to behaveas a single-selection menu itself.This can be useful if you have a “sort-by” menuwithin an action menu, for example.Some of the new menu improvementsmake this much easier to create.

Here’s a custom pull-down bar button itemusing a submenu in our code.

It has a couple of actionsand then a submenu for sorting results.Instead of manually turning on and off the menu itemswithin that submenu, we’re just gonna indicatethat this submenu is for single selectionwhen we create it.Now it gets the same automatic selection behaviorthat pop-up buttons get but just within the submenu.Only one selected element will be allowed,and the element selected will be updated when the user taps it.

It can be updated or accessed in code in the exact same wayas we did earlier with the pop-up menu.

And single-selection behavior works if the menuhas its own submenu.Only one element in the entire subtreethen can be selected at a time.And the selectedElements propertyincludes selection in submenus, making the accessjust as easy as if we didn’t have a submenu.

So that’s how to make better buttons in your app.Add configurations to buttonsto get more control over the stylingto unlock much richer stylingwhile still staying consistent with the platform.

Also explore ways to replace existing picker interfacesor controls with pop-up or toggle buttonsto get more streamlined interactions.

With these changes, you will likely findUIButton subclasses that can be removed or simplified.

And because the system can better understandyour buttons, you’ll get much betterMac Catalyst conversion automatically.Thank you for joining us,and I hope you’ve enjoyedthis deep dive into the world of buttons.[upbeat music]
