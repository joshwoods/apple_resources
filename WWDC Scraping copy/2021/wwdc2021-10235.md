Search this video…Hi, my name is Will,and I'm a design manager at Apple.Today, with my colleague Hannah,I'll show you how you can use DocCto write interactive developer tutorials.Tutorials are a great way to teach developers the detailsof how your swift framework or package works,with step-by-step instructionsto build real apps using your API.You may be familiar with some tutorialswe've written at Apple.We created tutorials to introduce youto SwiftUI and Mac Catalyst.In these introductory tutorials, you learn the basicsof those frameworks and build your skillsby following step-by-step code examples.We've found that framework adopters love how quicklythey can get started with new ideas presented in tutorials.To make writing these tutorials possible,we built a documentation compiler called DocC.DocC leverages markdownto convert plain text into a rich, interactive system,and this year, we've introduced DocC to Xcode,so you can write tutorials for your Swift packageor Swift framework, too.DocC isn't only for developer tutorials.DocC can also build documentationfor the Swift frameworks and packagesin your project from source comments,which means for app developers,your dependencies can have documentationright alongside platform librariesin the developer documentation window.And if you create Swift frameworks or Swift packages,you can write documentation for your adoptersright in your source, so it's easy to keep up-to-dateas you create and modify API.You write documentation comments with markdownto preserve readability in source, while providinga rich formatting experience for the documentation window.You can also write articles and organize all the APIin your framework or packageby adding a Documentation Catalog.You can learn more about using DocCand configuring Documentation Catalogsin the sessions listed here.In this session, I'll focus on writing tutorials.Tutorials are a highly-interactive formof documentation,and in order to make authoring them easy,we've extended markdown to have directives.Directives provide structure to author content-like tutorialsso you can focus on writing contentwith existing markdown syntaxyou might already be familiar with.Developer tutorials are centered around building real projects,ideally apps.Tutorial apps should use the API in your frameworkin a realistic way.For example, in the SwiftUI tutorials,we show you how to build an app called Landmarksthat explores the core features beginners need to understandto get started with SwiftUI.With Mac Catalyst, we teach you to build a Recipes appthat explores the differencesbetween iPad and Mac navigation idioms.And now, my colleagues and Ihave been working on a new frameworkfor creating, cataloging, and caringfor cute little digital sloths right on your iPhone.My colleagues have already writtensome great reference documentation and articles,but I think adopters of this framework will benefitfrom learning to build a real app so they can quickly seehow the different aspects of the framework interact.In this session, my colleague Hannah and Iwill build tutorials to teach adopters of this frameworkthe basics they need to get started with it.I'll start by giving you an overviewof the main components of tutorials.Then I'll explain how I approach ideation and planning.And finally, I'll hand it off to Hannah,who will demo creating a collection of tutorials.All right. Let's get started.As I mentioned earlier, tutorials area highly-interactive way to learn.And like article and reference documentation,the text of tutorials is authored in markdown,but tutorials use a special syntaxto wrap this markdown in a directivethat provides structureso DocC can build the complex layoutand interactions featured in the tutorial.This is a basic directive that tells DocCthis text is a single step of a tutorial.Along with the instructive text, this example includes a linkto a Swift file that DocC will display to show readersexactly what code to write to accomplish the step.And DocC directives can be nested.In this case, the code directive contains an image directivethat provides the reader more context for the step.Tutorial pages have lots of individual steps,like the one we just looked at.The table of contents provides organizationand links to the individual tutorials.Let's take a look at the directivesof a table of contents.The table of contents filestarts with a Tutorials directive,which contains all the elements of the page.Inside the Tutorials directive, there is an Intro directive,which includes a title and a brief descriptionof what the framework adopter will buildthroughout the tutorials.DocC generates some elements of the introduction,such as the "Get Started" buttonand timing calculation automaticallywhen you provide links to the tutorialsin the Table of Contents page.The introduction also contains an image directive.You can store imagesin your documentation catalog resources folder.Down the page, you'll find a Chapter directive.You use chapters to organize tutorialsinto groups that make sense together.Chapters give framework adopters a clear sense of progressas they follow your tutorials, as well as provide contextfor what a framework is all about.Inside the Chapter,there are individual links to tutorials.With all the context set by this page,framework adopters should have a good understandingfor what the framework is and what they'll build with itbefore navigating to a Tutorial page.Much like the table of contents, the Tutorial page startswith a single directivethat contains the contents of the page.In this case, it's a single Tutorial directive.DocC uses some information from the Table of Contents pagein the tutorial introduction, letting folks knowwhat the overall theme of this tutorial isby referencing the chapter it belongs to.The introduction to the tutorial includes a title and descriptionthat tell the framework adopterwhich part the framework they'll useand what they'll build with it.To provide clarity along the path of building,tutorials are broken up into sections.Section introductions are very similarto tutorial introductions,but are specific to progress the framework adopter will makebefore moving on to the next section.Sections contain steps,which instruct the adopter on what exactly they need to doto move on to the next step.Steps should be short, easy to understand,and easy to follow.Framework adopters rely on consistentand clear tutorial steps to help them get up-to-speedon the framework they're learning about quickly.It's easier to create a cohesive set of stepsthroughout a collection of tutorialsif you start with a clear plan.Let me show you how I make this planby outlining a collection of developer tutorialsfor our new Sloth framework.In order to understand how to outline a framework,it's best to think about how the framework worksand what the real-world uses are for it.Now, the framework my colleagues and I have been working onis all about sloths, and it provides quite a bitof cool functionality I'm excited to see people use.Here's a high-level viewof the main functionality in the framework.In order to outline my tutorials,I'm going to list the most important APIso I can get a good ideaof how to explain them through tutorials.You can see there's API like the Sloth type itself,as well as a Food Generator and PowerPicker.If I try to think about these all at once,it's going to be tricky to decidehow I should teach them in a clear order.So let me group them by general functional area.I know understanding the Sloth type is really importantfor the adopters of this framework,so I'll group everything related to creatingand editing the Sloth type.APIs used for generating sloths,giving them names, editing their powers:these are the core API used for creating sloths.And it turns out, the remaining API, like food generator,care schedule, and habitat, are all related, as well.These API about taking care of sloths.So, it looks like I have two main API groupingsthat make up the framework:the group of API that are about creating slothsand the group of API that are about caring for sloths.This is a great start.I know that adopters will need to understand these APIto successfully use our framework.And grouping them in this way will make it easy for meto show them how they function together.But I also know that adopters of this framework are likelyto want to do more complicated things in their own apps.So, I'll add another group.Our new framework is all about creating and caring for sloths,but I want to prepare folks to use it in waysthat go beyond the API it includes,so I should include some informationabout interoperability.I think adopters are likely to use the framework to help slothsinteract with other animals, move around different locations,or hang out in groups of sloths.I'm not trying to imagine every use case.I just want enough variety to introduce folksto ways they might use the framework in their own apps.With these three groups,I have a great start organizing my tutorials.For now, I'll turn these groups into chapters,and I'll use them to brainstorm app ideasto let me teach the adopters of my frameworkhow to use my API in a real app.For the tutorials, I've designed an appthat has features for each of these three areas.For creating, I'll make a simple viewthat lets users generate a new slothand assign it a color and power.For caring, I'll give users the ability to seethe sloth's general activity level, appetite, and mood.And for the interaction section,I'll make a feature that lets usersfind their sloths as they move around the worldand interact with other animals.With my app idea sketched out,I'm ready to plan how I'll build itand how I'll teach people to build it, too.I'll write a list of tutorials for each chapterthat roughly follows how I'd go about building the app.First, I'd make the view for creating sloths.Then I'd work onthe more complicated caring-for-sloths features.Finally, I'd build the parts of the appthat use other frameworks.After all this planning, I have a list of tutorialsthat I'm confident will help adopters of our frameworkcreate and care for sloths.This plan might change as I write, but for now,it'll help me organize my thoughtsand make sure I've covered all the important APIin a clear but not redundant way.So far, we've explored the directive syntaxand the components that make up tutorials.We've also walked through the basicsof outlining a collection of tutorials.At this point, we're ready to start writing,so I'll hand it off to my colleague Hannahwho will show you how to write tutorials with DocC in Xcode 13.Thanks, Will. My name is Hannah.I'm a Human Interface designer here at Apple.Now that I have an outline of the SlothCreator Tutorials,with the all-new DocC feature in Xcode 13,let's walk through how to write a tutorial together.My colleague, Bea and Jack, covered how to createa Documentation Catalog to organize documentation filesin the session "Elevate Your DocC Documentation in Xcode."I'm going to add my tutorialsin the same Documentation Catalogthey created for SlothCreator.As Will mentioned, we need a table of contents filein order to compile the tutorials.So I've already created a Tutorials folderand a Table of Contents filefor my SlothCreator Tutorials.Now, let's start creating my first tutorial!First, I'll right click on the Tutorials folder,select New File to bring up the template selector,then select Tutorial file, click Next.I'll name this tutorial "Creating Custom Sloths."DocC provides a template for me to start with.In the tutorial file template,there's an intro, a section,and a set of steps in the section.If I want, I can showthe estimated time of completion for my tutorial.I'll say it takes about 20 minutes.Let's continue with the title of this tutorial.Here, I'll put in"Creating Custom Sloths."Then add my overview of this tutorial.I want to make my tutorial look more engaging,so I prepared some art filesfor the tutorial intro, section intro, and steps.Let me open my Art File folder,select all the images I prepared,drag and drop them into the Resources folderin the Documentation Catalog.Let me show you the intro image I designed.It visually describes what our framework adoptersare going to build in this tutorial.To add the intro image,I'll put in the image file name after "source."I'm also going to addan accessible description for the image.I want my tutorials to be accessible to everyoneso that every SlothCreator adoptercan have a great learning experiencethrough both reading and listening to the tutorials.An accessible descriptiondescribes what's self-explanatoryto someone who's looking at the image.For example,I'll describe the intro image as"A wireframe of an app interfacethat has an outline of a slothand four buttons below the sloth.The buttons display the following symbols,from left to right:ice, fire,wind, and lightning."Let's add the description in the code.Now that I've completed the intro of this tutorial,let's move on to the first section.This is going to be a beginner-friendly tutorial.So in the first section,our framework adopters will start withsetting up the basics for the Slothy app.I'll put in the section titleand add a description of the section.I'm also going to add the section image I prepared,which visually representsthe task flow of this section.Similar to how I added the intro image,I'll put in the image file nameand an accessible description.Next, let's move on to steps.In the first step in this section,our framework adopters will createa new Xcode project using the iOS app template.I'll put that in the instruction.The media of this stepshould give adopters more contexton how to do it, so I took a screenshotof Xcode's template selectorand highlighted the areas they need to interact with.One thing to keep in mind,when our framework adopters are viewing this tutorial,the background for Sections and Stepscould be either light or darkbased on their Xcode settings.So I can either create an image that is dark-mode compatibleor provide a separate imagefor each appearance.I'll add this image to the step.Now I have added the first step,I'll go ahead and add the rest of the steps in section 1.Okay.I've completed the steps in the first section.Let's take a look how this tutorial is coming along.In Xcode 13, I can preview my tutorialsin the Developer Documentation window by navigatingto Product Build documentation,or use the shortcut by pressingcontrol+shift+command+D on the keyboard.Great! The tutorials compiled successfully.And now, I can preview what I wrotein the Documentation Window that just popped up.Let's take a look at the Table of Contents page.On the navigator on the left,I can see my tutorials are organizedunder the SlothCreator project,along with other documentationmy colleagues wrote for SlothCreator.On the right side, I can see the Table of Contents page.There is an overview for the tutorial collectionand an eye-catching image in the intro section.Below the intro, there's my first chapterand a link to the tutorial I just wrote.Let's take a look.From the top of the Tutorial page,there's the tutorial intro,which tells our framework adoptersthat they will build a SlothCreation view,and it'll take them about 20 minutes.Below that is the first section.In this section, adopters will go throughfour simple steps to set up their project.We can see the image updatesas we scroll down the steps.So far, everything looks good.In the second section, our framework adopterswill start coding with SlothCreator.Let's move on to see how to guide them with code steps.I've already completed the introof section 2 and the first step.Let's take a look at the second step,where our framework adopters are importingthe SlothCreator package in the Swift filethey created in the previous step.Before we dive into it,I want to point out a couple of things.A code step shows the display name on top,telling adopters which file they should be working on.DocC will display the Swift fileI'm adding for this stepon the right side of the screen, below the display name.DocC can also automatically comparethe current code file with the one from previous stepand highlight the new portion of the code.This code file generates a preview.I can add a screenshot of the preview to this stepso that adopters can checkif they have followed the instruction successfully.Let's go back to Xcode and finish this step.First, add the display name,then the code file name,and lastly, the preview image.Now we've gone over how to add a code step,I'll go ahead and add the rest of the stepsin section 2.So far, we've walked through how to write a tutorial intro,a section, and different types of steps.Now, I'm going to add all the tutorialsI've written for SlothCreator.Let me open Finder,select all the tutorial files I prepared,drag and drop theminto the Tutorials folder.Next, I'll open the Table of Contents file,link the other two tutorialsin the first chapter,then add the second and the third chapter.Okay, now I have completed SlothCreator Tutorials.Let's take a look together.From the Table of Contents page,we can see this tutorial collection includeseight tutorials organizedinto three chapters.I can also see this structurefrom the navigator on the left.This page is a great way to provide our framework adoptersa summarized view of this tutorial collection.Let's also take a look at the Tutorial page I just wrote.We have seen the intro and the first section,which guides our framework adoptersthrough how to set up their project.Below that is the second sectionthat provides adopters clear coding instructionson how to build a sloth customization view.Awesome!The tutorials look really good!I'm sure our framework adopters will be excitedto learn about SlothCreator when they see my tutorials.In this session, we went over what tutorials are,what makes a good tutorial,how to outline tutorials, and how to use DocCto write and preview tutorials.DocC is a powerful newdocumentation feature in Xcode 13.With it, you can writecomprehensive documentation for your framework,including reference, articles, and tutorials.To learn more about how to write, build,and organize your documentation with DocC,I recommend you check out other DocC sessionsfrom WWDC this year.Thank you for learning with us,and we are thrilled to seewhat you are going to create with DocC in Xcode 13.[upbeat music]

And if you create Swift frameworks or Swift packages,you can write documentation for your adoptersright in your source, so it's easy to keep up-to-dateas you create and modify API.You write documentation comments with markdownto preserve readability in source, while providinga rich formatting experience for the documentation window.You can also write articles and organize all the APIin your framework or packageby adding a Documentation Catalog.

You can learn more about using DocCand configuring Documentation Catalogsin the sessions listed here.

In this session, I'll focus on writing tutorials.

Tutorials are a highly-interactive formof documentation,and in order to make authoring them easy,we've extended markdown to have directives.Directives provide structure to author content-like tutorialsso you can focus on writing contentwith existing markdown syntaxyou might already be familiar with.

Developer tutorials are centered around building real projects,ideally apps.Tutorial apps should use the API in your frameworkin a realistic way.

For example, in the SwiftUI tutorials,we show you how to build an app called Landmarksthat explores the core features beginners need to understandto get started with SwiftUI.

With Mac Catalyst, we teach you to build a Recipes appthat explores the differencesbetween iPad and Mac navigation idioms.

And now, my colleagues and Ihave been working on a new frameworkfor creating, cataloging, and caringfor cute little digital sloths right on your iPhone.

Now, let's start creating my first tutorial!First, I'll right click on the Tutorials folder,select New File to bring up the template selector,then select Tutorial file, click Next.

I'll name this tutorial "Creating Custom Sloths."DocC provides a template for me to start with.In the tutorial file template,there's an intro, a section,and a set of steps in the section.

If I want, I can showthe estimated time of completion for my tutorial.I'll say it takes about 20 minutes.

Let's continue with the title of this tutorial.Here, I'll put in"Creating Custom Sloths."Then add my overview of this tutorial.

I want to make my tutorial look more engaging,so I prepared some art filesfor the tutorial intro, section intro, and steps.Let me open my Art File folder,select all the images I prepared,drag and drop them into the Resources folderin the Documentation Catalog.

Let me show you the intro image I designed.It visually describes what our framework adoptersare going to build in this tutorial.

To add the intro image,I'll put in the image file name after "source."I'm also going to addan accessible description for the image.

I want my tutorials to be accessible to everyoneso that every SlothCreator adoptercan have a great learning experiencethrough both reading and listening to the tutorials.

An accessible descriptiondescribes what's self-explanatoryto someone who's looking at the image.For example,I'll describe the intro image as"A wireframe of an app interfacethat has an outline of a slothand four buttons below the sloth.The buttons display the following symbols,from left to right:ice, fire,wind, and lightning."Let's add the description in the code.

Now that I've completed the intro of this tutorial,let's move on to the first section.

This is going to be a beginner-friendly tutorial.So in the first section,our framework adopters will start withsetting up the basics for the Slothy app.I'll put in the section titleand add a description of the section.

I'm also going to add the section image I prepared,which visually representsthe task flow of this section.

Similar to how I added the intro image,I'll put in the image file nameand an accessible description.

Next, let's move on to steps.

In the first step in this section,our framework adopters will createa new Xcode project using the iOS app template.I'll put that in the instruction.

The media of this stepshould give adopters more contexton how to do it, so I took a screenshotof Xcode's template selectorand highlighted the areas they need to interact with.

One thing to keep in mind,when our framework adopters are viewing this tutorial,the background for Sections and Stepscould be either light or darkbased on their Xcode settings.So I can either create an image that is dark-mode compatibleor provide a separate imagefor each appearance.

I'll add this image to the step.

Now I have added the first step,I'll go ahead and add the rest of the steps in section 1.

Okay.I've completed the steps in the first section.Let's take a look how this tutorial is coming along.In Xcode 13, I can preview my tutorialsin the Developer Documentation window by navigatingto Product Build documentation,or use the shortcut by pressingcontrol+shift+command+D on the keyboard.

Great! The tutorials compiled successfully.And now, I can preview what I wrotein the Documentation Window that just popped up.Let's take a look at the Table of Contents page.On the navigator on the left,I can see my tutorials are organizedunder the SlothCreator project,along with other documentationmy colleagues wrote for SlothCreator.On the right side, I can see the Table of Contents page.There is an overview for the tutorial collectionand an eye-catching image in the intro section.

Below the intro, there's my first chapterand a link to the tutorial I just wrote.Let's take a look.

From the top of the Tutorial page,there's the tutorial intro,which tells our framework adoptersthat they will build a SlothCreation view,and it'll take them about 20 minutes.

Below that is the first section.

In this section, adopters will go throughfour simple steps to set up their project.

We can see the image updatesas we scroll down the steps.So far, everything looks good.In the second section, our framework adopterswill start coding with SlothCreator.Let's move on to see how to guide them with code steps.

I've already completed the introof section 2 and the first step.Let's take a look at the second step,where our framework adopters are importingthe SlothCreator package in the Swift filethey created in the previous step.Before we dive into it,I want to point out a couple of things.A code step shows the display name on top,telling adopters which file they should be working on.

DocC will display the Swift fileI'm adding for this stepon the right side of the screen, below the display name.

DocC can also automatically comparethe current code file with the one from previous stepand highlight the new portion of the code.

This code file generates a preview.I can add a screenshot of the preview to this stepso that adopters can checkif they have followed the instruction successfully.

Let's go back to Xcode and finish this step.First, add the display name,then the code file name,and lastly, the preview image.

Now we've gone over how to add a code step,I'll go ahead and add the rest of the stepsin section 2.

So far, we've walked through how to write a tutorial intro,a section, and different types of steps.Now, I'm going to add all the tutorialsI've written for SlothCreator.

Let me open Finder,select all the tutorial files I prepared,drag and drop theminto the Tutorials folder.

Next, I'll open the Table of Contents file,link the other two tutorialsin the first chapter,then add the second and the third chapter.

Okay, now I have completed SlothCreator Tutorials.Let's take a look together.From the Table of Contents page,we can see this tutorial collection includeseight tutorials organizedinto three chapters.

I can also see this structurefrom the navigator on the left.

This page is a great way to provide our framework adoptersa summarized view of this tutorial collection.Let's also take a look at the Tutorial page I just wrote.We have seen the intro and the first section,which guides our framework adoptersthrough how to set up their project.

Below that is the second sectionthat provides adopters clear coding instructionson how to build a sloth customization view.

Awesome!The tutorials look really good!I'm sure our framework adopters will be excitedto learn about SlothCreator when they see my tutorials.

In this session, we went over what tutorials are,what makes a good tutorial,how to outline tutorials, and how to use DocCto write and preview tutorials.

DocC is a powerful newdocumentation feature in Xcode 13.With it, you can writecomprehensive documentation for your framework,including reference, articles, and tutorials.

To learn more about how to write, build,and organize your documentation with DocC,I recommend you check out other DocC sessionsfrom WWDC this year.

Thank you for learning with us,and we are thrilled to seewhat you are going to create with DocC in Xcode 13.[upbeat music]
