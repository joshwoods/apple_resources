What‘s new in Swift

Search this video…Hi, I'm Victoria.I'm an engineer on the Documentation Tools teamhere at Apple,and together with my colleague Ethan,we're going to give you an introductionto the new documentation features in Xcode 13.There are new ways to read and write documentationthat both fit right into your workflowand unlock new possibilities for your development.Xcode 13 has new features to build, write,and browse documentation for Swift frameworksand packages.This unlocks a powerful modeof documentation-driven developmentwhere you can read all about your Swift dependencieswhile you write your code.This documentation lives right alongside the platform librariesin the Developer Documentation window right in Xcode.In this session, we'll give an overviewof the documentation features in Xcode 13,walk you through building documentationfor the Swift frameworks and packagesyou're writing and using,show you how you can use Xcode 13to write great documentation,and finish up by showing off the waysyou can share documentation with Xcode 13.Let's get started with why I'm personally excitedabout the new documentation features.I'm sure we've all been there.There's some new framework or package that we want to use,but when it comes time to integrate it into our code,we need to figure out what all comes in it.This is where Xcode 13 steps in.Now Xcode comes with a compiler for your documentationas well as your code,and you can build and view documentationfor Swift frameworks and packages all inside Xcode.We call it DocC,and we've integrated it all throughout Xcodeto enhance the way you read and write documentation.Now, DocC is more than just a documentation compilerrun after the fact.It's a fully integrated documentation environmentthat complements Xcode, offering a rich,live environment with your docs appearing in Quick Help,rich code completionto allow you to tie your docs togetherinto a cohesive whole,full documentation availablein the integrated Developer Documentation window,and an easy option to share pre-built documentationto view in Xcode and on the web, just to name a few.Stay tuned for our other DocC sessions at WWDC 2021,which will go over all these in detail and much more.DocC empowers you to writeexcellent reference documentation,leveraging the power of Xcode and Swiftto give users a bird's-eye view of the public APIsin your framework or package,complete with the ability to describe how APIs work together,not just in isolation.DocC enables you to writemuch more than great reference documentation, though.There are two additional ways to write documentationwith DocC that we're excited to show off this year.Articles allow you to walk users through the big picturebehind your framework, giving you an opportunityto tie individual items in your framework togetherwith a cohesive story.And tutorials are a powerful step-by-step walk-throughof writing a project that uses your framework.They allow you to go much deeperthan reference documentation or articlesby giving your users a guided introductionto your framework from the ground up.All of these authoring experiences leverage and extendthe power and simplicity of Markdownto make authoring your documentationas fluid as writing your code.If you want to know more about assemblinga documentation catalogwith articles and tutorials outside your source code,check out these sessions at WWDC this year.And finally, we're releasing DocC as Open Sourcelater this year, alongside a web appthat allows you to hostyour built documentation archives on the webso you can take advantageof these new documentation workflowseven outside of Xcode.Now that you have a tasteof the new documentation features in Xcode 13,let's dive in and talk about building your documentationwith DocC in Xcode.Let's take a quick peek under the hood firstto see how it works.To build your documentation,Xcode builds your framework or packageand asks the compiler to save informationabout its public APIs alongside your compiled artifacts.That public API information is then handed to DocC,which then combines it with your documentation catalogcontaining articles and tutorialswritten outside your source code to create the final archivecontaining the compiled documentation.To learn more about documentation catalogsand organizing your docs,check out the “Elevate your DocC Documentationin Xcode” session.And thanks to DocC's integration with Xcode's build system,this process repeats for every Swift frameworkand package that your target depends on.This way, you have all your relevantdocumentation all in one place.But what does this mean for your day-to-day documentation needs?There are three ways to build documentationfor Swift frameworks and packages in Xcode 13.To build documentation on demand,there's a new Build Documentation menu itemto compile and load up your docs.And if you're working on a Swift frameworkand always want to preview your documentationas you go, there's also a new build settingto build docs every time you compile.And for your command-line and CI needs,xcodebuild has a new command to build documentation too.This runs the same build as selecting Build Documentationin Xcode but using xcodebuild on the command line.My colleague David has much more informationabout automating documentation workflows in the “Hostand Automate your DocC Documentation” session.Let's see this in action.My teammates have been working on this packagecalled SlothCreator, which is all aboutcataloging and customizing cute little sloths.I want to try it out, so let's see how that looks in Xcode 13.I've set up this app I've called Slothy so I can use SlothCreatorto customize my sloths and preview them as I go.I've set up SlothCreator as a dependency of my app already,but I want to see more about what APIs it offers,so let's open up the Product menu...And select Build Documentation to take a look.And just like that,the Developer Documentation window opens,and over in the Navigator,I can expand my Slothy project and the SlothCreator packageI'm working with to see an overview in the Navigator.I'll load the SlothCreator overview in the main view,and if I scroll down,there's a list of types and protocols available.Here I can see this type called Habitat.Let's click on it to load its page.There's some good information here,but I wonder if anything else has mentioned it.Let's select the Search field up top and look for "habitat".It looks like a few different things mention this.Let's click on this sleep methodto bring up its documentation page.This page is specific to the sleep method,but I'm curious what type this is part of.Up in the jump bar at the top of the window,I can see this is part of the Sloth type.If I click this Sloth, a pull-down menu appears,and if I click it again,I can open that type's documentation page.Now I'm getting a picture of how all these APIs fit together.So now we've had a chanceto walk through the documentation of SlothCreator.Let's rewind and take a look to see how it got to that point.My colleague Ethan will start off by showingsome of the new features in Xcode 13to write great documentation.Take it away.Thank you, Victoria.Now that we've gone over Xcode 13's great supportfor building and browsing documentation,I'd like to show you a few tricksto write even better documentation with DocC.DocC is designed aroundthe benefits of in-source documentation.You write your documentation right alongside your code,making it convenient and easy to integratewith your existing development workflow.To add documentation to a declaration,you just write a special kind of comment directly above it.This makes it easy to keep your documentation in syncwith any code changes you might make in the future.And, of course, it will fit right inwith your existing text-based tooling, like Git diffs.You're likely already annotating your source codewith comments to provide extra contextto future maintainers of your codebase.In Swift and many other languages, you write a commentby starting your line with two forward slashes.By writing these comments, you've gone a long wayin helping future maintainers to understandand be productive within your codebase.But what if you want to helptoday's adopters of your framework?This is what documentation comments are for.By writing a commentthat begins with three forward slashes,you're telling the Swift documentation compilerto associate the comment with the declarationimmediately below it.The comment will be included in the symbol'scompiled documentation pageand accessible to anyone who imports your framework.And if you prefer to use block-style comments,you can create a documentation comment in that styleby just including an extra asteriskin the opening delimiter.Let's see how this all works in practice.As Victoria mentioned, over the last few months,we've been working on the SlothCreator framework.SlothCreator is a Swift package that providesfunctionality for cataloging and customizing cute sloths.As a developer of SlothCreator, I want to be surethat there's an easy way for any adopters of the frameworkto get started, so I've been working onadding documentation commentsto the parts of the codebase I worked on.In particular, I want to be sure that everypublic API in SlothCreator is well documented,because it's these API that are accessibleto anyone importing my framework.For the same reason,DocC only generates documentation pagesfor the publicand open symbols in your framework.There's just a couple of symbols in SlothCreatorthat still need documenting.Let's start with this Food struct.I'll begin by adding three forward slashesabove the type's declarationto create a documentation comment.And then I'll write that this is "Food that a sloth can consume."The first line of my documentation commentwill turn into the symbol's summary,but I'd like to add some extra informationwith a discussion section.I'll add one now by adding a line breakafter my summary and then adding some additional detailabout the kinds of foods sloths love.And because DocC has full support for Markdown,I can add a code exampleusing Markdown's fenced code block syntax.Great.I think this adds some really helpful additional contextaround the Food struct.Let's see how my documentation is looking nowby rebuilding documentation.I can do that by moving my mouse up to the Product menuand then selecting Build Documentation.Xcode will now rebuild SlothCreator's documentationalongside the framework itself.And because I usedthe Build Documentation button for this build,when it's complete, the documentation viewerwill open with my updated documentation.But I'm actually interested in going straight to the pagefor the Food struct to review the comment we just added.Fortunately, Xcode has a feature called Quick Helpthat will let me do just that.Quick Help offers a short summarized versionof a symbol's documentation right in the source editor.I can try it out now by holding down the Option keyand then clicking on Food's declaration.But an adopter of SlothCreator could open the same viewby option-clicking on any reference to the Food structin their code.So the comment we wrote is right herein the Summary and Discussion sections.But if I'm looking for more than the summarized view,new in Xcode 13 is the Open in Developer Documentation link.If I move my mouseto the bottom right-hand corner of the Quick Help viewand click on Open in Developer Documentation,the documentation window will launchright to that symbol's page.Awesome.There's one other symbolthat's still missing documentation in SlothCreator.I'll open the Sloth file by moving my mouseover to Xcode's Navigator and clicking on the Sloth item.And if I scroll down, I'm noticing that the Eat methodstill needs a documentation comment.So let's take a quick lookat the best way of documenting methods.We start the same way,by adding a triple-slash commentabove the method's declaration and adding textthat will make up its documentation summary.But we should also document specificallywhat we're expecting to be passed as a parameter.We do this via a Parameters section.You add a Parameters section to your documentationby writing a Markdown list itemstarting with the word Parameterfollowed by the name of your method's parameter,a colon, and then its documentation.You can add a Returns section in a very similar way,this time by writing a Returns delimiter followed by a colonand a description of what your method returns.But what if your method has multiple parameters?In this case, the best thing to do is to go froma singular Parameter delimiter to a plural Parameters one.This works much the same as the othersexcept your parameter names are writtenas children of the parent Parameters delimiter.So now that we've gone over the basics,let's document the sloth Eat method.Now, I could begin the same way we didwhen documenting the Food structby manually writing a documentation commentbeginning with three forward slashes.But since I'm documenting a more complicated symbol,I'm going to take advantage of Xcode's greatAdd Documentation feature which will insert a templatebest-suited for documenting the current declaration.I can do this by holding down the Command keyand then clicking on the method's declarationto open the Action menu.Next, I can click on Add Documentationin the Action menu and, just like that,I have a great template to get started documenting my method.I'll begin by filling out the method's summary,and then I'll describe the food and quantity parametersas well as what this method returns.And then I'll finish off the documentation by addinga Discussion section along with a code example.Just like last time, I can rebuild documentationby moving my mouse to the Product menuand selecting the Build Documentation item.And once again, Xcode is building my documentationalongside the framework itself.This time, I'll navigate to the Sloth structvia the window's Navigator,where I'll find Sloth in the Sloths topic group.If I scroll down on the Sloth page,I'll find my method in the Instance Methods section...Along with my updated documentation.I'm already really happy with it.The inputs and outputs of the methodare really well defined,and there's a helpful code example here as well.I think this is nearly ready to go,but we're still missing something here.If I'm just reading this page of documentation,I don't have a great context of the otherrelevant symbols I should be considering here.And as a maintainer of SlothCreator,I'd really like to call out some other symbolsthat my reader should consider learning about next.Well, new to Xcode 13is the ability to link to symbols in your documentation.This is a really great way to connectdifferent parts of your frameworkand guide your reader to relevant pieces of information.You write these links via a new double backtick syntax.Let's look at an example.Here's the method we previously documented, sleep.But it doesn't exist in a vacuum.There's actually another property in the Sloth struct.There's a value representingthe current energy level of the sloth,and I think it's important herefor my reader to understandthat one of the side effectsof calling sleep is a change to the sloth's energy level.So I'll add to my methods Discussion section herewith a reference to the energyLevel property.Before Xcode 13, the natural way to do thiswould be to just write the property's namein a monospace code font by surrounding it in backticks.But now I can transform to double backtick syntaxand create a link.Now, linking to energyLevel was pretty simple becausethat property is a sibling of the method I'm documenting,and just like when referencing a local variable in Swift,I don't need to further qualify my link with the parent type.I can just write the name of the property, energyLevel.But if I want to reference a child of a different type,I need to be a little more specific.So here I write Habitat/comfortLevelto link to a child of the Habitat struct.Great.Let's see how this works in practice by adding some linksto the documentation for the eat method.I'll begin here by writing that"When they eat food, a sloth's..."and now I'm going to write a symbol linkto the energyLevel property.So I'll type two backticks,and then I'll begin writing energyLevel.Xcode's code completion will help me outto make sure I'm getting the correct link.I'll go ahead and select that item.And so I'll say that the energy level"increases by the food's"-- and now I'm going toreference a child of the Food struct.I'll begin with two backticks again.And then I'll write Food, a forward slash,and then energy.I've now created two symbol links which I thinkare going to really help my reader understandthe context around this method better.And these links are even accessible in Quick Help.So I'll hold down the Option keyand click on my method's declarationto open the Quick Help popover.Here's the Discussion section we addedand, of course, in the discussion, our two links.And if I click on one, I'm brought straight tothe referenced symbol's page in the documentation window.Now that I've written a good documentation commentfor every public API in SlothCreator,I'm really excited to share it with my colleaguesand maybe even make it available on the web.I can do this via the documentation archivethat Xcode outputs as part of every documentation build.Contained in the documentation archive is a single-page web appthat you can use to share your documentation on the web.My colleague David will be going in depth on just how to do thatin his “Host and automate your DocC documentation” session.I highly recommend you check that one out.But Xcode also supports exporting and importingyour documentation directly from the documentation window.Let's take a look at that now.I'll export SlothCreator from the documentation windowby first moving my mouse over to the window's Navigator.When I hover over the SlothCreator framework item,a contextual menu icon will appear.I'll click on it, and now I have the option to Export.I'll just save it to my desktop.Great.Now I'm ready to send it off to my colleagues,and if they just double-click on the archive,it will open in Xcode's documentation window.But since I already know about SlothCreator,I'd like to open up a different documentation archive.I've recently been discussing with the teamthat it would be greatto add a command line interface to SlothCreator,and one of my colleagues mentioned that ArgumentParseris a great open source framework that could help.They sent me the latest documentation archivefor ArgumentParser, so let's open it up now.I can just double-click on the documentation archiveand, just like that, get started learning right away.Documentation is key to developing a successfuland long-lasting framework.We think that you'll find writing documentationdirectly in source is really convenient and powerful.And new in Xcode 13 with DocC integration,all your hard work writing great documentationis going to pay off in new and powerful ways.We have several other sessions at WWDCthat really help you take your documentation to the next level.“Elevate your DocC documentation in Xcode”picks up where this session leaves off,showing you how to better organize your documentationby adding a documentation catalog.“Host and automate your DocC documentation,”which I mentioned earlier,explains how to integrate documentation buildsinto your existing continuous integration setupas well as how to host your documentation online.Finally, if you havea more complicated part of your frameworkthat could benefit from step-by-step instruction,I recommend you check out“Build interactive tutorials in DocC”which will show you how to do just that.Thank you for watching.[percussive music]

If I move my mouseto the bottom right-hand corner of the Quick Help viewand click on Open in Developer Documentation,the documentation window will launchright to that symbol's page.Awesome.There's one other symbolthat's still missing documentation in SlothCreator.I'll open the Sloth file by moving my mouseover to Xcode's Navigator and clicking on the Sloth item.And if I scroll down, I'm noticing that the Eat methodstill needs a documentation comment.So let's take a quick lookat the best way of documenting methods.

And once again, Xcode is building my documentationalongside the framework itself.This time, I'll navigate to the Sloth structvia the window's Navigator,where I'll find Sloth in the Sloths topic group.If I scroll down on the Sloth page,I'll find my method in the Instance Methods section...

Along with my updated documentation.I'm already really happy with it.The inputs and outputs of the methodare really well defined,and there's a helpful code example here as well.I think this is nearly ready to go,but we're still missing something here.If I'm just reading this page of documentation,I don't have a great context of the otherrelevant symbols I should be considering here.And as a maintainer of SlothCreator,I'd really like to call out some other symbolsthat my reader should consider learning about next.Well, new to Xcode 13is the ability to link to symbols in your documentation.This is a really great way to connectdifferent parts of your frameworkand guide your reader to relevant pieces of information.You write these links via a new double backtick syntax.Let's look at an example.

There's a value representingthe current energy level of the sloth,and I think it's important herefor my reader to understandthat one of the side effectsof calling sleep is a change to the sloth's energy level.

So I'll add to my methods Discussion section herewith a reference to the energyLevel property.

Before Xcode 13, the natural way to do thiswould be to just write the property's namein a monospace code font by surrounding it in backticks.But now I can transform to double backtick syntaxand create a link.Now, linking to energyLevel was pretty simple becausethat property is a sibling of the method I'm documenting,and just like when referencing a local variable in Swift,I don't need to further qualify my link with the parent type.I can just write the name of the property, energyLevel.

But if I want to reference a child of a different type,I need to be a little more specific.So here I write Habitat/comfortLevelto link to a child of the Habitat struct.Great.Let's see how this works in practice by adding some linksto the documentation for the eat method.I'll begin here by writing that"When they eat food, a sloth's..."and now I'm going to write a symbol linkto the energyLevel property.So I'll type two backticks,and then I'll begin writing energyLevel.Xcode's code completion will help me outto make sure I'm getting the correct link.I'll go ahead and select that item.

And so I'll say that the energy level"increases by the food's"-- and now I'm going toreference a child of the Food struct.I'll begin with two backticks again.And then I'll write Food, a forward slash,and then energy.

I've now created two symbol links which I thinkare going to really help my reader understandthe context around this method better.And these links are even accessible in Quick Help.So I'll hold down the Option keyand click on my method's declarationto open the Quick Help popover.Here's the Discussion section we addedand, of course, in the discussion, our two links.And if I click on one, I'm brought straight tothe referenced symbol's page in the documentation window.Now that I've written a good documentation commentfor every public API in SlothCreator,I'm really excited to share it with my colleaguesand maybe even make it available on the web.I can do this via the documentation archivethat Xcode outputs as part of every documentation build.Contained in the documentation archive is a single-page web appthat you can use to share your documentation on the web.My colleague David will be going in depth on just how to do thatin his “Host and automate your DocC documentation” session.I highly recommend you check that one out.

But Xcode also supports exporting and importingyour documentation directly from the documentation window.Let's take a look at that now.I'll export SlothCreator from the documentation windowby first moving my mouse over to the window's Navigator.When I hover over the SlothCreator framework item,a contextual menu icon will appear.I'll click on it, and now I have the option to Export.

I'll just save it to my desktop.Great.Now I'm ready to send it off to my colleagues,and if they just double-click on the archive,it will open in Xcode's documentation window.But since I already know about SlothCreator,I'd like to open up a different documentation archive.I've recently been discussing with the teamthat it would be greatto add a command line interface to SlothCreator,and one of my colleagues mentioned that ArgumentParseris a great open source framework that could help.They sent me the latest documentation archivefor ArgumentParser, so let's open it up now.I can just double-click on the documentation archiveand, just like that, get started learning right away.Documentation is key to developing a successfuland long-lasting framework.We think that you'll find writing documentationdirectly in source is really convenient and powerful.And new in Xcode 13 with DocC integration,all your hard work writing great documentationis going to pay off in new and powerful ways.

We have several other sessions at WWDCthat really help you take your documentation to the next level.“Elevate your DocC documentation in Xcode”picks up where this session leaves off,showing you how to better organize your documentationby adding a documentation catalog.“Host and automate your DocC documentation,”which I mentioned earlier,explains how to integrate documentation buildsinto your existing continuous integration setupas well as how to host your documentation online.

Finally, if you havea more complicated part of your frameworkthat could benefit from step-by-step instruction,I recommend you check out“Build interactive tutorials in DocC”which will show you how to do just that.
