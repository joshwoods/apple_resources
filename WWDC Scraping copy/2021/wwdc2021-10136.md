What’s New in Managing Apple Devices

Search this video…Hi, I'm Timm Hannon,an engineering manager in Core OS here at Apple.In this session, my colleague Melissa Nierle and Iwill cover User Enrollments for MDM.User Enrollment is designed for BYOD,or Bring Your Own Device deploymentswhere the user, not the organization,owns the device.Because the user owns the device,User Enrollment has a limited setof payloads and restrictionsthat can be applied to the deviceby the Mobile Device Management solution.And it's available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.Security and privacy are at the heartof everything we do here at Apple.User Enrollment is a great device management optionthat incorporates both.Its design allows the user to be comfortablethat their privacy and personal data are protected,while the organization can be confident their data is secure.There are three core componentsthat form the basis of User Enrollment.The first is a Managed Apple ID.Managed Apple IDs provide accessto Apple Services such as iCloud.They are owned and managed by an organizationand are available through Apple Business Managerand Apple School Manager.They support federation with Azure Active Directoryso that users can authenticatewith their organization's existing credentials.The second is Data Separation.During enrollment, a separate APFS volumewith different cryptographic keys is created.Data from managed apps and managed accountsis kept securely on this volumeaway from personal content.When the device unenrolls from management,the volume and the cryptographic keys are erased.And finally, the Management Capabilitiesare limited to those that are appropriatefor controlling the organization's contenton the device.The user owns and has been using the device,so it's critical to protect their privacy.With User Enrollments, the user maintains controlof their personal data on the device.The device is not considered supervised with User Enrollment.The management functionalityavailable to the MDM serverallows it full controlof the managed contentbut is limited from accessing and restrictingpersonal data and settings.Access to personal accounts, apps,and unique device identifiersis unavailable to the MDM server,as are system-wide operationslike remotely wiping the device.We've been hard at work this yearon updates to User Enrollment,and I'm excited to discuss them now.I'll cover Managed Apple IDsand managed apps.Then my colleague Melissa will cover changesto the onboarding flows for users,how to enable ongoing User Authentication,and getting started.Let's start with Managed Apple IDs.In iOS 15, we've improved the experienceof accessing the Managed Account in Settings.When a device is user enrolled,it will now show the account at the top level of settings.From there, you can view details and settings for iCloud.It is now easier than everto manage the additional account.With this re-designed experience,Settings reflects the clear separationof organizational content.Users are able to see which parts of the systemare managed by the organization and which are not.New in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey,Managed Apple IDs support iCloud Drive.iCloud Drive is an important feature of iCloud accountsand now it will be available to user-enrolled devices.On iOS and iPadOS,it shows up as a new location in the Files app.And on macOS, it appearsas an additional location in Finder.With iCloud Drive for Managed Apple IDs,organizations are now ableto easily provide their usersa built-in cloud storage solution.Document browser-based appswill also have access to the additional iCloud Drive.And of course, iCloud Drive will respectManaged Open-in restrictionsfor managed apps and data access.Now let's turn to managed apps.In macOS Big Sur, we enabled managed apps on macOSfor the first time.This allows organizations to install appson a managed device similar to how they can for iOS,including with a custom configuration payload.It also provides the ability to remove the appwith an MDM command or when the device unenrolls.In macOS Monterey,we are expanding the functionalityto user enrollments.Like on iOS,the app data is separated on a different volume.The app is removed during unenrollmentor with an MDM command.When that happens,the data container is also erased.Managed apps that use CloudKitwill now use the Managed Apple IDassociated with the MDM profile.You'll need to add the InstallAsManaged keyto the InstallApplication command.And just a quick reminderthat managed apps need be installedto the Applications folderand should only contain a single app bundle.We recommend that you adopt the useof the Data Protection Keychainand app sandboxingto ensure that data is correctly separated.We've also added some enhancementsto managed apps for all types of enrollmentthat are relevant to user enrollments.First, the restriction functionalityfor Managed Open-Inhas been expanded to include Copy & Paste.This will allow organizations to control datafrom being pasted across the managed boundaryin both directions.There is also now the abilityto specify that a required app is installedwhen a device enrolls in management.The app is approved for installationwhen the device is enrolled,so it doesn't require additional user confirmation.For more information on managed pasteboardand the required app installation,see "What's new in managing Apple devices."Now over to Melissato cover enrollment and ongoing user authentication.Thanks, Timm.With all of these enhancements to User Enrollment,we updated the onboarding flow to be a more personalizedand user-driven experience.The onboarding experience for User Enrollmentintroduced in iOS 13is initiated and driven by an MDM Enrollment profile.This profile has to be created for each userand distributed by their admin.In iOS 15, for a more streamlined experiencefor both users and administrators,we've created a new User Enrollment onboarding flowthat establishes the user's organization identityas the entry point.Users are already familiar withsigning into their organization identityto set up services like Mail and Calendar,so they'll be familiar with setting up MDMon iPhone using their organization identity.This onboarding flow enables new security featuresfor User Enrollment.Now there's a layer of securityduring the enrollment flowwhere your MDM server can verify the userbefore the MDM profile is even downloaded to the deviceand before any organization data is sent to it.Let's take a look at how this new account-based flow works.There are four componentsto the new User Enrollment onboarding flow.Service discovery,where the device identifies the organization's MDM server.User authentication,which is how the MDM server validates the user.Issuing the session token,which is how ongoing authentication is performed.And enrollment, which is the installationof the MDM payload to the device.Let's take a closer look at each of these.When the user starts the onboarding flow,they are prompted to enter their organization identifier.This identifier has two main pieces,delineated by the @ sign.The first piece will be the User ID,and the second piece will be the organization's domainor a sub-domain.After the user has entered their organization ID,the device takes the domain portion of the identifierand turns that into an HTTPS URLpointing to a well-known HTTP resource at that domain.This discovery URLis where you host your MDM server documentthat tells the device where the enrollment endpoint is.The device then performs a GET request to that URL,expecting to get back a JSON document.The received JSON objectincludes a version key to let the device knowwhat type of enrollment the server supportsand a BaseURL key that specifies the URLof the MDM server's enrollment endpoint.With this information, the device is now readyto request the enrollment profile from the server.The device POSTs a property listto the server's enrollment endpointwith various device attributes.If you are familiar withthe over-the-air profile delivery process,you will recognize this as the same requesta device makes to the profile service endpoint.But the key difference here is that the server asks the userto authenticate themselvesbefore it hands over the enrollment profile.It does this by issuing an HTTP 401 Unauthorized responseto challenge the user for credentials.The server must issue this auth challengein order for enrollment to succeed.Importantly, this 401 responseincludes a WWW-Authenticate headerwith information that the device uses to authenticate.This WWW-Authenticate headeruses the Bearer authentication schemeand two additional parameters.The method parameter tells the devicewhat type of authentication is being used.The value indicates that the device will usethe AuthenticationServices web sign-in flowto authenticate the user.For now, that value is fixed.For this method parameter, a URL is also included.The value of this key is an HTTPS URLthat specifies the endpointwhere the authentication happens.This URL should be an endpoint on the MDM server itself.Receipt of this authenticate header kicks offthe AuthenticationServices web sign-in flow.Let's take a look at how that works.The initial content of the web view displayed byAuthenticationServices web sign-in flowis the result of a HTTP GET requestto the authentication endpointspecified by the URL parameter from the 401 response.In a simple case, this web sign-in flowcould display a web formwhere the user would enter their username and password.In more complex cases,it could make use of enterprise single sign-onor even redirect to a third-party identity provideror perform multi-factor authentication.Multiple round trips between the deviceand authentication service can occur.The AuthenticationServices web flow completeswhen the server returns an HTTP redirect responseto the device, like the one seen here.The response includes a Location headerwith a URL using a custom fixed scheme.The URL also includes an access-token parameterwhose value is an opaque tokenthat the device will use as a session tokenwhen making requests to the MDM server.With the session token in-hand,the device re-issues the original HTTP POST requestto fetch the enrollment profile.This time, that request includes an Authorization headerwhich contains the session token as the value.The server validates this token, and upon success,returns the enrollment profile to the device.The user enrollment profile contains two new keysin the MDM payload.First, the AssignedManagedAppleID keyis the Managed Apple ID associatedwith the enterprise user.The user will be requiredto authenticate this Managed Apple IDto sign into the iCloud and iTunes accountsas part of the enrollment flow.A successful MDM enrollmentguarantees that the Managed Apple IDis active on the device.The device will fail to enrollif the AssignedManagedAppleID key is missingor if the user does not successfully authenticate it.And the second new key is the EnrollmentMode key,indicating the enrollment is a BYOD type.The device verifies that this valuematches the mode it is inand will fail the enrollment if there is a mismatchor if the key is not present.Be sure to update your MDM payloadswith both of these new keys.With receipt of the enrollment profile,the device now sets up the requiredManaged Apple ID accountand enrolls with the MDM server.All requests to the server now include the session tokenin the Authorization header for the server to validate.Let's take a look at all of the pieces together.First, the user navigates to the redesigned VPNand Device Management section in Settingsand taps the new Sign In to Work or School button.Then they enter their organization ID,triggering the service discovery step.After discovering the enrollment endpointfrom the domain,the Authentication Services Web UI flow begins.This is an example of a simple web formused for auth.The user enters their organization password.Once the organization's authentication succeeds,we are handed the MDM profile.We take the value of the AssignedManagedAppleID keyfrom the profile and pre-populate itinto the next sign-in screen,where the user enters their password.After this authentication succeeds,the user then allows management of their device.They enter their device passcodeto create an encrypted enterprise data partitionand to authorize the MDM enrollment.The enrollment of the user is successful.And that's the new account-driven onboarding flowfor User Enrollment.In the onboarding flow,we looked at how a server authenticates a userbefore sending enrollment data.With new User Enrollments in iOS 15,we are introducing the abilityfor organizations to reauthenticate the userat any point in time.This makes it possible for your serverand client connection to be more secure than ever.MDM servers can now validate authorizationon every request from the clientand ask the user to re-authenticatetheir identity credentials at any time.This functionality is performedthrough the use of the session token.Here's an example of an MDM clientchecking in with the server to fetch the next MDM command.The Authorization header contains the session token.This is the staple for the two elementsof ongoing authentication.The first element is persistent authorization,where the session token is sentin every client request to the server.The second element is refreshing the session token.This enables the organization administratorto request user re-authentication at any time.By implementing your own server side validation logicof this session token,you can add your organization's security rulesright into your management solution.For example, you can periodically verifya user's credentialsto ensure sensitive payloads are only sent to devicesin possession of trusted users.Let's take a look at how that works.When the session token is invalidated,re-authentication is triggered.The next time the device makes an MDM HTTP request,the now invalid session token included in the HTTP PUTwill trigger a 401 response from the server.The response that the server sendsincludes the same WWW-Authenticate headerthat we saw earlier in the initial authentication exchangeduring the onboarding flow.Of course, because the MDM processruns in the background on devices,this reauthentication request is surfaced to the uservia NotificationCenter.By tapping on the notification,the user continues the re-authentication flowin Settings.The client will start another AuthenticationServicesWeb sign-in flow like the one during the onboarding process.The user will need to authenticate as part ofthe AuthenticationServices web sign-in flowwith either a simple mechanismor a more complex onedecided by the server's integrationwith their identity provider.When that authentication services web flow completes,the server again sends a redirect responsewith the custom Location header,containing a new session token.A successful re-authenticationresults in the device immediately repeatingthe MDM request that initially received the 401 response,continuing right from where it left offwithout action from the server.Just like before,this new session token is included in allsubsequent MDM HTTP requests.If, for any reason,a user's authentication attempt fails,the server may no longer trust the device.In this case, the server can removeany sensitive MDM payloadsor it can completely unenroll the device.And when it comes to unenrolling from MDM,because ongoing authenticationleverages the HTTP 401 response,it's important to note a key difference herebetween profile-based enrollmentsand this new User Enrollment.Before iOS 15,all MDM-enrolled devicestreated a 401 response from the serveras an unenroll command.When this new User Enrollment style is in effect,the 401 response triggers reauthentication instead.To trigger an unenroll,you can still use the existing mechanismof sending the RemoveProfile commandfor the MDM enrollment profile.This will result in a full MDM unenrollas well as a complete managed account,managed data,and data separated volume removal from the device.All unenroll behavior of profile-based enrollments,including the user enrollment flowfrom iOS13,remain unchanged.So that's a quick look into Ongoing Authentication.Now let's help you get started and wrap up.You can get started with the new User Enrollment onboardingand ongoing authentication today with iOS 15.You'll need be sure to do these five things.First, set up and publishan HTTP well-known resource filefor your enterprise domain.Second, integrate your MDM serverwith your Identity Providerto perform user authentication during enrollmentand take advantage of the ongoing authenticationfor added Security benefit.Third, create Managed Apple IDsor use already created Managed Apple IDsfrom Apple School Manager and Apple Business Managerto populate the AssignedManagedAppleID keyin your server's MDM payloads.Update your MDM payload to also includethe new EnrollmentMode key.And lastly, find our new iOS 15Apple Device Management documentationto review our specific updatesalong with all the details that we've gone over today.And that's all you need to get startedwith Account-Based User Enrollments.We covered a lot today,so let's review.The new iCloud Drive support for Managed Apple IDsbrings a built-in cloud storage optionto your organization.You can now manage apps on macOS in User Enrollment.Build support for the new onboarding flowin your MDM solutionor encourage your MDM providerto support the new account-driven onboardingto make user enrollment easier than ever before.Incorporate ongoing authenticationwith your accounts throughout your management workflows.Take advantage of these new featuresstarting in iOS 15 and macOS Montereyto significantly improvethe Bring Your Own Device workflowfor both you and your users.Thanks for joining us today,and have a great WWDC.[music]

Hi, I'm Timm Hannon,an engineering manager in Core OS here at Apple.In this session, my colleague Melissa Nierle and Iwill cover User Enrollments for MDM.

User Enrollment is designed for BYOD,or Bring Your Own Device deploymentswhere the user, not the organization,owns the device.Because the user owns the device,User Enrollment has a limited setof payloads and restrictionsthat can be applied to the deviceby the Mobile Device Management solution.And it's available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

Security and privacy are at the heartof everything we do here at Apple.User Enrollment is a great device management optionthat incorporates both.Its design allows the user to be comfortablethat their privacy and personal data are protected,while the organization can be confident their data is secure.

There are three core componentsthat form the basis of User Enrollment.

The first is a Managed Apple ID.Managed Apple IDs provide accessto Apple Services such as iCloud.

They are owned and managed by an organizationand are available through Apple Business Managerand Apple School Manager.They support federation with Azure Active Directoryso that users can authenticatewith their organization's existing credentials.

The second is Data Separation.

During enrollment, a separate APFS volumewith different cryptographic keys is created.Data from managed apps and managed accountsis kept securely on this volumeaway from personal content.When the device unenrolls from management,the volume and the cryptographic keys are erased.

And finally, the Management Capabilitiesare limited to those that are appropriatefor controlling the organization's contenton the device.

The user owns and has been using the device,so it's critical to protect their privacy.

With User Enrollments, the user maintains controlof their personal data on the device.The device is not considered supervised with User Enrollment.

The management functionalityavailable to the MDM serverallows it full controlof the managed contentbut is limited from accessing and restrictingpersonal data and settings.Access to personal accounts, apps,and unique device identifiersis unavailable to the MDM server,as are system-wide operationslike remotely wiping the device.

We've been hard at work this yearon updates to User Enrollment,and I'm excited to discuss them now.I'll cover Managed Apple IDsand managed apps.Then my colleague Melissa will cover changesto the onboarding flows for users,how to enable ongoing User Authentication,and getting started.
