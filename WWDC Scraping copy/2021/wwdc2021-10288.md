Introducing SF Symbols

Search this video…♪ Bass music playing ♪♪Paul Sim: Hi there! I'm Paul,and I work on the SF Symbols app.Today, we're going to go through some of the awesome new featureswe've added to the app this year and talk abouthow the SF Symbols app can help you create your own apps,whether you're a designer, a developer,or a little bit of both.First, we'll go over how to find symbols to use in your projectsand preview how they'll look.Then we'll talk abouthow the app can help manage custom symbols that you create.And finally, we'll show you how you can copy and export symbolsfor use throughout all stages of the designand development process.Now, I've got an idea for a card game app.I want my family to be able to play games together,even if we can't be in the same room.So let's dive into the SF Symbols appand find some symbols I can use in my UI.First off, I'll start by making a collectionusing the plus button here in the corner,so I can keep symbols for my card game togetherand find them quickly later on.Now, let's start finding some symbols.It won't be much of a family game nightif I'm the only one playing,so let's look for a symbol I can use for inviting other players.You can browse the SF Symbols catalog by categoryhere in the sidebar.The Human category has some symbolsthat could be perfect for adding a player.I'll drag and drop this symbol with a person and a plusonto my Card Game collection so I can find it quickly later on.Well, once we've invited some players, we'll need some cards.I'll need symbols for spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds --the four suits of cards.So I'll search for the word "suit" up here in the toolbar,which filters the system-provided catalogof symbols.And SF Symbols has me covered here, too.I will add the filled versions of these suitsto my Card Game collection.Some symbols for moving cards around in the deckcould come in handy.Let's search for the word "stack"and find a few more symbols to use.And finally, I want to make surenew players can get their bearingswhen facing off against some of the card experts in my family,so we should have a rule book, too.One more search for "book"and one more symbol to add to my collection.Great, now I've got an easy-to-get-to shortlistof all the symbols I've found for my project.So what's next?Well, the SF Symbols library is constantly growing,so it's important to make sure I can use these symbolson all of the platforms I want my app to run on.Let's take a look at my Add Player symbol.I know that some of my family membersare still running older OS's,so I want to make sure that my app runs on iOS 13.I can see here in the information inspectorthat the name person.fill.badge.plushas been available in monochrome since SF Symbols version 2.0,which corresponds to iOS 14; that's too new for me.However, there's another name down herewith a warning symbol next to it.That is a deprecated name,which will work if I need to target older platforms.person.badge.plus.fill is available in monochromegoing all the way back to SF Symbols 1.0,which corresponds to iOS 13.So I can use that name if I want to maintain compatibilitywith iOS 13 and other older platforms.But remember that deprecated names are, well, deprecated.So, you should move to the newer names as soon as you can.Once I know my family has updated their devicesand I'm ready to drop support for older OS's,I should switch to using the more modern namefor this symbol.What else should I checkbefore I'm ready to use these symbols in my app?Well, lots of my family members use languagesother than American English on their devices,and I want to make sure that my card game applooks great for them, too.The information inspector also shows how a symbol's appearancewill change in different localizations.The symbol I grabbed for my rule book earlierautomatically appears with a characterin the user's native script.It even adjusts the direction that the book opensto account for differencesbetween left-to-right and right-to-left languages.So that means, with zero extra work from me,every member of my family is going to see a bookwith a character from their preferred language,which is pretty awesome.Now, it is possible to specify a particular localizationin Xcode using suffixes like .ar or .zh, but in general,you'll want to use the symbol name with no localization suffixand let the system choose the proper representationfor your user's preferred language.Now, let's get an idea of what these symbols will look likein our app.Using the rendering inspector, I can controlhow the symbols are rendered here in the appand see how they'll look next to each other.Let's take a quick tour through the different rendering modes.In Monochrome mode,I can choose a single color to use when rendering symbols,like the built-in system purple.Or I can choose a custom color.If I switch to Multicolor mode,the symbols take on colors intrinsic to their meaning.The heart and diamond suits turn red,and the spade and club turn black.In fact, the spade and club will even adjust their colorto account for Dark Mode,which I can test using the Background picker here.And I can pick a color to use for the parts of symbolsthat don't have an intrinsic color.This year, we introduced the Hierarchical rendering modewhich takes a single colorand uses opacity to add depth and interest to symbols.I can pick a single color and see how different partsof the symbol use different levels of opacity to stand out.And finally, the new Palette rendering modeprovides finer-grained control.I can specify two or three different colors to useduring rendering and see how that affects the symbols.For a deeper dive into the different rendering modesand when you might want to use them,along with some insight into the latest additions to SF Symbols,check out Thalia's session, "What's new in SF Symbols."All right, now I've got a bunch of SF Symbols picked outthat are going to speed up the design and developmentof my app --not to mention make it look amazing.There are now over 3000 SF Symbolsbuilt into Apple platforms.But what if we need something for our app that isn't covered?That's where custom symbols come in.Since the queen of hearts plays such an important rolein so many card games,I want to make sure that she has a special symbol in my app.There isn't a symbol in the system set for this,so it's time to make my own custom symbol.Now, I like the built-in crown SF Symbol,and I think that's a great place to start for my custom design.So I'll select crown.fill,and choose File > Duplicate as Custom Symbol.And that's it, I've just created a custom symbol.From here, I can give it a more descriptive namelike queen.heart.fill,and start making changes to the design.To change the shape of a custom symbol,I'll export a template SVG file,open it with a vector editor like Sketch,and make my modifications to the design.Once I'm done, I can just drag and drop the edited templateback onto my custom symbol in the SF Symbols app,and my symbol will update instantly.Now, like I said earlier, I want to make sureour queen has a symbol that really pops,so I want my new custom symbol to use the new rendering modesthat were introduced this year.When I switch to a rendering mode like Multicolor,in the sidebar with my custom symbol selected,I can see a new set of controls that allow meto annotate my symbol and opt into the new rendering modes.I can also use the new Gallery viewto get a big representation of my symbol to edit.For Multicolor mode, let's make the heart part of the crown redand the lower part of the crown yellow.I'll select the heart and drag it to a new layer.Then I can set the new layer's color to redand set the older layerwith the lower parts of the crown's color to yellow.In Hierarchical mode,we'll put the heart on a primary layerand the rest of the crown on a secondary layer.Well, the default layer is already set to Primary,so let's grab the two lower parts of the crownand drag them to a new layer.Since I've already got a primary layer,the new layer that's created is automatically set to Secondary,so I'm done.OK, now that I'm done annotating,let's add my symbol to my Card Game collectionto keep it with all my other symbols.Once it's part of my collection,I can see how it looks alongside other system symbolsusing all the new rendering modes.If you'd like to do a deep diveinto how to make your own custom symboland learn about some of the awesome new thingsthat were added to custom symbol templates this year,you can find all of thatin the "Create Custom Symbols" session with Mike.All right, I've got my collection of symbolsready to go.Now it's time to get them into my designs and into my code.Let's start with a simple case for a design comp.Remember the book symbol I grabbed for my rule book?I want to mock up a button with that symbol and the word "Rules"so users know they can tap for more informationon how to play the game.So I'm using a system-provided SF Symbol,I'm placing it alongside text,and I'm planning on using the Monochrome rendering mode.In this case, the absolute best way to get this symbolinto a design app is to use the SF fontsthat were installed alongside the SF Symbols app.To do this, I'll choose Edit > Copy Symbol --or press Command-C -- and paste into my design app.This will paste the symbol as text.I can add the word "Rules" to it --right alongside it -- in the same text box.Using the SF fonts means that the pasted symbolwill be aligned and weight-matchedwith text around it,with no additional work required from me.And the kind of design that requiresno additional work from me is my favorite kind of design.For more information on using the SF fonts,check out the "SF Symbols 2" session from WWDC20.So that's the story for system symbols in monochrome.But what about our special queen of hearts symbol?Since it's a custom symbol,rather than a built-in system symbol,we can't use the SF fonts.And what about system symbols using rendering modeslike Multicolor or Hierarchical?Well, I'm super excited to announce that the SF Symbols appnow supports copying images of symbolsto place in your design comps.Just select a symbol, pick the correct weight in the toolbar,and set up the rendering inspector.Then, choose Edit > Copy Image --or press Option-Command-C --and paste into your design.You can also choose Edit > Copy Image As...to control the format of the copied image.Symbols can be copied in either PNG or SVG format,and you can specify a point size and pixel scale.The SF Symbols app will keep using these settingsfor copying images until you come back and reconfigure them.Note that copied images of symbolsmay have some extra vertical padding added to them.This is done so that the vertical centerof the symbol images will align, so it's easy to workwith several symbols in a horizontal row.Now, unlike using the SF fonts,these images aren't guaranteed to be weight-matchedor automatically aligned with text near them,but we're really excited about the flexibilitythat this new feature brings to designing with symbols.Remember that Copy Image is intended to be usedwhen you're making design comps.It's the best way to get your custom symbolsinto your designs, and it will be a big helpwhen you're designing with symbols that use rendering modeslike Multicolor, Hierarchical, or Palette.I won't go into much detail about using SF Symbolsin code here, but I want to mention a common sticking point.When copying an SF Symbol for use in code,make sure you're copying the name of the symbol,rather than the symbol itself.And though it may be temptingto use the new Copy Image feature to bring a symbolinto an asset catalog,you should instead use the Export Symbol optionto make sure you get all the featuresthat a full custom symbol provides.For more information on using SF Symbols in code,check out Tom and Jacob's sessionson using SF Symbols in SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit.So the SF Symbols app is here to help youthroughout your entire design and development process.You can keep the symbols you're using close at handwith collections and preview what the symbols will look likein your app using different rendering modes.You can create your own custom symbolsand adopt the new rendering modes to give your appits own special personality,while making sure it looks right at home on Apple platforms.And of course, you can copy or export symbolsto use in your design comps and Xcode projectsto make an app that looks and feels great.And that's what's new in the SF Symbols app this year.We hope that it will help you design and develop accessible,inclusive, and great-looking apps in record time.And hey, once you're done doing that,you're always welcome to join my family for a game of cards.♪

Then we'll talk abouthow the app can help manage custom symbols that you create.

And finally, we'll show you how you can copy and export symbolsfor use throughout all stages of the designand development process.

Now, I've got an idea for a card game app.

I want my family to be able to play games together,even if we can't be in the same room.

So let's dive into the SF Symbols appand find some symbols I can use in my UI.

First off, I'll start by making a collectionusing the plus button here in the corner,so I can keep symbols for my card game togetherand find them quickly later on.

Now, let's start finding some symbols.

It won't be much of a family game nightif I'm the only one playing,so let's look for a symbol I can use for inviting other players.

You can browse the SF Symbols catalog by categoryhere in the sidebar.

Well, once we've invited some players, we'll need some cards.

I'll need symbols for spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds --the four suits of cards.

So I'll search for the word "suit" up here in the toolbar,which filters the system-provided catalogof symbols.

And SF Symbols has me covered here, too.

I will add the filled versions of these suitsto my Card Game collection.

Some symbols for moving cards around in the deckcould come in handy.

Let's search for the word "stack"and find a few more symbols to use.

And finally, I want to make surenew players can get their bearingswhen facing off against some of the card experts in my family,so we should have a rule book, too.

One more search for "book"and one more symbol to add to my collection.

Great, now I've got an easy-to-get-to shortlistof all the symbols I've found for my project.

So what's next?Well, the SF Symbols library is constantly growing,so it's important to make sure I can use these symbolson all of the platforms I want my app to run on.

Let's take a look at my Add Player symbol.

I know that some of my family membersare still running older OS's,so I want to make sure that my app runs on iOS 13.

However, there's another name down herewith a warning symbol next to it.

That is a deprecated name,which will work if I need to target older platforms.

person.badge.plus.fill is available in monochromegoing all the way back to SF Symbols 1.0,which corresponds to iOS 13.

So I can use that name if I want to maintain compatibilitywith iOS 13 and other older platforms.

But remember that deprecated names are, well, deprecated.

So, you should move to the newer names as soon as you can.

Once I know my family has updated their devicesand I'm ready to drop support for older OS's,I should switch to using the more modern namefor this symbol.

Now, I like the built-in crown SF Symbol,and I think that's a great place to start for my custom design.

And that's it, I've just created a custom symbol.

To change the shape of a custom symbol,I'll export a template SVG file,open it with a vector editor like Sketch,and make my modifications to the design.

In Hierarchical mode,we'll put the heart on a primary layerand the rest of the crown on a secondary layer.

Well, the default layer is already set to Primary,so let's grab the two lower parts of the crownand drag them to a new layer.

Since I've already got a primary layer,the new layer that's created is automatically set to Secondary,so I'm done.

OK, now that I'm done annotating,let's add my symbol to my Card Game collectionto keep it with all my other symbols.

All right, I've got my collection of symbolsready to go.

Now it's time to get them into my designs and into my code.

Let's start with a simple case for a design comp.

Remember the book symbol I grabbed for my rule book?I want to mock up a button with that symbol and the word "Rules"so users know they can tap for more informationon how to play the game.

So I'm using a system-provided SF Symbol,I'm placing it alongside text,and I'm planning on using the Monochrome rendering mode.

In this case, the absolute best way to get this symbolinto a design app is to use the SF fontsthat were installed alongside the SF Symbols app.

To do this, I'll choose Edit > Copy Symbol --or press Command-C -- and paste into my design app.

This will paste the symbol as text.

I can add the word "Rules" to it --right alongside it -- in the same text box.

Using the SF fonts means that the pasted symbolwill be aligned and weight-matchedwith text around it,with no additional work required from me.

And the kind of design that requiresno additional work from me is my favorite kind of design.

For more information on using the SF fonts,check out the "SF Symbols 2" session from WWDC20.

So that's the story for system symbols in monochrome.

But what about our special queen of hearts symbol?Since it's a custom symbol,rather than a built-in system symbol,we can't use the SF fonts.

And what about system symbols using rendering modeslike Multicolor or Hierarchical?Well, I'm super excited to announce that the SF Symbols appnow supports copying images of symbolsto place in your design comps.

Just select a symbol, pick the correct weight in the toolbar,and set up the rendering inspector.

Then, choose Edit > Copy Image --or press Option-Command-C --and paste into your design.

You can also choose Edit > Copy Image As...

to control the format of the copied image.

Symbols can be copied in either PNG or SVG format,and you can specify a point size and pixel scale.

The SF Symbols app will keep using these settingsfor copying images until you come back and reconfigure them.

Note that copied images of symbolsmay have some extra vertical padding added to them.

This is done so that the vertical centerof the symbol images will align, so it's easy to workwith several symbols in a horizontal row.

Now, unlike using the SF fonts,these images aren't guaranteed to be weight-matchedor automatically aligned with text near them,but we're really excited about the flexibilitythat this new feature brings to designing with symbols.

Remember that Copy Image is intended to be usedwhen you're making design comps.

It's the best way to get your custom symbolsinto your designs, and it will be a big helpwhen you're designing with symbols that use rendering modeslike Multicolor, Hierarchical, or Palette.

I won't go into much detail about using SF Symbolsin code here, but I want to mention a common sticking point.

When copying an SF Symbol for use in code,make sure you're copying the name of the symbol,rather than the symbol itself.

And though it may be temptingto use the new Copy Image feature to bring a symbolinto an asset catalog,you should instead use the Export Symbol optionto make sure you get all the featuresthat a full custom symbol provides.

For more information on using SF Symbols in code,check out Tom and Jacob's sessionson using SF Symbols in SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit.

So the SF Symbols app is here to help youthroughout your entire design and development process.

You can keep the symbols you're using close at handwith collections and preview what the symbols will look likein your app using different rendering modes.

You can create your own custom symbolsand adopt the new rendering modes to give your appits own special personality,while making sure it looks right at home on Apple platforms.

And of course, you can copy or export symbolsto use in your design comps and Xcode projectsto make an app that looks and feels great.

And that's what's new in the SF Symbols app this year.

We hope that it will help you design and develop accessible,inclusive, and great-looking apps in record time.
