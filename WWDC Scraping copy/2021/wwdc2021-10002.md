What's new in SwiftUI

Search this video…Hello and welcome to “What’s new in watchOS 8.”My name is Jake Behrens, and I’m Apple’s Watch Evangelist.watchOS 7 opened up many new opportunities,with features like Family Setup, allowing family members to stayconnected without an iPhone; multiple complications,allowing you to create richer experiences for the watch face;and watch face sharing, which allows you to createa watch face that’s all your own with complicationsthat you love that you can share with someone or post online.In watchOS 8, we’ve focused on someof your top requests to help you createeven more incredible Watch app experiences.There’s a lot to talk about, so let’s dive in.First is the Always-On Display.Apple Watch Series 5 and watchOS 6 broughtthe Always-On Display to the watch face,and now in watchOS 8, we’re bringingthe Always-On Display to your apps.I’m also going to talk about how you can take advantageof background deliveryof HealthKit data and Bluetooth scanningto keep health-related complications up to date.Apple Watch has become more independent over time.With watchOS 8,we’re bringing region-based user notifications to the wrist.I’m going to talk about how these can bringrelevant information to someone at the right timein the right places.Finally, I’ll talk about some new systemand API enhancements coming to watchOS 8that make developing and using Watch apps even better.Let’s start with the Always-On Display.The Always-On Display allows you to see contenton your watch without having to raise your wrist.When you raise your wrist, the display is active again.The Always-On Display is supportedon Apple Watch Series 5 and 6.In watchOS 7, the always-on stateshowed your app’s UI blurred with the time overlaid.When you rebuild your app with the watchOS 8 SDK,your app’s UI will now be shown in a dimmed state insteadand is immediately interactive if someone taps the UI.In the always-on state, the system automaticallyreduces the overall brightness of the displaywhile keeping it bright enough for someone to see.To help you adapt your app’s UIto this reduced brightness,we’re introducing a SwiftUI environment propertycalled isLuminanceReduced.You can respond to this state by highlighting informationthat’s especially importantand hiding information that should stay private.To help you iterate quickly,we’ve included support for this environment propertyin Xcode previews as well as in the simulator.In the simulator, you click a buttonin the window to simulate a wrist-down event.This will be really helpful when you want to seehow your app’s UI responds to the always-on state.Now let’s talk about some guiding principlesfor your app’s UI in the always-on state.The transition from active state to the always-on stateshould feel seamless.Don’t drastically alter the UI or reorganize information.Otherwise the transition from the always-on stateto being active will be jarring.Maintaining the context of the active UI is key.In this example, Fitbod keeps the UI groundedand consistent between states while further dimming someof the brighter elements and secondary text.Next,you should dim non-essential information and elements.If you have secondary text, images, or fills,you can further dim them yourselfto give more prominence to the piece of informationyou want to stay highlighted and visible.AnyList, which helps you create and share grocery shopping listsand organize recipes, removes the background of list itemsand further dims the secondary information,like which flavor of Greek yogurt or how much milk.This allows the main list item titleto be even more glanceable, as you might be pushinga shopping cart or carrying a shopping basket.If your UI has large elements that are filledwith color or imagery, you may want to reduce those elementsto be represented with a stroke or dimmed color,again maintaining the UI’s groundingbut allowing your highlighted information to still be visible.In this example, Pandora dims secondary controlsalong the bottom and removes the album artworkand uses a similar but dimmed color.This works really well to highlight the song nameand artist name at a quick glance.When luminance is reduced, you may also wantto redact or remove sensitive information.Information like account numbers, balances,shown in this example, and some personal health datamay be good candidates to obscurefrom prying eyes while someone’s wrist is down.To learn more about redaction using SwiftUI,see the “Principles of great widgets” videoin the Developer app,since widgets share a similar redaction model.Finally, if you have animations happening,you should reset them to the first frameof their loop or resolve them to a rested state.It’s best to not leave them mid-animation.Now that you know how to make your UI look its bestin the always-on state, let’s talkabout the technical sideof how you update your app's UI while the wrist is down.For apps with an ongoing, active sessionlike a workout session or audio sessionthat gives you continuous runtime,you can update your UI up to once per second.This allows you to keep counters,metrics, and other data up to date,though will require you to removesub-second incrementing, like tenths of seconds.For apps without an active session,you may update up to once per minute.While the default timeout before the system returnsto the clock face is two minutes,you should plan for your app being visible longer than this,as your customers may change this setting.So how do you tell us that your inactive app needsto update its UI?For that, we’ve created a TimelineView in SwiftUI.TimelineView takes a scheduleand constructs a view dependent on a date.When it comes to scheduling updates,we’ve provided a handful of TimelineSchedulesto help you do whatever is right for your app.There is Every minute, which updates every minute.This also aligns to the system clock, meaning that each updatewill occur at the top of the minute on the device.There’s Periodic, which allows you to set an interval,such as every two minutesor whatever is appropriate for your app.If you use a periodic schedule for one-minute intervals,they are not aligned to the system clock.This can be really useful if you need to time an updatein relation to a specific event, like when a workout was started.There’s Explicit, if you have changes that occurat specific times, such as needing an update at 1.5 minutesfollowed by an update 2.5 minutes later, and so on.There’s also Custom.This can work really well if you have somethinglike a timer that updates every minute but you’d like itto update once per second for the last 60 seconds.If your app is not in an active session and you tell usthat you need faster updates for a short period,as in the last 60 seconds of this timer,the system will attempt to do so,but those updates are not guaranteed.Finally, there’s an Animation schedule.To learn more about TimelineView, schedules,animations, and more, watch the “What’s new in SwiftUI"and the “Add rich graphics to your SwiftUI app” videosin the Developer app.We love the impact that healthand fitness apps have made on Apple Watch.In watchOS 8, we’ve brought background deliveryof HealthKit data to Watch apps.This opens up passive health monitoring for appsand can make a big impact for standalone Watch appsused in Family Setup configurations.Setting up background delivery of HealthKit dataworks similarly to iOS.On watchOS, when the predicate matches due to new health databeing collected and your background observer querygets handled, your app is woken to receive results.This can be up to once per hour for a Watch app.If someone has added your app’s complicationsto their active watch face,you can receive results up to four times per hour.All of these opportunities will count against your app’sbackground app refresh budget, so they will only add upto a maximum of four results being received per hour andcould impact background app refresh wakes for other reasons.Let’s talk about update frequencies.When we deliver results to your app,we will do it immediately for various critical data types,including fall events,low blood oxygen saturation, heart rate events, and more.Look at the developer documentationon the Apple Developer websitefor the full list of affected data types.All other data types will be delivered hourlyor at longer intervals.We’ve also added new informationin the HealthKit authorization sheetto let customers know that your app has increasedawareness of their health data on Apple Watch.We think background delivery of HealthKit data willbring new possibilities to healthand fitness related complications on the watch face.In watchOS 4, we enabled Bluetooth devices to connectdirectly to Apple Watch and make use of Core Bluetooth.We’ve seen some really incredible uses of this.In watchOS 8, we’re taking another stepforward and allowing devices to connectduring background app refresh opportunities that your app’scomplications get when they’re on the active watch face.For instance, this is Qardio, which allows people to monitortheir heart conditions with Qardio’s medical grade ECG.And this is Sonra Watch, which allows soccer coaches,or football, for those of you outside of the U.S.,to monitor up to 28 real-time metrics of their players’performance during training using their GPS tracker.With Bluetooth connections during background app refresh,this means that your app’s complications can stayup to date with your Bluetooth deviceand display updated information throughout the day.Background app refresh gives your app’s complicationsthat are on the active watch face up to four opportunitiesper hour to connect and update.Remember that these opportunities will countagainst your app’s overall background app refresh budget.Make sure to set up your initial device connectionwhen the app is in the foreground.This can’t be done from the background.Once a connection to the device is established,background app refresh gives your app the opportunityto connect and get new data.It’s also important to connect and process your datawithin a very short period of time.To help you with this, we’ve addeda new expiration handler on WKRefreshBackgroundTaskso you can be told when you’re about to run out of timeand need to finish up what you’re doing.This allows your app to clean up and degrade gracefullyif needed.For more information, watch “Connect Bluetooth devicesto Apple Watch” in the Developer app.Apple Watch is the device that’s always on you.With independent Watch apps becoming more prevalent andcustomers increasingly running out for coffee or to the storewith only their watch, location is a key partof staying on top of what’s important.In watchOS 8,we’re bringing region-based user notifications to Apple Watch.This means you can get notified of important thingsbased on geofences.For example, you can be reminded to startyour skiing workout when you’re at the lift, using Slopes.Or you can receive your flight informationwhen you get to the airport using App in the Air.Region-based user notifications on watchOSwork similarly to iOS.To preserve your customers’ privacy,they will first receive a static notification wherethey can tap a button to see the full dynamic notification.This allows you to deliver pre-created local notificationsbased on someone entering or exiting a region you’ve setfor a notification trigger based on location.Keep in mind that the “When in use” permission is requiredfor you to take advantage of this.You should also limit the number of regions to only includeimportant points of interest near someoneor locations they’ve shown explicit intent for,like setting a favorite store location.Regions are most power-effective when they'reabout a couple hundred meters in radius.Alongside region-based user notifications, watchOS 8supports the new location button in Core Location.This button gives a one-time location authorization withoutgoing through authorization prompts each time it’s tapped.Behind the scenes,it acts like an "Allow once” traditional authorization.The location button is an easy way to gain trustfrom people by giving them more controlof when they want to share their location.For more information on Core Location updatesin watchOS 8 and iOS 15, watch “Meet the location button"available in the Developer app.We’re also introducing a new always-on altimeter APIin Core Motion.This gives you access to real-time elevation updateswith minimal impact to all-day battery life and withoutrequiring someone to share their location with the app.Aside from new features and APIs coming to watchOS 8,we’ve made a lot of enhancements to make developingand using your Watch apps easier than ever.With watchOS 8, Apple Watch can nowmeasure respiratory rate while you sleep.This allows apps like Sleep Details to displayyour respiratory rate data and visualize changeswhen you wake up in the morning.We’re happy to bring AssistiveTouchto Apple Watch for those with limb differences.This is really exciting because we can recognize a person’s handgestures to help them perform actions and navigate UI.We’re also bringing a large accessibility text sizeto watchOS 8.To learn more on making your Watch app more accessible,watch “Create accessible experiences for watchOS”in the Developer app.Unit testing and UI testing for Watch appswas introduced in Xcode 12.5.But making your apps accessible is what allows themto be testable, so with new accessibility featureson watchOS, the time has never been betterto make your apps more accessible.watchOS 8 also adds large titles at the top of scrolling views,like you see in iOS,allowing for a more consistent feel across devices.Text input has been revamped in watchOS 8,remembering if someone prefers Scribbleor Dictation per app, and giving quick accessto changing between input types while entering text.This allows much more text to be easily entered,and you get this functionality free with SwiftUI text fields.The new searchable API allows you to easily add search fieldsto your apps with customized suggestions.Customers will see a button in the search fieldindicating suggestions are available.When they tap on that, they’ll see your customized suggestions.You can also provide customized UI for results.You can learn more by watching the “Craft search experiencesin SwiftUI” video in the Developer app.Lists now support swipe actions, so in addition to removingitems, you can now perform custom actions like favoriting.Button roles let the system know how to present and handlespecific button types, like destructive ones,but they also include a controlProminence modifier,which will give those buttonsan additional haptic when tapped.And the SwiftUI Canvas API is also available on watchOS 8,which means you can do rich programmatic drawingthat uses the incredible GPU found in Apple Watch.There are many reasons to be excitedabout new possibilities on Apple Watch with watchOS 8.TimelineView can help you update your UI when a person’s wristis down and they need to get info at a quick glance.This is something all apps should adopt,so check it out first.Your app’s complications have gained new waysto get updated information to them with background deliveryof HealthKit data and Bluetooth connections.This further supports that complicationsare a main way some people use Watch apps.If you can deliver more at a glance,you absolutely should.Region-based user notifications haveenhanced what location means to Watch apps.Adopting these where they make sense can add that surpriseand delight moment that keeps customers engaged in your app.And finally, making use of next-level capabilitieslike AssistiveTouch and the SwiftUI Canvas API can makeyour Watch apps more useable and more immersive than ever.I’ll be watching to see what you create.Thank you.[music]
