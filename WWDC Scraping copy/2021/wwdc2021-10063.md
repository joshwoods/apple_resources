Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13

Search this video…♪ ♪Hello!My name is Russell, and I'm an engineer on the UIKit team.In iOS 13, we introduced a refined appearance for sheets,bringing them to Phoneand adding a universal pull-to-dismiss gesture.To learn more about this, watch the videoModernizing Your UI for iOS 13, specifically the section aboutPresentations starting 9 minutes and 45 seconds in.In iOS 15, we've built on that foundationby adding a bunch of customization options to sheets,so you can now use them in fun new ways like never before.We've added support for a medium detent,which allows you to create a vertically resizable sheetthat only covers half the screen.You can also now remove the dimming view,which will allow you to build a nonmodal UIwhere the user can interact with content behind the sheetwhile the sheet is presented.Next, I'll cover some new visual options,including how to get a non-full-screen appearanceon phones in landscape.And finally, I'll show how to set up a UIthat seamlessly adapts between a popoverin regular size classesand a customized sheet in compact size classes.To explore all of this, we've made a sample appfor creating digital postcards,and it's available with this video.For each postcard, I can customize the pictureas well as the text and the font.Now, before I can customize a sheet,first I have to get one.A sheet is an instance of a newUIPresentationController subclasscalled UISheetPresentationController,and all of the customization options are exposedas properties on this class.The typical way to get an instance of this classis to readthe sheetPresentationController propertyon a view controller before you present it.This method returns a non-nil instanceas long the view controller's modalPresentationStyleis form sheet or page sheet, which it is by default.From here, you can then setvarious properties on the instance to customize it.This is the same pattern as getting a view controller'spopoverPresentationController and setting its properties.And with that, let's jump into detents.What are detents?A detent is a height where a sheet naturally rests,and these are defined as a fractionof the fully expanded sheet frame.The fully expanded frame is visualizedon an iPhone and iPad here,and it should be familiar if you've used sheets before.We've exposed two system-defined detents in iOS 15:a medium detent, which is about halfof a sheet's full height, and a large detent,which is the height of a fully expanded sheet.To specify which detents you want a sheet to support,simply set an array of the detents you wanton the detents property.The default value of this property is an arrayof just the large detent, which is why if you don'tset it at all, you get a standard full height sheet.If you set this to an array of the medium and large detents,you get a sheet that is resizablebetween medium and large.But you can also set this to an arrayof just the medium detent,which gives you a sheet that presents at medium heightand cannot be resized to full height.Let's apply this to the sample app.I'm starting with some code that targets the iOS 14 SDKto present the system image picker in a standard sheet.When a button is tapped, this first function is called,which creates an image picker, sets the picker's delegateto self, and then presents the picker.Then when an image is chosen, the picker didFinishPickingdelegate method is called, which then sets the chosen imageon the image view and dismisses the picker.Let's run it.When I tap the photo button,the photo picker covers the whole app.Notice my traveling has recently been very virtual.And when I pick a photo, the photo picker dismisses,revealing the photo I picked in the postcard.But what if I want to pick a different picture?I have to go through this whole flow again.And it would be really nice if I could showmy library of photos and my postcardat the same time.And with a medium detent, I can.Here's the same code as before but with a few changes.Before I present the picker,I access its sheetPresentationControllerand set its detents to medium and large.Also in the picker didFinishPickingdelegate callback, I removed the linethat dismisses the photo picker, because now I don't wantthe photo picker to dismiss when selecting a picture.Now when I run this and tap the photo button,my library comes up at half height,I can pick a photo, and voila.I can see it in my postcard with the library still below.And if I want to try a different photo,it's as simple as one tap.Also, because my detents array includes the large detent,I can drag the bar to resize this sheet to full height.In addition, because the scroll viewis scrolled to top, scrolling the scroll viewwill also expand the sheet.For a sheet of actions like the system Share Sheet,this is a great feature that progressively disclosesmore advanced actions at the bottom of the list.But for this photo library example,I might prefer that scrolling not expand the sheetso the postcard is always visibleunless I explicitly resize the sheetby dragging from the bar.To get this alternate behavior,I just have to set one additional property:PrefersScrollingExpands- WhenScrolledToEdge.By default, this property is true,so setting it to false prevents scrollingfrom expanding the sheet.Now the photo picker doesn't resize when scrolled,but I can still drag the barto get a better view of my photo library.But now when I tap a photo,it's not obvious that anything happened.This is in contrast to the earlier behavior,where tapping a photo dismissed the photo picker,clearly indicating my selection was received.What I'd like is to have the sheet resizeto the medium detent when I tap a photo,both to indicate my selection was receivedand to make my selection visible in the postcard.And I can achieve this by programmatically changingthe selected detent.So if I go back to the image picker delegate methodthat is called whenever a photo is tapped,I can add some code here to get the sheetPresentationControllerand set the selectedDetentIdentifierto medium.Let's try this.Notice the transition when I tap a photo.Whoa!That transition was so fast, I almost lost my eyebrows.It actually didn't animate at all.I can easily animate this transitionby wrapping the setting of the propertyin a sheet.animateChanges block.This will animate the sheet down to the medium detent if neededwith a standard animation curveand animate other sheets in the stack as well,such as the root sheet scaling back up.Buttery smooth.One more nice thing would be to remove the dimming viewto show the selected photo in full color.To do that, there's one more property to look atcalled smallestUndimmed- DetentIdentifier.By default, this property is nil,which means all of the detents are dimmed,but if you want to remove dimming,set it to the identifier of the smallest detentwhere you don't want dimming.In this case, I'll set it to medium.Notice there's no dimming at the medium detentwhen I bring up the picker.Ta-da!But dimming still fades in if I resize to the large detent.More than visually removing the dimming,this property also allows youto build advanced nonmodal experiences,since I can now interactnot only with the content in the sheetbut also with the content outside of the sheet.This is even more profound with the font picker,where I've built a UI that allows me to selecta range of text while the font picker is up,apply a font to just that range,adjust my selection, and apply a font again.Download the sample app for details on how this is achieved.It's also worth noting that medium height sheetssupport automatic keyboard avoidance,so if I search for a font here, the sheet grows automaticallyto account for the keyboard, and when the keyboard dismisses,the sheet automatically collapses back down.So that was a lot of information about detents,but now I'd like to turn our attentionto some other new visual customization optionsfor sheets,starting with a new optional appearance for sheetson iPhone in landscape.In iOS 13, we made all sheets full screen in landscape,and now we've made available an alternate appearancewhere sheets are only attached to the screenat their bottom edge.To get this new appearance, simply setprefersEdgeAttached- InCompactHeight to true.Now just setting this will always give you a sheetthat is as wide as the safe area.If you'd like a sheet whose width followsthe presentedViewControllers preferredContentSize,set widthFollows- PreferredContentSize-WhenEdgeAttached to true.This will make the sheet a narrower default width,and you can set preferredContentSizeto further customize this width.Besides these properties,there is also a property to show a grabber if you like.A grabber often isn't necessary, but in caseswhere it might be less obvious that a sheet is resizable,such as when scrolling doesn't resize the sheet,displaying the grabber can be a helpful indicatorof resizability.Now notice the corners of the sheet.Another option we've exposed is the abilityto customize the corner radius.If your app has a more rounded appearance,you may want to match that aesthetic.Note that the system will keep stacked cornerslooking consistent, so if this photo picker expandsto push back the root sheet,the root sheet will have larger corners to match.Finally, although it's possible to create a sheetwith detents on iPad,often a popover is wanted insteadthat adapts to a sheet in compact,potentially customized with things like detents.Let's take this approach with the sample app.To get a popover for the image picker on iPad,I need to make a few small modifications.First, I'll set the modalPresentationStyleof the picker to popover.Then, instead of grabbing the sheetPresentationController,because this will now return nil,since the modalPresentationStyle is not a sheet,I'll get the popoverPresentationController.I'll set the popover's source to be our barButtonItem,and then I'll grab a new property on the popovercalled the adaptiveSheet- PresentationController.This property returns an instance of the sheetthat the popover will adapt to in compact size classes,and then I'll configure it just as I did the sheet before.Now when I tap a photo button,the photo picker appears in the popover,and if I resize the scene,it adapts to a medium height sheet.It works!And if I expand the picker, and select a photo--oh, no!It didn't automatically resize to medium heightlike we implemented before.Hmm.Let's go back to the pickerdidFinishPicking delegate method.Ah!To get the adaptive sheet, I need to readthe adaptiveSheet- PresentationControlleron the popoverPresentationControllerhere in the code as well.Now notice when I select a photo.Hooray! It resizes back to medium again.Now, I've talked about a lot of stuff herethat will enable you to easily build new types of UIswith sheets that could not be easily built before.Review your own apps for areas that would benefitfrom medium height sheets or nonmodal experiences.If you have any half height custom cards in your apps today,replace them with these newly enhanced UIKit sheets.Thank you for watching, and I look forward to seeingall of the cool new things
you build with sheets.
