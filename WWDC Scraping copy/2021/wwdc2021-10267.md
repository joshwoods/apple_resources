Xcode Cloud,an easy-to-use continuous integrationand delivery service designed for developersjust like you, anyone who’s buildingapps and frameworks for Apple platforms.In this session, we’re gonna startwith an introduction to continuous integrationand meet Xcode Cloud.Then we’ll setup a project, make a code change,and learn how to use Xcode Cloud to collaborate with your team.Let’s get started.Continuous integration or CI is the practiceof integrating code changes regularly,so that issues are caught and fixed early.Adopting this practice allows teamsto work collaborativelywhile also creating high-quality products.A typical CI workflow is a set of automated stepsthat runs when you or a team memberpush a code change to your repository.These steps can do things like build, run tests,or any other number of actionsneeded to ensure that the code changemeets your team’s established level of quality.With CI, you can have peace of mindthat integrating a change is low-riskand that your next release is stable.Now, to think about what CI might look like for you,let’s take a look at the life cycle of an app.As a developer, you’re likely workingwith feedback from multiple sources.You fix bugs and create features in Xcode,you receive code review feedback from your teamon pull requests, and you distributenew versions via TestFlight and integrate tester feedback.Your team’s ability to iterate on codeand feedback productively is essential to creatinga high-quality app or framework.That’s where Xcode Cloud comes in.Xcode Cloud builds upon the idea of CI while connecting the dotsbetween Apple developer tools to provide youwith the complete development pipelineto build, test, distribute,collect feedback, and quickly iterateon your projects.Let’s take a tour of the featuresto learn about what you can do.You spend most of your time developing in Xcode,and Xcode Cloud is right there in Xcode.Here, you can see Xcode Cloud in action.There are multiple workflows set upand builds are running and catching issues.You also get a new insight into all of the workyour team is doing.A workflow is a configuration that tells Xcode Cloudwhich actions to perform and when to perform them.You can breeze through the easy onboardingand get your first workflow up and running quickly.Then you can come back and edit it,or make new workflows to support different use cases.The result of running a workflow is called a build.Xcode Cloud runs buildsin Apple managed Cloud infrastructurethat provides code signing and accessto multiple operating system versionsand Xcode releases.When you click on your appin the Cloud tab of the report navigator,you can view the status of all of your workflowsand the latest builds in the sidebar.Clicking your app also opens the build group overview,which shows all of your builds organized by the wayyour development team works, not just by workflowbut also by git branch, allowing you to use one workflowfor many branches but still see the results separately.You can also filter down the listto see only builds started by your code changes,by clicking the Mine filter above the overview...or by selecting the person icon in the report navigator.One level down from the build group overviewis the build report for a single run of a workflow.This is where you can deep-dive into the resultsspecific to your code change.You can view test reports, logs, and jump directlyinto the code that caused an issue.Geoff will go into more details of the build report later.Everything we just saw is not only available in Xcode,but it’s also available in App Store Connect.This includes starting and viewing builds,managing workflows,viewing and downloading artifacts,sharing results with your team,and managing notification settings.And if you’re already working in TestFlight,Xcode Cloud is the tab right next doorin App Store Connect for quick access.In App Store Connect, you can also set upyour personal notification settings.I like to set up Slack notificationsfor failing builds so I can continue workingafter pushing my code but get alerted quicklyif there’s something to fix.Everyone on your team can set up notificationsthat work best for them.Whether you’re on the go, or want visibility into buildsof a project you don’t have set up in Xcode,or you’re a member of a team who isn’t committing codeto a project, Xcode Cloud in App Store Connectprovides a fully-featured web-based experience.When we created Xcode Cloud, we designed itfor your development processand for collaboration with your team,but it has also been built with privacy at its core.Your source code is the heart of your project.That’s why all aspects of Xcode Cloud are designedto ensure that your data is protected.Build environments are temporary.Workloads are completely isolated,and environments are torn downand created from scratch between builds.Source code is never stored.Xcode Cloud fetches your codeonly within the temporary build environment.Build data is encrypted at rest and storedin a dedicated CloudKit database.And you’re in control of your data.You can delete your data at any time,and it will be completely removedfrom the system.Now that I’ve introduced Xcode Cloud,I’m gonna hand it over to Geoff to walk through getting set up.Let’s get started onboardingto Xcode Cloud.It takes only a few simple steps to get startedthanks to the powerful integrationwith Xcode.The process begins by visitingthe Xcode Cloud section of the product menuand selecting Create Workflow.Next, I select which app I’d like to onboardfrom these options detected for my local project.Today, I’ll pick this new smoothie ordering appmy team is developing called “Fruta.”The app supports both iOS and macOS,and we’ll onboard both platforms together at once.Our app begins with a default first workflowcreated automatically for me.By inspecting my local project, Xcode Cloud can tailorthese initial workflow settings to match my team’sexisting configurations.Workflows are made up of a start condition,an environment, the set of actionsto be performed, and post-actionssuch as deployments and notifications.And I can see Xcode Cloud selected every pushto the main branch as the start condition,the latest released Xcode for my environment,and archive actions for both iOS and macOS.I have the option of changing these settings,but this looks good to me, so I’ll continue on.For a deep dive into workflow editing,check out the “Explore Xcode Cloud Workflows” sessionlater in the conference.Next, I’ll authorize Xcode Cloud to access my source code.This is a one-time action covering all source repositoriesrequired to build my project including the primary repo,any submodules, and private Swift packages.For any publicly accessible repositories,no additional authorization is necessary.Xcode Cloud discovered the two private reposwithin my project, so, next, we’ll grantexplicit permissions to GitHub where the source is hosted.Clicking Grant Access takes me to App Store Connectwith more details about the next steps.It’s important to note that this process will varydepending on the source provider,and I can revoke access at any time for any reason.Granting source code accessto Xcode Cloud is completed on the web,and this assistant guides me through the process.First, I connect my Apple ID with my source account,which is used to enable a personalized experiencein Xcode Cloud.This step leveragesthe provider’s native authentication flowand Xcode Cloud’s secure encryption,so I know my code and personal informationremain protected.Then I install the Xcode Cloud applicationto my GitHub organization,enabling access to the repos I select.Great!With those steps complete, my GitHub account is all set.Let’s finish the onboarding in Xcode locally.Repositories are ready. I’ll continue.In the final step, Xcode Cloud will offerto register my applicationand bundle ID to App Store Connect.Our application is already created,so I’ll just confirm the details here.Everything looks good.Now that my app is configured for Xcode Cloud,I can wrap up the onboarding process,which will kick off my first build.Looks like my first build is finished.Let’s take a deeper look at the results.The build group overview shows my activeand completed builds at a glance,and clicking the first entryopens up the overview page for our build.This overview shows me brief details about the buildsuch as durations and environment configurations,with the lower section showing me the statusof all actions and post-actions involved.Also, the top-right has helpful buttonsto rebuild the run again, and check out this revisionin my local environment.Leaving the overview and expanding an action node,such as the passing “Archive-iOS” oneshows the summary of this specific action.And within the view, I can find logs and artifactsproduced by this run.The logs page neatly organizes all the taskswithin this action, with filters availableat the top to focus on areas that need attention.I also have easy access to binaries,log files, and other artifacts producedby my build in the artifacts page.This all makes for a very convenient wayfor my teammates and I to access our CI contentright here in Xcode.Now let’s investigate why the Mac archive action failedby visiting the action summary.Similar to the logs view, I can filter these issuesby type for efficient triage.Looks like our first CI build caught an import issueI previously missed for our Mac app,and since I’m triaging my results in Xcode,I can use this jump button within an issueto navigate directly to the code I need to fix.I’ll make a quick code change to clean things up.And I want our CI builds to get off to a good start,so I’ll go ahead and commitand push it to my remote repository.And right after I push my change,I see Xcode Cloud has started a new build for me.And I can continue to follow alongwith all my changes live.I’m pretty excited with my quick progress.By running our CI builds on Apple’s Cloud Infrastructure,our team will collaborate on our projectmore efficiently than ever.Now, back to Holly to join in on the fun.Thanks, Geoff,for getting Xcode Cloud set upand running for our project Fruta.As a member of the same team,I can open the Fruta Xcode projecton my Mac and see all of the workflowsand builds that Geoff and the rest of our teamhave been working on.Here in the report navigator on the Cloud tabwhen I click on my project name,because workflows are shared within teams,I can see the default workflow that Geoff just created.It looks like Build 2 that Geoff startedwhen he fixed the import error has completed successfully.Now that we have a passing build,let’s edit the workflow to see what it does,and find out what improvements we can maketo get additional coverage for Fruta.I can right-click on the workflow nameand select Edit Workflow.Let’s start by giving the workflowa more descriptive name.Let’s call this workflow “Releases”since we’re gonna be building and testinga couple of branches we use for our releases.Now, let’s edit the start condition.I’ll select the start condition sectionfrom the sidebar to bring up the configuration.Remember, the start condition defines what needs to happento cause the workflow to run.The default is set to start when a code changeis pushed to your main branch.My team also uses a release branch,so let’s go ahead and add that here too.I just click on the plus button in the custom branches sectionand type my branch name in the table row.That looks good for the start condition.Now let’s move on to actions.The default workflow automatically createsarchive actions for all platformsthat my project runs on.This is a great foundation to build upon,but to add some additional coverage,I’d like to add some tests here.I click the plus buttonto the right of the Actions headerin the sidebar and select the Test action type.For the Test action, I can select the platform--let’s do iOS--then select the correct scheme, Fruta iOS in our case.In the sidebar, there’s still a red Xnext to our new Test action because we haven’t yetfilled out everything that’s required.The last setting I need to configureis adding some devices for these tests to run on.Clicking the plus button below the Destination tableautomatically adds recommended iPhone simulators...And clicking one more time adds recommended iPads.I can also change these to pick a specific device simulator.Let’s choose the latest iPhone to make sure my appworks great on iPhone 12.Notice that all of the destinationsI’ve added are automatically set to use the latest OS version.I can review my workflow in the sidebar,and everything looks good to me, so let’s save the changesby clicking the Save button in the bottom right-hand corner.Now that we’ve made changes to the workflow,I want to make sure it works without having to makea code change to start it.I can do that manually by right-clickingon the workflow in the report navigatorand selecting Start Build.Next, I’m prompted to choose which branch I want to run.Let’s try it with “release/v1”since we’ve just added that branch to the workflow.And from here, I click Start Buildto kick it off.Great, it looks like our new build is running.Now, in the build group overview,there’s a new section for our release/v1 branch,and the new build I just started, Build 3,appears here with a running status.After this completes, I’ll have a good ideaof how our release branch is doing.Then I can continue to add to the release workflowor create new ones to support how my team works.Xcode Cloud made it really simpleto adopt a continuous integration practicefor our app.With just a few clicks, Geoff got us set upand fixed an issue that the workflow found.Then I was able to easily see everything he had already done,and make our workflow more robust.Your team’s ability to iterate on both codeand feedback productively is essential to creatinga high-quality app or framework.With Xcode Cloud, you can easily setup CI,and whether this is a totally new practiceor makes your process seamless,you can be more productive and feel more confidentthat your users will have a great experiencewith your product.We hope this session helped you get acquaintedwith Xcode Cloud and Continuous Integration.From our team in Vancouver, Canada,and on behalf of Geoff and myself,thank you and enjoy the rest of WWDC 2021.[upbeat music]
