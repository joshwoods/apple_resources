Hi, I'm Zhenchao.I have been working on a new feature of the Dogs appthat shows how many people favorited a dog photo.Right now, I can pull down the scroll viewto refresh favorite counts.I would like to update these favorite counts in real time.That way, the app feels much more interactive.To do that, our back-end engineers have builta real-time events endpointthat gives us live updates to photos.I'm going to check out the endpointto examine the response.Each line of the response body is a piece of JSON datathat describes updates to a photo,such as updated favorite counts.Let's use the new async sequence APIto consume the response of the endpointand update the favorite counts as real-time events are parsed.We can kick off the live updates in the onAppearHandler function,which is an action calledwhen the photo collection view appears.Within the function,I'm going to call the new URLSession.bytes APIto fetch data from our new endpoint.Note that the bytes returned herehave a type of URLSession.AsyncBytes.This gives us a way to incrementally consumeresponse body.I also added error checking hereto make sure that we did get a successful response from server.We want to parse each line of the responseas a piece of JSON data.To do that, we can use the lines method on AsyncBytes.This enables us to consume the response line by lineas data is received.Within the loop, I can just parse the JSON dataand update my UI by calling updateFavoriteCount.Note that the UI updates need to happen on the main actor,and that's why I'm using await syntaxto call updateFavoriteCount, which is an async function.Great. Now these favorite counts are updated in real time.Back to you, Guoye.Guoye: Zhenchao just showed us how to usean AsyncSequence built-in transformation --lines -- to parse response body line by line.AsyncSequence supports many convenience transformations,and you can also use AsyncSequencewith other system framework APIs such as FileHandle.To learn more about AsyncSequence,I encourage you to watch the video "Meet AsyncSequence".URLSession is designed around a delegate modelwhich provides callbacks for events such asauthentication challenges, metrics, and more.The new async methods no longer expose the underlying task,so how do we handle authentication challengesspecific to a task?Yes, all of those methods can take an additional argument --a task-specific delegate --allowing you to provide an objectto handle delegate messages specific to this data upload,download, or bytes operation.We are also introducing the delegate propertyon NSURLSessionTask in Objective-Cfor you to take advantage of the same capability.The delegate is strongly held by a taskuntil it completes or fails.It's worth noting that task-specific delegateis not supported by background URLSession.If a method is implemented on both session delegateand task delegate, the one on task delegate will be called.Now, Zhenchao will show ushow to use a task-specific delegateto handle authentication challenges.Zhenchao: Thanks, Guoye!Our Dogs app has a simple data-fetching layerwritten with the new async APIs.For some of our data-fetching tasks,such as marking a photo as favoriteor fetching all favorited photos,the user needs to be authenticated.Right now, when I tap to favorite a photo,I get an "Unauthorized" error.Let's go through how we can add user authenticationby using a task-specific delegate.First, let's write a URLSessionTaskDelegate.Let's call it AuthenticationDelegate.The AuthenticationDelegate conformsto the URLSessionTaskDelegate protocol,and it accepts an instance of signInControllerin its initializer.The signInController class we implemented already containssome nice helper functions that we can useto prompt the user for credentials.Next, let's implement the URLSessiondidReceive challenge delegate method.Within the delegate method,we can choose to respond to HTTP basic authentication challengesby prompting the user for credentials.Of course, we should not forget about error handling.Now let's use this AuthenticationDelegate classas our task-specific delegate.To do that, I can just instantiate an instance of itand parse it as the delegate parameterto the URLSession.data method.Note that the delegate object is not an instance variable,and it's strongly held by the taskuntil the task completes or fails.What's new here is that the delegate can be usedto handle events that are specificto an instance of a URLSession task,which is handy when the logic inside your delegate methodsonly applies to certain URLSession tasks and not others.Great. Now when we tap to favorite the photo......it pops up a login form.Once we log in, the photo shows as favorited,and that it has been added to our favorited-photos collection.Back to you, Guoye.Guoye: Thank you, Zhenchao, for the demo.We can't wait for you to try out async/await with URLSession,and we encourage you to apply the same async conceptsto improve your code, including changing functions,taking a completion handler to async functions,and changing repeated events handlers to AsyncSequences.To learn more about advancements in URLSession,we have a video about a cool new instrumentinspecting your app's HTTP trafficand a video about HTTP/3 support in URLSession.Thank you and have a great WWDC!♪
