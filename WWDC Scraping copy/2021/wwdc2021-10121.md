Search this videoâ€¦Hello, I am Nandini Sundara Raman,and today, I will be showing youhow you can tailor the VoiceOver experiencein your data-rich apps using AXCustomContent API.VoiceOver is Apple's screen readerthat lets you interact with any Apple device,even if you can't see the screen.You can use VoiceOver by touching the screento listen to what is under your fingerand then perform simple gestures like swipeto navigate the interface.So, here I have a simple app that I createdcalled Woof Woof Kennelwhere we have detailed descriptions of several dogslisted in a table view,and VoiceOver user can swipe through the listto explore the kennel.Let's have a quick look of the VoiceOver experienceof this app.Bailey, beagle, happy-go-lucky,excellent hunting dog, and loyal companion.Popularity, number one. Age, three years.Weight, 25 pounds. Height, 14 inches.Winston, pug, loving, intelligent,affectionate, loyal, charming,playful, and mischievous.Popularity, number two.Age, three years. Weight, 14 pounds.Height, 10 inches.Whoa! That was a lot of dataread by VoiceOver for each dogwhere all the contents of the cellwas read from top left to bottom right.While navigating an interface with VoiceOver,too much data can be overwhelming,with cognitive load on users,and make your app hard to navigate.And too little datawill result in incomplete experience of your app.Both extremes are frustrating,and finding a balance here might be difficultbecause different users might want different informationwhen using your app.To achieve this balance,we have the Accessibility Custom Content API.This class and protocol in Accessibility frameworkis available on all platforms.A common issue with presenting complex data with Voiceoveris solved by this APIby delivering accessibility information to your usersin measured portions.With this API, you can leverage assistive technologiesto present only the content your app users needwhen they need it.Now, let's look at how AXCustomContent APIcan be implemented in our data-rich apps.And to do that,first I would like to show you how my app lookswith AXCustomContent API implemented.Bailey, beagle. More content available.Yes! You heard that right.VoiceOver just announcedthat we have more content available on this cell.By this, it means that you can accessadditional content on this cellusing the More Content rotor.Voiceover rotors enable users to navigate applicationsquickly and efficiently.It has many built-in usessuch as setting the VoiceOver language,adjusting the speaking rate,and also moving between the links on a web page, etc.Here, with More Content rotor, we can navigatebetween additional content of an elementunder the VoiceOver cursor.To get to the More Content rotor with VoiceOverin iOS devices,twist two fingers on the screenas if rotating a dialtill you reach the desired rotor optionthat is the More Content rotor.More content.And then, swipe down or upto navigate to the next or previous additional contentavailable under the VoiceOver cursor.Now, as I swipe down the cell,VoiceOver will present additional contentpresent on it.Three years, age.Number one, popularity.25 pounds, weight. 14 inches, height.Happy-go-lucky, excellent hunting dog,and loyal companion. Description.Let's see how the macOS version of the same appworks after implementing AXCustomContent API on it.Bailey, beagle. More content available.Once the VoiceOver cursoris on the element with more content,we can bring up the rotor with VO + command + /to reveal its custom content.More Content menu. Five items.Age, three years. Popularity, number one.Weight, 25 pounds.Height, 14 inches.Description, happy-go-lucky,excellent hunting dog, and loyal companion.In iOS, to get notifiedwhen VoiceOver element has additional content,go to VoiceOver preferences and open Verbosity settings.Under Verbosity settings, select More Content.And choose either to speak hints,play sound,or change pitch to get notifiedwhen additional content is available.Similarly, you can set the verbosityof more content available announcement in macOS as well.You can do this using VoiceOver Utility preferences.Now, let's see how we can make our Woof Woof Kennel appsupport Accessibility Custom Content API.Here, we have the DogTableViewCellwith variables for dog photo,name, type, description,popularity, age, weight, and height.To implement AXCustomContent API,we first import Accessibility framework.Then we need to add and implementAXCustomContentProvider Protocol on our TableViewCell.Before implementing the protocol methods,let's override accessibilityLabel propertyand return just the name and the type of the dog,as they are the most relevant details here.We then implement AXCustomContentProviderprotocol method accessibilityCustomContentwith an array of AXCustomContent objectswhere AXCustomContent objectsare a key-value pair of localized strings.Here we create AXCustomContent object for descriptionwith string "Description" as the labeland description's text valueas the value of the AXCustomContent object.We then also create AXCustomContent objectsfor popularity, age,weight, and height as well.We then return an array of all these AXCustomContent objectsin the order you want VoiceOverto present them to your user.Now, let's see how the VoiceOver experiencehas improved after implementingAXCustomContentProvider protocolon our TableViewCell.Bailey, beagle. More content available.Number one, popularity.Three years, age. 25 pounds, weight.14 inches, height.Happy-go-lucky, excellent hunting dog,and loyal companion, description.For a user who is trying to browse this list,the age of the dog might be a crucial information for themif they want to adopt it.Currently, its value is hidden behind the More Content rotor.AXCustomContent object has a property named "importance"that can be used to solve this problem.We can set this property's value to "high,"and the content will always be presentedwhen VoiceOver focuses on the elementwithout cycling through the additional elements.To ensure that the age of the dogis always presented by VoiceOver,we have set the importance propertyon the age custom content object to be "high."Now, here we see that the age of the dogis always read by VoiceOver.Bailey, beagle, three years.More content available.This age information will also be availablein your More Content rotor.New this year is thatwe support the same capability with SwiftUI as well.We can setthe accessibilityCustomContent modifieron our custom views in SwiftUIby passing in localizable text for both labeland the value parametersand set the importance property as needed.This way works well in situationswhere the custom content value is added in one placeand not manipulated later in the hierarchy.To implement this in our DogCell View,we first set the accessibility hidden modifierson description textand on the HStack that contains popularity,age, weight, and height of the dogso that these aren't automatically picked upfor the accessibility label of the DogCell.We then setaccessibilityCustomContent modifiers for agewith importance set to high, popularity,weight, height, and description.If we want our custom content valueto be manipulated in more than one placein the Swift UI hierarchy,we can avoid redefinition of the keyby creating an extension of AccessibilityCustomContentKey.This will give the ability to updateor remove the value for that keywithout recreating the localizable text string.In our DogCell example,we have created an extension ofAccessibilityCustomContentKeyand added age as one of the custom keys.On the DogCell body's VStack,we have added accessibility CustomContent modifierwith the AccessibilityCustomContentKey"age," instead of using a string key here.Finally, here is what we hope you will doto tailor the VoiceOver experienceof our data-rich apps.First, identify visually data-rich parts of your app.Turn on VoiceOver and determine if the contentunder the VoiceOver cursor is too verbose.If it is verbose,implement AXCustomContentProvider protocoland consider moving the supplementary informationto accessibilityCustomContent.Set the importance property to "high"for the information you always want to present to your user.For the VoiceOver users, to have an optionto access their content in measured portionsand have the content presented to themonly when they need it will greatly improvethe Accessibility experience of your app.So now, to give a better experienceto our VoiceOver users,I really encourage you to take a lookat how you can incorporateAXCustomContent APIs into your data-rich apps!And thank you so muchfor watching this session, everyone.Bye-bye![percussive music]
