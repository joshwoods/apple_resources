Understanding Crashes and Crash Logs

Search this video…Hello.Welcome to Triaging TestFlight crashes with Xcode Organizer.My name is Matt, and I'm an Xcode engineer.Today I'm going to show yousome of the new tools we have built into the Xcode Organizerthat will help you triage crashesacross all of your app's targetsand how to leverage feedback from your TestFlight usersso you can get crash fixes into your builds faster.Then I'm going to show you the new Terminations Organizerand advancements we've made in MetricKit.If your app is utilizing TestFlightto test your beta versions,you'll know that crash feedback from your testerscan be really valuable.When a tester writes some feedbackafter they have hit a crash,you can view that feedback in App Store Connectand download the crash logto start analyzing what happened.Later on, I'm going to show you the changes we made in Xcodethat will supercharge this workflow.First, I want to give a quick overviewof the features available before Xcode 13.In the Crashes Organizer, we support crashesfor both apps on the App Store and TestFlight.We show your app's crashes across all of our platforms,including crashes from your App Clip and app extensions.The Organizer ranks your issuesto show you the highest priority crashesand shows you how those crashesare distributed across different devices and OS versions.And once you've decided to start attacking that crash,you can open it directly in your Xcode project.All of these great features work out of the boxby simply signing into Xcode with your developer account.The journey of making a great appcan be long and bumpy at times,because once you ship it, customers always seem tobreak it in ways that you didn't even know were possible.In Xcode 13,we wanted to make the Crashes Organizer even betterso you can continue to get closer to the goalof no crashes.This set us on a missionto make crash log delivery almost instant,provide richer data about your crashes,and give you more contextto help you fix those hard-to-reproduce issues.I am thrilled to show youall of the incredible new features we've added to Xcode 13in the Crashes Organizer.There are six major improvementsthat I'm going to share with you.First, speedy delivery of your TestFlight crashes.Now when any of your testers crash a TestFlight build,we will deliver that crash to you in the Organizerjust moments later.This quick crash delivery now allows you to viewall of your TestFlight crashes from the last day,and you will now have an hourly graphtelling you when the selected crash occurred.In Xcode 13, we're now making a year's worthof crash history available to you.You can now filter crashes by time periodto see all of the crashes that have occurredin the last year.Because we can now show you a year's worth of crashes,you will see a time distributionin the inspector's graph area showing youthe prevalence of a crash on a month-to-month basis.We wanted to give you more tools to better understandthe health across all parts of your app.So this year, we're adding more filters to the Crashes Organizerto allow you to focus on specific parts of your app.The Organizer can now also filter the crashes listby all versions and buildsor drill down to any individual past release.You can also filter by any of the extensionsthat ship with your app, like your watch app,App Clip or share extension.You can even check in how your iOS app is doingrunning on those phenomenal Apple silicon Macs.Part of triaging your app's issuesis getting the full pictureof who is affected by a particular crashand that crash is distributed across different categories.So this year, we've added the abilityto see how a unique crash is distributedacross your app’s versionsand across TestFlight and the App Store.You all have shipped some amazing apps as solo artists,in large teams, and everything in between.In Xcode 13, we are introducing a new wayto collaborate with each other by adding the abilityfor you to share crash reports directly from the Organizer.Using the new Share button in the toolbar,you can share a crash directly with members of your teamor just simply add it to your to-do list.And when you click on one of these links,the Organizer downloads and focuses on this issue,allowing you to zero in on this crash and start investigating.TestFlight is a valuable tool for developersto quickly get new features and fixesin the hands of their testers,who help find new crashes and bugs.Beta testing an app with TestFlighthelps instill confidence in developersthat they are going to be shippinga sweet update to the App Store.I am super excited to announce that in Xcode 13,we are bringing TestFlight Crash Feedbackdirectly into the Crashes Organizer.App Store Connect shows you all of your TestFlight feedback,including crash feedback.You can continue to download the raw feedback and crash logdirectly from App Store Connect or, new this year,you can open the associated crashright in the Organizer with the new Open in Xcode button.Viewing your crash feedback is now easier than ever.There is a new inspector in the Crashes Organizerdedicated to TestFlight crash feedback.Opening this Inspector will show you all of the feedbackthat has been submitted by testersthat have hit the crash you have selected.This allows you to see one unified feedback listalongside your crash reportthat you can quickly sift throughto find that extra bit of information neededto help you fix a crash.We think this added context is invaluablewhen tracking down hard-to-reproduce issues.So a lot of cool new stuff.Let's dive in and start triaging some crashesin the new Crashes Organizer.I've been working on my team's app, Fruta,and we've have recently shipped a new versionto the App Store but are also continuously deployingnew versions to TestFlight with Xcode Cloud.Today I want to see if there have been any recent crashesin our App Clip, so let's open up the Organizerand see what's going on.I can do this by selecting the Window menu bar itemand selecting Organizer.From the sidebar on the left, I can tell that Xcodehas opened to the Crashes Organizerfor my iOS app, Fruta.In the toolbar at the top of the window,you'll notice all of the new filter optionsthat are available this year.Underneath the filter bar is the crashes list,which is showing us all of our crashes for the last two weeksacross all versions, builds, and products.Quickly scanning this list,I can see a number of different kinds of issues.Crashes in the list display various badgesindicating whether they came from our App Clip,our watch app, or an app extension.This allows us to quickly identify which area of our appa crash is affecting.To the right of the crashes list, I see the log view.This is showing me the friendly, simplified view of the crashI have selected in the crashes list.And finally, to the right of the log view,I see the inspector, which shows me all kinds ofinteresting information about the selected crash.Now that we're familiar with the Organizer,I want to take a look at all of our recent issuesfor our App Clip.I can open up the products filter in the toolbarwhich lists all of the products that ship with my app,like our watch app, App Clip, or app extensions.I'll go ahead and select App Clip here.Selecting App Clip has filtered the crashes listto only display our App Clip crashesfrom the last two weeks.The first crash in the list here is our top crash.Underneath the title, the Organizer is letting us knowthat this crash has been affecting 21 devicesin the last two weeks and 7 in the last day.Now, before I start digging into the code,I like to ask myself some questions that will helpguide my investigation and lead me to some context clues.First, how long has this been an issue?If we head over to the inspector's graph areaon the right side of the window,we can tell from the graph legendthat this crash first appeared in version 2.0and is affecting our latest TestFlight build, 2.0.1.Next question, is this affecting my production appor just TestFlight?I can change the filter to Release to find outthat this is affecting both TestFlight and App Store builds.So this issue is pretty important,because our customers are experiencing it,and it looks like it may have regressedin our most recent App Store release.Now let's focus on the log view.The log view is conveniently highlighting for methe exact frame that crashed.I also know that this happened on a background threadby looking at the thread number above the back trace, thread number 6.I can see this is crashing while we're syncing favorites,but isn't an area of code that I work in too often,and so I don't quite know how to reproduce this.I can't really think of more questions to ask myselfthat are going to give me more insight into this crash,so it would be really helpful to get some more context.Fortunately, there's a feedback iconnext to this crash in the list,so I know that one of our testershas experienced this crash and submitted feedback.This might just be the missing piece of context I needto start working on this crash.I can see their feedbackby heading over to the inspector areaand opening the new Feedback Inspector.I see that several testers have hit this same crash,including one who saw it just a minute ago.In the inspector, I can see a previewof each feedback report, or if I click on one,I can see more details in a popover.I'll click on this latest feedback,which opens up a popoverand shows me all of the rich context for this tester's crash,like the exact version and build they had installed,their device model, battery level,and available disk space.These can all be helpful clues when diagnosing a crash.In this case, I can see the tester was on cellular,and their comment says,"I was going through a tunnel and I hit the favorite button.A few seconds later, it crashed."Hmm. if they were going through a tunnel,they might have had a poor network connection.Now we can combine all of our clues togetherto know that pressing the favorite buttonwill trigger some background task that will eventually crash.I think we have enough to start diving into the code.I'll use the Open in Project buttonto open this crash directly in the Fruta Xcode project.OK, so Xcode has opened and is showing the backtracein the Debug Navigator on the left,and the editor with our source fileand the exact line of crashing code highlighted.So why is this code crashing?Well, it seems like we're crashing on purposewith a fatal error, which is an interesting choice.Let's take a quick pass through our syncFavorites functionto understand what it's trying to do.First, we're jumping onto a background thread.Next, it appears like we're saving this smoothieas a favorite to disk.Then we're updating our back end, and we're using a dispatch groupto sync these operations together.We then wait on these operations with a 10-second timeout,and if it takes longer, we crash.This is pretty unfair.Remembering our tester's feedback,it said they were going through a tunnelwhen they favorited a smoothie.If they were going through a tunnel,then they probably had a poor quality network connection,which means that syncing with our backendcould definitely take a lot longer than 10 seconds.This crash makes total sense now.Now that we know that our timeout is too shortand we aren't handling it properly, let's fix this.I've been practicing my Combine skills recently,so I think I want to use Combine to fix this.Awesome.So now we are merging the resultsof two publishers together,and when we timeout, which is now 30 seconds,we call our completion handler rather than crash.Problem solved.Let's head back to the Organizer and mark this issue as resolved.Oh, it looks like my boss just sent me a text.Ooh, Craig hit a crash in his demo.Thankfully, my boss used the new sharing feature in the Organizerto send me the exact crash that Craig hit,so I don't have to go digging for it.When I click on this link,the Organizer creates this focused viewof the single crash that was embedded in that link.I've actually seen this crash before.I just fixed this the other day and marked it as resolved.I also gave the crash a friendlier nameso that I could remember the underlying issue.I'll go ahead and let my boss knowthat I've already fixed this.So we've just looked at how to triage our App Clip crashesusing the new filters in the Organizer,how to use the new distribution graphs in the inspector,and how to make use of our TestFlight feedbackto fix an issue that would have beenotherwise hard to reproduce.Now let's take a look at the new Terminations Organizerand improvements we've made to MetricKit.The new Terminations Organizer shows trends of app terminationsthat may be affecting your customers.The crashes you'll see in the Crashes Organizerare the result of programming failures,but there are other waysthat your app's process can be terminated.Terminations are categorizedby reasons like "timing out on launch"or "hitting the system memory limit."You can compare these categories of termination eventsfor your app against previous versions to find regressions.Some of these terminations happen in the background,but in certain cases,they can happen while your app is onscreen.The Terminations Organizer can help you understandthe difference so you can make a plan to fix them.If you'd like to dive into regressions,check outthe Application performance survival guide sessionthis year, and to learn more about terminations,I recommend checking out the sessionWhy is my app getting killed? from 2020.If you're not familiar,you can use the Apple framework MetricKitto collect crash logs in your code.All you need to do is import MetricKit,begin listening to the MetricKit manager,and use the crashDiagnostics propertyon MetricKit diagnostic payloads when they are received.New this year, crash diagnostics are no longer aggregatedand delivered once dailybut are now delivered on the next launch of your appso you gain access to crash logs faster.I'm also happy to announce that MetricKit now supports macOS.To learn more about using MetricKit,I recommend the sessionWhat's new in MetricKit from 2020.There are many other ways to track down and view crashes.You can access crashes on your connected devicefrom the Devices windowor by sharing a log directly from your device.XCTest will collect your crashes that occurwhen running your tests, and you can use the Console appto view crashes from your Mac and the simulator.For more on these additional tools, check out the sessionUnderstanding crashes and crash logs from 2018.Today we saw some great new features.We hope that the new speedy crash log delivery,TestFlight feedback integration, and distribution metricswill dramatically improve your experience fixes crashesand ultimately improve your app's healthand your users experiences.Thank you for watching.And remember, the road to successis always under construction.[percussive music]

Hello.Welcome to Triaging TestFlight crashes with Xcode Organizer.My name is Matt, and I'm an Xcode engineer.

Today I'm going to show yousome of the new tools we have built into the Xcode Organizerthat will help you triage crashesacross all of your app's targetsand how to leverage feedback from your TestFlight usersso you can get crash fixes into your builds faster.

TestFlight is a valuable tool for developersto quickly get new features and fixesin the hands of their testers,who help find new crashes and bugs.Beta testing an app with TestFlighthelps instill confidence in developersthat they are going to be shippinga sweet update to the App Store.I am super excited to announce that in Xcode 13,we are bringing TestFlight Crash Feedbackdirectly into the Crashes Organizer.

App Store Connect shows you all of your TestFlight feedback,including crash feedback.You can continue to download the raw feedback and crash logdirectly from App Store Connect or, new this year,you can open the associated crashright in the Organizer with the new Open in Xcode button.
