new protocols available in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.We'll begin by exploring the evolution of HTTPand how HTTP/3 improves performance.We'll also talk about QUIC,the new transport protocol behind HTTP/3.After that, we'll explain how you can use HTTP/3 in URLSessionand how you should configure your HTTP serverto support HTTP/3.Finally, we'll take a deep dive into the API for using QUICand how you can implement your custom networking protocolson top of QUIC.Let's then begin with the evolution of HTTP.Let's say we need to fetch a resource.We set up a connection, send the request,wait for the server to process it,and receive a response.Now, if we want to fetch another resourcebefore the first one finishes,we have go through the same process again:setting up a connection, sending the request,waiting for processing, and receiving the response,this time indicated in dark green.Here's another example for a third resource, in orange.As outlined by the diagram,a lot of time is spent on connection setup.What if we reuse a single HTTP/1 connection?We saved the connection set up time,but a request can only be sentafter the previous response has ended.This is known as head-of-line blocking.In the past, HTTP implementationsused many parallel connections to overcome this problem.The number of parallel HTTP connectionswas even configurable by the app.However, this led to inefficient networking behaviorsfor both client and server.HTTP/2 solves head-of-line blockingby multiplexing multiple streams on a single connection.Requests are sent earlier,and data from different streams can be interleaved.This allows more efficient use of a single TCP connection,as idle waiting time is drastically reduced.With HTTP/3, connection set up is much faster,so requests can go out sooner.However, that's not the only benefit of HTTP/3.HTTP/3 streams are independent, which is different from HTTP/2,where all streams share a single TCP connection.On most networks, packets are lost.This is a normal event on wireless networksand a natural part of detecting the capacity of a network.In HTTP/2, packet loss may affect many streamssince all of the HTTP/2 streams share a single TCP connection.In HTTP/3,only the corresponding HTTP stream is affected.Data that belongs to other streamscan be delivered earlier.We've just shown how HTTP/3 can establish a connection soonerand how it can better cope with packet loss.These improvements are enabledby the underlying transport protocol: QUIC.QUIC is a new reliable transport protocolthat has been standardizedby the Internet Engineering Task Force.It's based on the same concepts of TCPbut provides end-to-end encryption,multiplexed streams, and authentication.QUIC's security builds on top of the well-known TLS 1.3 protocol.The major benefit of QUIC is improved performance.Let's explore how QUIC achieves just that.QUIC relies on TLS 1.3 to perform a secure handshakeand does not requirethe familiar TCP three-way handshake,reducing the handshake time to a single round trip.Multiplexed streams are a key concept of QUIC,so it doesn't suffer from head-of-line blocking.A QUIC endpoint is able to communicatemore complex information about packets it has receivedto the other endpoint and is not encumbered by TCP's limits,so QUIC connections experience improved loss recovery.The protocol also supports connection migrationwhich allows connections to move seamlesslyacross different network interfaceswithout reestablishing a session,for example, between cellular networks and Wi-Fi.If you would like to learn more about networking delays,please watch the "Reduce network delays for your app" session.Let's talk about how you can use HTTP/3 in your app.If you're using URLSession,you don't need to change your app since iOS 15and macOS Monterey ship with HTTP/3 enabled by default.Once you enable HTTP/3 on your server,you're good to go.Both the upcoming HTTP/3 RFC versionand the earlier HTTP/3 Draft version 29 are supported.So how can you make sure your app is using HTTP/3?Let's use Instruments to find out!In Xcode 13, we're introducing a new instrumentwithin the networking profiling templateto inspect HTTP Traffic.It taps into URLSession directly,so there's no setup required.We can use Instruments to find outif our app is using HTTP/3 or an earlier HTTP version.We're going to launch an iOS app that, upon starting,fetches a set of dog pictures.We'll then inspect HTTP headers to find outhow the server is advertising HTTP/3.Let's go ahead and select the Network profiling template.Let's click Record on the top left.A prompt will be displayed indicatingthe privacy implications of recording HTTP Traffic.After we agree,Instruments will begin recording HTTP transactions.Next, Instruments will show a plotwith all HTTP transactions per app and per domain.We have now captured all the data that we need.We can click the Pause button located on the top left.Let's select the domain that we're using.We can do that by Option-clickingon the HTTP transactions and then selecting the domain.We need to configure Instrumentsto show the details of the HTTP Transactions.To accomplish that, make sure the menu on the left side showsHTTP Transactions.Let's select the first request.By scrolling right, we can find the HTTP Version columnwhich identifies the version of HTTP that this transaction used.Hm, we're still using HTTP/2, but why is that?On the right-hand side, we can findthe extended detail view that contains the response headers.This give us the answer:the server used HTTP Alternative Servicesto advertise support for HTTP/3.URLSession won't use HTTP/3 unless it was advertised.In this example, HTTP/3 was advertisedthrough the Alt-Svc HTTP header.It's common for HTTP servers to advertise support for HTTP/3,using this header.This information is remembered for future connections,and we call this "service discovery."Now let's record the app again.Once Instruments relaunches the app,the same set of HTTP transactions take place.Again, we can now pause Instruments.Let's zoom in again and inspect the first transaction.Since we've remembered that the server supported HTTP/3,we're now using HTTP/3.HTTP/3 service discovery is transparent to your app.Discovery of HTTP/3 server support happens in two ways.The recommended approach is to configure your DNS serverto advertise support for HTTP/3through the HTTPS resource record.Simply configure the application layer protocolto advertise HTTP/3 using the h3 string.You should also configure your serverto add a new header that advertises HTTP/3using Alternative Services.Your server should send a Alt-Svc headerthat advertises HTTP/3.This includes the port number and the max-age of the service,in seconds.The advantage of the DNS record is thatsince the information is in DNS,an HTTP/3 connection can be establishedthe very first time your app tries to contact to your server.When you know that your server supports HTTP/3,and you would like to speed up the discovery process,you can use the assumesHTTP3Capable property.This allows the HTTP stackto assume that you have an HTTP/3 serverbut does not guarantee that HTTP/3 will be used.Networks may still block HTTP/3,or your server may not actually support HTTP/3.In that case, we'll fall back to HTTP/2.HTTP allows clients to specify priorities for each resource.Since resources are often related,priorities allow the server to send some resourcesearlier than others,based on the needs of the client.For example, user experience for web browsing can be improvedby prioritizing resourcesthat affect web page rendering the most.A priority scheme was introduced in HTTP/2but it was not often respected due to its complexity.For that reason, the old priority modelwas removed from HTTP/3.A new, simpler model, which relies on HTTP headers,is used by the HTTP/3 stack.In this model, priority is specifiedwith an urgency parameter -- zero to seven --and an optional incremental delivery parameter.When using URLSession,the API to support priorities remains the same.You still specify the HTTP priority,using the priority property,which is communicated to the server using urgency.You can enable incremental delivery withthe prefersIncrementalDelivery property.The default priority is 3.URLSession infers incremental deliverydepending on whether a convenience API --like the async data method -- is used.When your app is downloading content that cannot be processeduntil the entire resource is downloaded,you should set this property to false.Dynamically changing the priority of a resourceafter the request was sent is also supported.For example, you can prefetch photos at a lower priorityand then raise that priorityas the user navigates to that section of your app.Next, my colleague Eric is going to explainhow you can change your custom networking protocolsto adopt QUIC.Thank you.Eric Kinnear: Thanks, Rui!As we discussed earlier, HTTP/3 is built on top of QUIC,which provides multiplexed streams,similar to those found in HTTP/2,but without the problems introducedby sharing a single TCP connectionas the underlying transport.A QUIC transport connection -- or QUIC tunnel --multiplexes data for multiple unidirectionalor bidirectional QUIC streams.Streams can be created by either endpoint,can concurrently send data interleaved with other streams,and have states similar to the traditional streamsprovided by TCP.Best of all, QUIC has TLS 1.3 security built right inand can better respond to changing network conditions.These capabilities are useful for more than just HTTP.If your application is exchangingnon-request/response based data,could benefit from having multiplexed streamsthat share an underlying transport context,or is implementing any other custom protocol --such as peer-to-peer communication or RPC calls --consider using QUIC transport for your app.In iOS 15 and macOS Monterey,NWProtocolQUIC joins the other built-in protocolsprovided by Network.framework.Creating a connection that uses QUIC is very familiar.Simply provide your endpointand the newly available QUIC parameters.These parameters specify the ALPN string,the application layer protocol to negotiate with the server.Set a state update handler -- just like usual --to be able to respond as the connection makes progressand becomes ready.And, finally, start your connection on a dispatch queuethat you'd like to use for those state updatesand other callbacks.Now that you've got a QUIC stream established,you can send and receive datajust like any other NWConnection.Use the send function to provide the data you'd like to sendto the remote endpoint,and schedule subsequent sends when complete.Use receive to handle incoming data,and schedule subsequent receives when it completes.Last year, we introduced the Connection Group objectin Network.frameworkto make it easier to handle situationswhere multiple connections are related or grouped.QUIC streams that are multiplexedon an underlying transport context --or tunnel --are logically grouped based on that relationshipand can be used with a new group type:NWMultiplexGroup.A Connection Group follows a lifecyclesimilar to that of the other Network.framework objectsand allows you to reason about the stateof the underlying QUIC tunnel shared by your QUIC streams.It also allows you to create new outgoing streamsfrom a specific QUIC tunnel as well as receivenew incoming streams initiated by the remote endpoint.To create a connection group for a multiplexing protocol,use a multiplex group descriptor.In this case, we'll create a group descriptorto example.com on port 443.Next, we create a NWConnectionGroupwith that descriptor and QUIC parameters,providing our ALPN string when we create them.Just like with an NWConnection, we set a state update handler,but this time,it's tracking the state of the underlying QUIC tunnel,rather than the state of an individual stream.Finally, we start the connection group,providing our callback queue.New outgoing streams can be created by initializinga NWConnection from the groupor by calling the extract function on the group.Incoming streams initiated by the remote endpointcan be handled by setting the new connection handleron the group.These connections can be set up as usual with a state handler --this time tracking the stream state --and started with the queue to use for callbacks.Just like with other protocols,you can use QUIC.Options for configurationwhen creating your parameter's object.For QUIC, you can configure the transport parameterslisted in the QUIC specification,and you can also customize properties of individual streamswhen creating them from a connection group;for example, if you want create a new, unidirectional stream.If you're using NWListener to run a server in your app,it has also been enhancedto allow you to receive new incoming QUIC tunnelsvia the newConnectionGroupHandler.Your newConnectionGroupHandler will be calledevery time someone establishes a new QUIC tunnelto your server.Inside that handler, you can set up the group as usualto receive state updates.This is also a good place to set the new connection handlerwe were just discussing.If you'd like to receive subsequent streamsopened on this tunnel,start the group with the queue to use for callbacks,and you're all set!Finally, you can use NWProtocolMetadatato access information about streams.For example, you might want to check the stream IDof a newly created stream.And when you're done with a stream,if your custom protocol has defined applicationError codes,you can use the metadata to communicate any errorsto the remote endpoint before you cancel the stream.So we've just explored how we can usethe new NWMultiplexGroup typeto create and manage QUIC tunnels,and from that group,create individual NWConnections for each QUIC stream.We can use a NWListener to listen for incoming tunnels,and use the resulting connection groupsto receive new incoming streams.On those streams, we can send and receive datajust like on any other connection,and we can use QUIC protocol optionsto specify transport parameters and configure streams,while using QUIC protocol metadatato inspect the streams and communicateQUIC-specific information to the remote endpoint.Now that we've improved the networking in our appby adopting QUIC, how do we tell if it's working?We can launch our app while debugging,with a new environment variable that outputs qlog files.qlog is a new standardized logging formatproposed in the IETF,which allows you to export even richer informationabout how your QUIC connections are behavingthan would be present in a traditional packet capture.After your test run, you can use the Devices window in Xcodeto download your app's containerwith the qlog files for analysis.And there are a numberof different open-source visualizationsthat make it much easierto introspect the behavior of your QUIC connections.Today, we've examined the improvementsthat HTTP/3 provides for your HTTP traffic.On the client, it's already on by defaultfor users of the modern networking APIs,so enable HTTP/3 on your server to take advantageof its increased performance and resilienceto changing network conditions.If you're using a custom, non-HTTP networking protocol,use the new multiplexing protocol supportbuilt into Network.framework to create QUIC connectionswith NWConnectionGroup.And whichever protocol you're using,you can use new debugging toolsto visualize the awesome benefitsof the next generation of networking protocols.Thanks for watching.♪
