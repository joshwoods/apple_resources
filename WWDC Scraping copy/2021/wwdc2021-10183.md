My name is Pierre.I’m a manager on our Communication Applications team,and I’ll later be joined by my colleague Bhaskar.It’s my pleasure to welcome you to “Meet Group Activities.”I think we can all recognize that this past year,finding ways to stay connectedhas felt more essential than ever.This is incredibly important to us at Apple,and we wanted to give our users meaningful new ways to connect.As a result, in iOS 15,we’re creating a new way to enjoy activities togetherthat makes you feel like you’re in the same roomas the people sharing with you.And we call it "SharePlay."SharePlay is powered by the Group Activities framework,and in this session, we’re going to talk abouthow you can adopt it in your application.Before we get into some of those details,let me tell you a bit more about the key components of SharePlay.Let’s start with communication.We think dynamic and natural communicationis a critically important partof a meaningful shared experience,so we’ve built SharePlay right into FaceTime and Messages.We are continually blown awayby how central these apps have become in people’s livesand relationships, especially over the last year.And people don’t just use FaceTime and Messagesto connect with that friend from 30 years agoonce in a while.Instead, our users spend a significant amount of timecommunicating with the people that are closest to them;their closest friends, and their closest family.Those are the kind of people you would inviteinto your living room to watch a movie, for example,and that’s exactly what we want to facilitate with SharePlay.Let me give you an idea of how this works.It all starts with the concept of a session.Before a group starts an activity,they need to join a session so that everyone is togetherand ready to share.Once users are in a session, they can communicate via text,audio, and video in Messages and FaceTimejust like they are used to.Switching between these modes of communicationis dynamic and fluid,so they can easily choose a way to communicatethat matches the moment.We also give users a consistent system-wide wayto manage their session.Users can invite new people on the flyor leave the session entirely.Once you are in a session,users can navigate the entire system and drop in on any app.As a developer, you get it at all for freewith Group Activities.So that’s communication.The next area we think is critical is platform experience.We want this experience to be simple, consistent,and available across our system and devices.With Group Activities,we’re building a unified experiencethat works across iOS, iPadOS, macOS,where Group Activities is availableeven for your website with WebKit.It also works beautifully on AppleTV,so you can enjoy it on the big screen.All of your devices are aware when you are in a session,so you can join from any device,and you can use multiple devices seamlessly.Finally, we also designed it to deliver great audioto Bluetooth devices, including AirPods.As part of platform experience,we’re doing something special for content playback.While we’re hoping you take full advantageof the expressiveness of the APIto create many different types of SharePlay activities,we created some really cool enhancementsthat make shared media experiences effortless to build.The core of any media experience is the play button;it’s the moment when your users decidewhat content they want to spend their time on.Our goal is for every play buttonthroughout the system to work with SharePlay.We want people to feel that any piece of media in your appis ready to kick off a shared experiencewhenever they’re on FaceTime with their friends,which is where you come in.We’re offering new APIsdesigned to fit right into your existing code paths.By adopting Group Activities,your play buttons can now start these shared media experienceswhenever a group conversation is active.And we’ll use smarts over time to adapt to user behaviors,making shared experiences effortless.Next is time-synced playback.We think it’s super importantthat people are laughing together,smiling together,and reacting to content all at the same time.SharePlay handles keeping playback timesynced at the platform level,so you can simply adopt and not have to worry aboutrolling your own.Now, this was a challenging problem to solvewhen it came to consuming content with SharePlay.We wanted to allow people to experiencethe exact same moments with one another,even if they were halfway across the world.Imagine seeing and hearing your friends laugh at somethingthat hasn’t happened yet.Spoiler alert!So we built an entirely new playback-sync protocolwith deep integration into the AVFoundation stackon the device.That means someone hits play,and everyone in the group immediately starts playbackat the same time.Jump to a favorite scene and everyone else sees it too,allowing people to experience moments togetherin perfect sync,as if they were in the same room.The magic behind this playback synchronizationmeans we won’t retransmit your media in any way.Everyone will get your full-fidelity videobecause it’s playing right from your appand streaming from your servers as it always does.And by ensuring that all viewers are watchingthe highest-quality video,they’ll get an immersive social-viewing experiencethat never compromises the quality of your content.We’re also doing some groundbreaking workto make communication feel natural during playback.With smart volume,when people speak up during playback,we’ll automatically duck the audio of the contentand bring it back up when appropriate.So people can communicate via voice, video,and text naturally, just like they wouldif they were sitting in the very same room.And of course,it works beautifully with Picture in Picture,so the user can take your content along with themas they multitask on the device.So that’s a brief overview of what we’re doing on platform.And finally, content. And that’s where you come in.We want users to be able to enjoy the very best contentthat you've made available in your apps.When people are on a FaceTime call,they will expect to be able to go into your appand share your content.SharePlay is going to allow youto extend the touchpoints of your productand increase the timeswhere your app is relevant to your users.And this will happen very organically.Existing users will evangelize for your appas they are using SharePlay with other people.Now that I’ve given you a brief overviewof some of the key components of SharePlay,let’s turn our attention to Group Activities,a core concept of the framework.A Group Activity is an object representing somethingthat can be shared and enjoyedwith the people in the FaceTime call using SharePlay.Let me walk you through how a user would starta Group Activity in your app.While on a call, users can navigate to your app,and if you have adopted Group Activities,they will be notified that the app supports SharePlay.To configure the activity you want to share,you first need to create an objectthat implements the GroupActivity protocol.Once you’ve configured your activity,you call the prepareForActivation APIto start sharing that activity.This API will offer the user the optionto share that activity with everyone in the FaceTime callor just keep it local.If they decide to share with the group,Group Activities will notify youand let you join the GroupSession object.Once users have joined the Group Session,their video will be kept in sync with the group,even when they play, pause, or seek.Whenever those events happen,Group Activities will automatically notify the useras shown here.And finally, once users are done,they can choose to end the activity for themselvesor for the whole group.It’s as simple as that!Now, let me hand it over to Bhaskarwho's going to walk you through the rest of this presentation.Bhaskar Sarma: Thank you, Pierre.Hi, my name is Bhaskar,and I am an engineer on the FaceTime team.Now let’s talk about some of the high-level conceptsand architecture behind this new framework.GroupActivities is a Swift-native frameworkthat allows you to create shared experiencesbetween users of your applicationwhen they are on a FaceTime call.Additionally, the framework also has a tight integrationwith AVFoundation,which allows you to easily createshared video and audio playback experiences.Before we go over the high-level conceptsbehind the API,I would like to talk about two key parts of the API,and these are the GroupActivity and GroupSession.GroupActivity is what your app usesto define the shared experience.It holds the information that your application needsfor the shared experience.For example, if you are doinga shared audio or video playback experience,it might hold the URL of the content that is being played.Or your application might providea custom shared experience.For example, you could be providinga draw-together experience.In that case, this would hold informationabout what the users are drawing.GroupSession is basically a representation of the grouptaking part in the shared experience.It provides access to thingslike the participants in the group.And there are additional APIs in the frameworkthat you can use along with the GroupSessionto send and receive data across devices.Please note the GroupSessionis not meant to exchange large amounts of data.For example, if you are creating a shared listening experience,the GroupSession is not usedto exchange the contents of the song.Instead, this channel is used by AVFoundationto keep content in syncby exchanging the play, pause, or seek commands.Also, the communication medium provided by GroupSessionis end-to-end encrypted.This means no one other than your applicationon the device can read the datathat is exchanged over this channel.Here I have two phones on the screen.The one on the left is my phone,and the one on the right is my teammate Pierre’s phone.And we are on a FaceTime call.Also, we have a sample applicationcalled "Awesome App" on the screen,and the app is ready to start a shared experiencebetween me and Pierre.So in this case, the application on the device on the leftis going to initiate the activity.The first thing the application needs to do is create an objectthat conforms to the GroupActivity protocol.In the example shown here, it is the AwesomeActivity objectthat conforms to GroupActivity.As I had mentioned earlier,this object conforming to the GroupActivity protocolcontains information about the shared activity.For example, if you are creating a shared playback experience,it will have information about what content to play.Or if you are creating a custom experience --like drawing something together --it will have information about what to draw.Once the app has created an activity,the next thing it needs to do is call prepareForActivationon the activity.This causes the user to see a prompt asking for permissionif they want to start an activity.We would like to take user consentbefore starting an activityas we do not want to cause surprise to them.Hence, this step is essential.And lastly, after the user has granted permissionto start the activity,your app needs to call activate on the activity object.This tells the systemthat your app wants to start a shared experience.Next, let’s talk about observing sessions.Here we have the same app that we were looking at earlier.The application at this pointhas called activate on the activity object.Your application then needs to iterateover incoming sessions via an AsyncSequenceon the GroupSession class.And then, when there is a session,the application gets handed the GroupSession objectfor the shared experience.Please note that this is the same stepyour application would takewhether it was the initiating appor on the remote device receiving the session.To go into more details about initiatingand observing group sessions,I would recommend you watch this WWDC session.Now that the application has been handed a session,it needs to set itself up before joining the session.Setting up the application before joiningcould mean different thingsbased on the specific use case of the application.For example, if you are creating a custom experience --like drawing something together --this could mean loading up the assetsneeded for the shared experiencebefore your user can join the experience.However, if your applicationis providing a shared media-playback experience,then it would involve something like this.Your application will hook up theAVPlaybackCoordinator of your AVPlayerto the GroupSessionso that its associated AVPlayer can sync contentover the communication channel provided by the framework.Keep in mind,this syncing support is not just limited to AVPlayer,but you can use any other custom video playeryou have todayand still get support for syncingvia an AVDelegating PlaybackCoordinator.And finally, once you are done setting up your application,your application calls join on the GroupSession.Once join is called, the system sets upthe end-to-end encrypted channels between the appsrunning across different devices.At this point, your application is ready to sync dataand let your users take part in the shared experience.If you're creating a custom experience,your application can use this channel to exchange datato keep your users in sync.This channel is also used by AVFoundationto keep media playback in sync by exchanging playback statewhen the user hits play, pause, skip, et cetera.Note that this channel is not meant to be usedto exchange large amounts of data.Instead, use it to exchange informationto keep your users in sync.Now your application is in a session,and your users are enjoying the shared experience.There is one more thing you can doto enrich the experience for your users,and that is post events using the framework.Events allow your users to know what is going onin the shared experience.For example, you can post events to let your users knowwhen someone plays, pauses, or skips a track.Posting an event causes the system to present a noticetelling your users about the event.In our current API,we only let you post events for media playback experiences.You get this for free if you use an AVPlayeror use an AVDelegating PlaybackCoordinator.However, if you are not using either of these,your app can still post events using the framework.To learn more about providing your own custom experienceand about posting events,I would recommend you watch this WWDC session.So to wrap up,Group Activities is a brand new Swift-native frameworkthat allows you to create shared experiencesover FaceTime.The framework is cross-platform and is availableon iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and tvOS.It has tight integration with AVFoundationthat allows your app to provideshared media playback experiences.And finally, it also has support for playback syncingover the web on macOS.And with that, I would like to thank youfor watching our session.And have a wonderful WWDC21!♪

Once users are in a session, they can communicate via text,audio, and video in Messages and FaceTimejust like they are used to.

Switching between these modes of communicationis dynamic and fluid,so they can easily choose a way to communicatethat matches the moment.

We also give users a consistent system-wide wayto manage their session.

Users can invite new people on the flyor leave the session entirely.

Once you are in a session,users can navigate the entire system and drop in on any app.

As a developer, you get it at all for freewith Group Activities.

So that’s communication.

The next area we think is critical is platform experience.

We want this experience to be simple, consistent,and available across our system and devices.

With Group Activities,we’re building a unified experiencethat works across iOS, iPadOS, macOS,where Group Activities is availableeven for your website with WebKit.

And finally, once users are done,they can choose to end the activity for themselvesor for the whole group.

It’s as simple as that!Now, let me hand it over to Bhaskarwho's going to walk you through the rest of this presentation.

Bhaskar Sarma: Thank you, Pierre.

Hi, my name is Bhaskar,and I am an engineer on the FaceTime team.

Now let’s talk about some of the high-level conceptsand architecture behind this new framework.

GroupActivities is a Swift-native frameworkthat allows you to create shared experiencesbetween users of your applicationwhen they are on a FaceTime call.

Additionally, the framework also has a tight integrationwith AVFoundation,which allows you to easily createshared video and audio playback experiences.

Before we go over the high-level conceptsbehind the API,I would like to talk about two key parts of the API,and these are the GroupActivity and GroupSession.

GroupActivity is what your app usesto define the shared experience.

It holds the information that your application needsfor the shared experience.

For example, if you are doinga shared audio or video playback experience,it might hold the URL of the content that is being played.

Or your application might providea custom shared experience.

For example, you could be providinga draw-together experience.

In that case, this would hold informationabout what the users are drawing.

GroupSession is basically a representation of the grouptaking part in the shared experience.

It provides access to thingslike the participants in the group.

And there are additional APIs in the frameworkthat you can use along with the GroupSessionto send and receive data across devices.

Please note the GroupSessionis not meant to exchange large amounts of data.

For example, if you are creating a shared listening experience,the GroupSession is not usedto exchange the contents of the song.

Instead, this channel is used by AVFoundationto keep content in syncby exchanging the play, pause, or seek commands.

Also, the communication medium provided by GroupSessionis end-to-end encrypted.

This means no one other than your applicationon the device can read the datathat is exchanged over this channel.

Here I have two phones on the screen.

The one on the left is my phone,and the one on the right is my teammate Pierre’s phone.

And we are on a FaceTime call.

Also, we have a sample applicationcalled "Awesome App" on the screen,and the app is ready to start a shared experiencebetween me and Pierre.

So in this case, the application on the device on the leftis going to initiate the activity.

The first thing the application needs to do is create an objectthat conforms to the GroupActivity protocol.

In the example shown here, it is the AwesomeActivity objectthat conforms to GroupActivity.

As I had mentioned earlier,this object conforming to the GroupActivity protocolcontains information about the shared activity.

For example, if you are creating a shared playback experience,it will have information about what content to play.

Or if you are creating a custom experience --like drawing something together --it will have information about what to draw.

Once the app has created an activity,the next thing it needs to do is call prepareForActivationon the activity.

This causes the user to see a prompt asking for permissionif they want to start an activity.

We would like to take user consentbefore starting an activityas we do not want to cause surprise to them.

Hence, this step is essential.

And lastly, after the user has granted permissionto start the activity,your app needs to call activate on the activity object.

This tells the systemthat your app wants to start a shared experience.

Next, let’s talk about observing sessions.

Here we have the same app that we were looking at earlier.

The application at this pointhas called activate on the activity object.

Your application then needs to iterateover incoming sessions via an AsyncSequenceon the GroupSession class.

And then, when there is a session,the application gets handed the GroupSession objectfor the shared experience.

Please note that this is the same stepyour application would takewhether it was the initiating appor on the remote device receiving the session.

To go into more details about initiatingand observing group sessions,I would recommend you watch this WWDC session.

Now that the application has been handed a session,it needs to set itself up before joining the session.

Setting up the application before joiningcould mean different thingsbased on the specific use case of the application.

For example, if you are creating a custom experience --like drawing something together --this could mean loading up the assetsneeded for the shared experiencebefore your user can join the experience.

However, if your applicationis providing a shared media-playback experience,then it would involve something like this.

Your application will hook up theAVPlaybackCoordinator of your AVPlayerto the GroupSessionso that its associated AVPlayer can sync contentover the communication channel provided by the framework.

Keep in mind,this syncing support is not just limited to AVPlayer,but you can use any other custom video playeryou have todayand still get support for syncingvia an AVDelegating PlaybackCoordinator.

And finally, once you are done setting up your application,your application calls join on the GroupSession.

Once join is called, the system sets upthe end-to-end encrypted channels between the appsrunning across different devices.

At this point, your application is ready to sync dataand let your users take part in the shared experience.

If you're creating a custom experience,your application can use this channel to exchange datato keep your users in sync.

This channel is also used by AVFoundationto keep media playback in sync by exchanging playback statewhen the user hits play, pause, skip, et cetera.

Note that this channel is not meant to be usedto exchange large amounts of data.

Instead, use it to exchange informationto keep your users in sync.

Now your application is in a session,and your users are enjoying the shared experience.

There is one more thing you can doto enrich the experience for your users,and that is post events using the framework.

Events allow your users to know what is going onin the shared experience.

For example, you can post events to let your users knowwhen someone plays, pauses, or skips a track.

Posting an event causes the system to present a noticetelling your users about the event.

In our current API,we only let you post events for media playback experiences.

You get this for free if you use an AVPlayeror use an AVDelegating PlaybackCoordinator.

However, if you are not using either of these,your app can still post events using the framework.

To learn more about providing your own custom experienceand about posting events,I would recommend you watch this WWDC session.

So to wrap up,Group Activities is a brand new Swift-native frameworkthat allows you to create shared experiencesover FaceTime.

The framework is cross-platform and is availableon iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and tvOS.

It has tight integration with AVFoundationthat allows your app to provideshared media playback experiences.

And finally, it also has support for playback syncingover the web on macOS.

And with that, I would like to thank youfor watching our session.

And have a wonderful WWDC21!♪
