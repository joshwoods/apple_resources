Diagnose unreliable code with test repetitionsTest repetitions can help you debug even the most unreliable code. Discover how you can use the maximum repetitions, until failure, and retry on failure testing modes within test plans, Xcode, and xcodebuild to track down bugs and crashers and make your app more stable for everyone.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend being familiar with XCTest and managing tests through test plans.

Search this video…Hello and welcome to WWDC 2021.I'm Suzy, and I work on XCTest in Xcode.In this session, we're gonna learn about howto diagnose unreliable code with test repetitions,a tool to repeat your tests.In the process of running tests that exercise your app,your tests may occasionally fail when running unreliable code.You may run into this type of inconsistencywhen dealing with race conditions,environment assumptions,global state, or communication with external services.These are hard bugs to track downbecause they're challenging to reproduce.One way to diagnose these types of failuresis to run your tests repeatedly.Test repetition, added in Xcode 13,allows you to repeat a test up to a specified numberof iterations with a stopping condition.Xcode supports three test repetition modes.The first mode is Fixed iterations.Fixed iterations will repeat your testsa fixed number of times regardless of the status.Fixed iterations is great for understandingthe reliability of your test suite and helpingkeep it reliable as new tests are introduced over time.The second is Until failure.Until failure will continue to repeat a test until it fails.I love using this tool to reproduce a nondeterministictest failure to catch it in the debugger.Lastly is Retry on failure.Retry on failure will retry your testuntil it succeeds up to a specified maximum.This is useful to identify unreliable testswhich fail initially but eventually succeed on reattempt.If a test in CI is exhibiting this behavior,you could enable Retry on failurein your test plan temporarilyand gather additional data to fix the issue.It's important to remember retrying failurescan hide problems in the actual product.Some functionality fails initiallybefore eventually succeeding,so it's best to use this mode temporarilyto diagnose the failures.Let's get a better understanding of how this works in practice.I created an app called IceCreamTruckCountdownthat tells me how long until the ice cream truckdrives by my home.I love when the truck has cookies and cream,and so I wrote a test called testFlavorsto ensure that the truck has all the flavors.testFlavors has a truck that I get from the truckDepot.I call prepareFlavors and, lastly,assert that the truck has all 33 flavors.Recently, I've noticed testFlavorssometimes fails on the main branch in Xcode Cloud.To gather more information, I temporarily configuredmy test plan,enabling Test Repetition Mode to Retry on failure.Let's take a look at the report navigatorand check our cloud reports.My tests are inconsistently failing,so let's check this last one for more information.If I expand the first device open,there is an iteration label here letting us knowit was the first iteration of this test.Huh. And when I expand all the other rows,the assertion failures are all the same,and this last test passed.I expected all the tests to pass consistently,not just on one device.I'm gonna try to reproduce this failure locally.Let's go to our file that has testFlavors.I'll Control-click on the test diamond for our test.In the menu, I'll select Run "testFlavors()" Repeatedly…to bring up the test repetition dialog.Here you can select the stopping conditionof your repetitions,set Maximum Repetitions,and other options like Pause on Failure.I want to try to reproduce the issue that happenedin our cloud report, so I'm setting my stopping conditionto go through maximum repetitions and keep it at 100.Now I'll run my test.Oh, yay! The test failed locally.When I click on the failure annotation,it displays the same error that happened in Xcode Cloud,and it failed 4 out of 100 times.Great! I can now debug this issue.I'll Control-click again on the test diamondfor testFlavors,selecting Run "testFlavors()" Repeatedly…but this time, I'm gonna use stop on failureso I can debug the issue when it happens.Thankfully, Xcode automatically selects Pause on Failure for me,so I can catch the error in the debugger.All right, we have caught the issue.And I know we're looking at inconsistencieswith the flavors on the truck, so I'll take a lookat our truck object in the debugger.It seems strange that flavors is 0 when it should be 33because we already called prepareFlavors.I wonder if we've made it inside this completionHandler.I'll add a breakpoint and click Continue.Hmm, that seems wrong.Oh, the fulfill is called in the outer completionHandlerand not the inner prepareFlavors completionHandler.This is a fairly simple bug caused by asynchronous eventswith multiple completionHandlers and the expectationnot being fulfilled in the correct place.XCTest's support for Swift 5.5's async/awaitlets me simplify this test so it won't happen again.To transform this test to use async/await,I'll add “async throws” to the method header.I'll use the “await” version of gettingthe iceCreamTruck from the truckDepot.I'll use the "await" version of prepareFlavors.I'll keep the same assert, but the truck is no longer optional.Let's run this test one more timeto make sure that it is fixed.I'll Control-click and select Run "testFlavors()" Repeatedly…and once again select Maximum Repetitionsas the stop condition.Yay! The test passed 100 times.I'm now confident that this is fixed,and I'm ready to remove Retry on failurefrom the test plan and commit my change.So we just got a better understandingof how to use this at deskand one way to run your test repeatedly in CIby configuring it in your test plan.Let's talk about another way to run your testswith repetition, like in the demo, using the CLI.When running xcodebuild directly,you can add xcodebuild flagswhich override any test plan setting.Pass -test-iterations with a numberto run a test a fixed number of timesor combine it with -retry-tests-on-failureor -run-tests-until-failureto use it with one of the other stopping conditions.To run your test the same as in the demo with xcodebuild,you start with the base xcodebuild commandused to run your tests and add the flags-test-iterations set to 100 and -run-tests-until-failure.In summary, use test repetitions as a toolto help diagnose unreliable code.For more information about handling inconsistent tests,watch "Embrace expected failures in XCTest."To learn more about Swift async, check out"Meet async/await in Swift."Thanks for watching.[percussive music]

In the process of running tests that exercise your app,your tests may occasionally fail when running unreliable code.

You may run into this type of inconsistencywhen dealing with race conditions,environment assumptions,global state, or communication with external services.These are hard bugs to track downbecause they're challenging to reproduce.One way to diagnose these types of failuresis to run your tests repeatedly.Test repetition, added in Xcode 13,allows you to repeat a test up to a specified numberof iterations with a stopping condition.Xcode supports three test repetition modes.The first mode is Fixed iterations.Fixed iterations will repeat your testsa fixed number of times regardless of the status.Fixed iterations is great for understandingthe reliability of your test suite and helpingkeep it reliable as new tests are introduced over time.The second is Until failure.Until failure will continue to repeat a test until it fails.I love using this tool to reproduce a nondeterministictest failure to catch it in the debugger.Lastly is Retry on failure.Retry on failure will retry your testuntil it succeeds up to a specified maximum.This is useful to identify unreliable testswhich fail initially but eventually succeed on reattempt.If a test in CI is exhibiting this behavior,you could enable Retry on failurein your test plan temporarilyand gather additional data to fix the issue.It's important to remember retrying failurescan hide problems in the actual product.Some functionality fails initiallybefore eventually succeeding,so it's best to use this mode temporarilyto diagnose the failures.Let's get a better understanding of how this works in practice.I created an app called IceCreamTruckCountdownthat tells me how long until the ice cream truckdrives by my home.I love when the truck has cookies and cream,and so I wrote a test called testFlavorsto ensure that the truck has all the flavors.testFlavors has a truck that I get from the truckDepot.

My tests are inconsistently failing,so let's check this last one for more information.

If I expand the first device open,there is an iteration label here letting us knowit was the first iteration of this test.

Huh. And when I expand all the other rows,the assertion failures are all the same,and this last test passed.I expected all the tests to pass consistently,not just on one device.I'm gonna try to reproduce this failure locally.Let's go to our file that has testFlavors.

Now I'll run my test.

Oh, yay! The test failed locally.When I click on the failure annotation,it displays the same error that happened in Xcode Cloud,and it failed 4 out of 100 times.Great! I can now debug this issue.I'll Control-click again on the test diamondfor testFlavors,selecting Run "testFlavors()" Repeatedly…but this time, I'm gonna use stop on failureso I can debug the issue when it happens.Thankfully, Xcode automatically selects Pause on Failure for me,so I can catch the error in the debugger.

All right, we have caught the issue.And I know we're looking at inconsistencieswith the flavors on the truck, so I'll take a lookat our truck object in the debugger.

It seems strange that flavors is 0 when it should be 33because we already called prepareFlavors.I wonder if we've made it inside this completionHandler.I'll add a breakpoint and click Continue.

Hmm, that seems wrong.

Oh, the fulfill is called in the outer completionHandlerand not the inner prepareFlavors completionHandler.

I'll use the “await” version of gettingthe iceCreamTruck from the truckDepot.

I'll use the "await" version of prepareFlavors.

I'll keep the same assert, but the truck is no longer optional.

Let's run this test one more timeto make sure that it is fixed.I'll Control-click and select Run "testFlavors()" Repeatedly…and once again select Maximum Repetitionsas the stop condition.

Yay!
